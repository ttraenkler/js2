# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added: reusable `FyiSourceExecutor` for external test262 integrations (#3599)

- `FyiSourceExecutor` and `runTest` are now exported from the new
  `@loopdive/js2/test262-fyi` subpath (added to `package.json`'s `exports`
  map — this subpath was previously unreachable via `import`, even though
  `js2-test262` shipped as a bin). `executeTestFile({ ..., executor })` now
  accepts an optional pre-existing executor: an external caller that runs
  many test files in one long-lived process (e.g. a persistent server) can
  reuse a single warm executor across many calls instead of paying a fresh
  Node start + full compiler-module load per call. Omitting `executor`
  preserves the exact prior one-shot behavior.
- Fixed a real bug this surfaced: `FyiSourceExecutor`'s default `workerPath`
  resolved to a `scripts/` path that only exists in the monorepo checkout,
  not in the published package — `new FyiSourceExecutor()` with no explicit
  `workerPath` threw `Cannot find module '.../scripts/test262-worker.mjs'`
  when called from outside this repo. It now resolves lazily next to its own
  module location, matching the (already-correct) logic `js2-test262`'s CLI
  entry point used internally.

### Added: relocatable standalone CLI bundle (#1775, GH #986 follow-up)

- Added `pnpm run build:standalone-cli`, which writes
  `dist/js2wasm-standalone.mjs` for `deno compile` / `bun build --compile`
  workflows. This build bundles the core compiler dependencies and injects
  TypeScript's `lib.*.d.ts` files into the existing bundled-lib hook, so the
  generated file does not need to stay next to `node_modules/typescript/lib`.
- Standalone bundles now get the package version injected at build time, so
  `--version` does not rely on `../package.json` after the file is moved.
- Binaryen is now an optional peer/dev dependency and is no longer bundled into
  the standalone CLI artifact; `-O` can use an installed `binaryen` package or a
  `wasm-opt` binary on PATH, and the emitted `.wasm` can be optimized afterward.
- The standalone docs now recommend `--minify`, which brings the no-Binaryen
  bundle down to roughly 8.5 MB before native runtime embedding.

### Breaking: `compile()` API is now async (#1757)

- The public compiler entry points — `compile`, `compileMulti`, `compileFiles`,
  `compileToWat`, `compileProject`, and `createIncrementalCompiler().compile`
  (plus the lower-level `compileSource` / `compileMultiSource` /
  `compileFilesSource`) — now return a `Promise`. **Every caller must `await`
  them.** A synchronous `compileSourceSync` (no Binaryen optimization) is
  retained for the few contexts that cannot await (the `eval` host shim).
- **Why:** the optional Binaryen optimizer now loads via
  `await import("binaryen")` instead of a synchronous `require`. Binaryen ships
  a top-level `await` that a sync `require` cannot load, which is what blocked
  embedding it in a `bun build --compile` / `deno compile` standalone binary
  (GH #986). With the async path the optimizer is bundled and the single-file
  binary runs `--optimize` with Binaryen embedded — no `wasm-opt` on `PATH`
  required. Follow-up to the #1756 `createRequire` stopgap.

  Migration: `const r = compile(src)` → `const r = await compile(src)`.

### Repository rename

- The repo has been renamed `loopdive/js2wasm` → `loopdive/js2`.
  GitHub provides a permanent redirect for the old URL, so existing
  clones and PR links continue to work. New clones and CI should use
  the new name. The `loopdive/js2wasm-baselines` baselines repo is
  tracked separately and will be renamed in a follow-up.

## Historical sprint tags

This file records the historical sprint boundary tags created from the sprint history in `plan/sprints/` and the Git history on `main`.

Tagging method:

- Use an explicit sprint-closing commit when one exists, for example `sprint-31 suspend`.
- Otherwise use the closest `main` snapshot that matches the documented sprint boundary and/or the archived `test262` run for that sprint.
- `sprint/32`, `sprint/34`, and `sprint/35` were not tagged because their sprint docs are still planning or incomplete.
- `sprint/33` does not exist in the current sprint history.

## Current test262 status

Latest complete archived full-suite entry: `20260331-215747` from [benchmarks/results/runs/index.json](/Users/thomas/Documents/Arbeit/Startup/Projekte/Mosaic/code/@loopdive/ts2wasm/benchmarks/results/runs/index.json)

- Pass rate: `15,155 / 48,174` = `31.5%`
- Previous full-suite entry: `15,246 / 48,174` = `31.7%`
- Note: [benchmarks/results/test262-report.json](/Users/thomas/Documents/Arbeit/Startup/Projekte/Mosaic/code/@loopdive/ts2wasm/benchmarks/results/test262-report.json) currently points to a missing target, so the pass rate above is sourced from the run index rather than the symlink.

## Sprint history

## Sprint 0 - v0.0.0

- Tags: `sprint/0`, `v0.0.0`
- Date range: 2026-02-27 to 2026-03-10
- Goal: Build the compiler, runtime, playground, and first conformance baseline before structured sprint tracking began.
- Worked on: Turned the initial prototype into a real TypeScript-to-Wasm toolchain: core AOT compilation, CLI and playground, import resolution and stdlib growth, classes/closures/async-await/destructuring, relocatable object emission and multi-memory linking, linear-memory backend work, fast mode, native strings and arrays, gradual typing, npm/package resolution, SIMD and benchmark infrastructure, and the first serious test262 subset runs that reached the 550-pass baseline used by Sprint 1.
- Baseline: project bootstrap / no recorded sprint baseline
- Final result: pre-Sprint-1 baseline established at `550` test262 passes
- test262: `550` pass (100% of compilable tests at that point)

## Sprint 52 - v0.52.0

- Tags: `sprint/52`, `v0.52.0`
- Date range: 2026-05-20
- Goal: Spec-completeness continuation + host platform imports — spec gap fixes, WASI extensions, Node.js/browser host imports, method closure caching, builtin subclassing
- Baseline: 22,412 pass / 43,160 total (51.9%) at v0.41.0
- Final result: 28,171 pass / 43,160 total (65.3%)
- test262: `28,171 / 43,160`
- Delta: +5,759 pass from v0.41.0 baseline (+25.7 pp)

### Highlights

- **Node.js host imports**: `fs.readFileSync`/`writeFileSync`/`existsSync` (gated behind `--allow-fs`), `crypto.randomBytes`/`randomUUID`, `console.error`/`warn` stderr routing, `process.argv`/`env`/`cwd`/`exit`, `__dirname`/`__filename`/`import.meta.url`
- **Browser host imports**: `fetch`, `setTimeout`/`setInterval`/`clearTimeout`, `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`, `crypto.getRandomValues`, export return-type interop
- **WASI extensions**: stdin via `fd_read`, console stderr via `fd_write`, `environ_get`/`environ_sizes_get`, `clock_time_get`, async stubs
- **Builtin subclassing**: `instanceof Sub` and `instanceof Parent` both true for `class Sub extends Map/Float32Array/WeakRef/Set` (tag-chain runtime approach)
- **Method closure caching**: fixes repeated `obj.method` creating new function objects each time
- **Spec gap fixes**: assignment-operator destructuring completion, rest-parameter destructuring, `ToNumber`/`ToNumeric` coercion, named-evaluation destructuring defaults, for-loop per-iteration let binding, iterator protocol destructuring close, private reference readonly TypeError, `Object.defineProperty` descriptor fidelity, `Array.prototype` generic arraylike, `Promise` combinators, generator prototype, `Array.fromAsync`, and 30+ more
- **Test262 CI**: 3× speedup via cross-PR baseline cache and per-scope test filter; sharded run time ~8 min
- **ESLint valid-wasm plugin**: `@loopdive/eslint-plugin-js2` package entries fixed
