# #2946 — promote-baseline push race: retries rebase wholesale-regenerated JSONLs and always conflict

## Problem

The `promote merged report to main baseline` job (test262-sharded.yml) pushes
the refreshed baseline files to `loopdive/js2wasm-baselines` with a
fetch→rebase→push retry loop (5 attempts). When **another** main run's promote
lands between this job's checkout and its push, every retry fails identically:
the baseline files (`test262-current.jsonl`, `test262-standalone-current.jsonl`,
the report/summary JSONs) are **wholesale-regenerated every run**, so rebasing
one refresh commit onto another is a guaranteed whole-file content conflict.
The loop exists for a transient race, but this race is not transient — the
loser can never win by retrying a rebase. Result:
`##[error]Failed to push baselines after 5 attempts (persistent, not a
transient race).`

## Evidence (2026-07-02, push:main runs during the #2424 landing window)

Main advanced 4 times in ~22 minutes (00:56, 01:05, 01:12, 01:19 + 01:27);
the shard matrix takes ~15–20 min, so promote jobs overlap heavily:

| Run                 | Main SHA | promote-baseline | Cause                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 28558202948 (#2424) | 9d37728  | **failure**      | lost race; 5/5 rebase attempts conflicted on all 8 baseline files applying its refresh commit `cdd5dd5` |
| 28558439826 (#2444) | dacd7fd  | success          | won its race window; pushed `71d3569` on attempt 1                                                      |
| 28558701658 (#2443) | a14faa4  | **failure**      | same conflict signature, 5/5 attempts                                                                   |

Consequence in that window: the honest post-#2424 re-seed only happened
because the _next_ run (#2444) won — the run that carried the intentional
re-baseline itself never promoted, and #2443's results were never promoted at
all. Under sustained merge-queue throughput roughly **every overlapping run's
promote is a coin flip**, so the rolling baseline skips main states
non-deterministically (staleness the #1668 stale-baseline guard only catches
past its threshold).

## Fix direction

The refresh commit's content is a pure function of the run's merged reports —
history does not need to be merged, only _replaced newest-wins per main
generation_:

1. **Stop rebasing content; regenerate or overwrite instead.** On push
   rejection: `git fetch` + `git reset --hard origin/main` + re-copy this
   run's already-built baseline files + commit + push. Retries then always
   converge (last writer wins the whole file set, which is the correct
   semantic for a wholesale snapshot).
2. **Guard ordering, not content**: before overwriting, compare the _main
   commit generation_ embedded in the baseline commit message (or a
   `baseline_sha` field): if the remote HEAD's source main SHA is a
   **descendant** of this run's main SHA, the remote is newer — skip the push
   and exit 0 (this run's snapshot is obsolete, which is fine). If it is an
   ancestor, overwrite. This makes the race benign in both directions and
   removes the false-failure noise.
3. Optional hardening: GitHub Actions `concurrency` group on the promote job
   (`concurrency: baselines-promote`, `cancel-in-progress: false`) to
   serialize promotes so the race window mostly disappears; keep 1+2 as the
   correctness backstop.

## Acceptance

- Two overlapping push:main runs both finish promote-baseline green; the
  baselines repo ends at the newer run's snapshot.
- An out-of-order finisher (older main SHA finishing last) does NOT clobber a
  newer baseline (ancestor/descendant check) and does NOT fail the job.
- No `Failed to push baselines after 5 attempts` occurrences under normal
  queue throughput.

## Context

Filed from the #2920/#2424 revert verification (task #2, dev-2912f): the
re-seed-before-revert ordering requirement was only satisfied by the _next_
run's promote winning its race. See the "Revert record" section in
`plan/issues/2920-strict-negative-verdict-succeeded-arm.md`.

## Resolution (2026-07-02) — DUPLICATE, already fixed by #2942 / PR #2456

I checked this against current `origin/main`'s `.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml`
before implementing anything, and the exact fix this issue prescribes is
**already live** — landed by **#2942 (PR #2456, commit `d35a13cbb`, dev-f2)**
at 2026-07-02 04:33, which superseded the old `#1861` fetch+rebase loop:

- **Stop rebasing content → hard-reset + overwrite (Option-A re-anchor):**
  `test262-sharded.yml` lines ~1663-1698 — on push rejection it re-fetches,
  `git checkout -f -B "$BR" origin/$BR`, re-applies this run's snapshotted
  baseline files wholesale, re-commits, retries (8 attempts, which now
  *converge* because last-writer-wins on a whole-file snapshot). This is
  Fix-direction §1 verbatim.
- **Ancestor/descendant ordering guard by main-SHA generation:** lines
  ~1671-1683 — parses the promoted main SHA out of the remote tip's commit
  subject and, if OUR `github.sha` is an ancestor of it, treats this promote as
  **superseded and drops it (exit success)** instead of clobbering the newer
  baseline. This is Fix-direction §2 verbatim.
- The louder stranding signal (`::error::Failed to push baselines after 8
  re-anchor attempts … See #2942`, line ~1700) is also present.
- Fix-direction §3 (job-level `concurrency` group) was **deliberately declined**
  by #2942 (code comment lines ~1645-1648: the per-SHA push groups are
  load-bearing, #2178) — not a gap.

Both acceptance criteria are satisfied by #2942: overlapping runs both finish
green (re-anchor converges), and an out-of-order older finisher no longer
clobbers a newer baseline (the ancestry guard drops it). This issue's evidence
(the #2424 landing window, 00:56-01:27) **predates** #2942 landing (04:33) and
was filed as an independent rediscovery of the same race without
cross-referencing #2942. No residual bug — closing as a duplicate, no code
change. (dev opus-dev)
