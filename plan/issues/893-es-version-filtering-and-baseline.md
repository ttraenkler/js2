# #893 — ES version filtering and Baseline compatibility mode for test262

## Status: open

## Problem

Current test262 runs count ALL tests including Stage 3 proposals (Temporal, source phase imports, import defer, etc.) and future features. This inflates the total and deflates the pass rate. We need:

1. **ES standard filtering** — only run tests for a specific ECMAScript edition (e.g., ES2024, ES2020, ES2015)
2. **Exclude proposals** — default mode should exclude Stage 3/4 proposals not yet in the standard
3. **Baseline compatibility** — test against the [Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline) feature set (widely available across browsers)

## Background

test262 metadata includes:
- `features` array — e.g., `["Temporal", "Array.prototype.includes"]`
- `es5id` / `es6id` / `esid` — references to spec sections
- `flags` — e.g., `[module]`, `[async]`

Each feature maps to an ES version. Stage 3 proposals have feature flags like `Temporal`, `import-defer`, `source-phase-imports`.

Baseline features are those supported across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari as defined by [web-platform-dx/web-features](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features).

## Proposed design

### ES target mode
```bash
pnpm run test:262 -- --es-target ES2024    # Only ES2024 and earlier
pnpm run test:262 -- --es-target ES2020    # Only ES2020 and earlier
pnpm run test:262                           # Default: current standard (no proposals)
```

Implementation:
- Build a `FEATURE_TO_ES_VERSION` map (e.g., `"Array.prototype.includes"` → `"ES2016"`, `"async-functions"` → `"ES2017"`)
- In `shouldSkip()`, check if any test feature exceeds the target ES version → skip
- Stage 3 proposals get version `"proposal"` — skipped unless `--include-proposals` flag

### Baseline mode
```bash
pnpm run test:262 -- --baseline             # Only Baseline-widely-available features
pnpm run test:262 -- --baseline=newly       # Baseline newly available
```

Implementation:
- Build a `BASELINE_FEATURES` set from web-features data
- Map test262 feature flags to Baseline feature IDs
- Skip tests whose features aren't in the Baseline set

### Separate counts in report
The report should show:
- Total tests in selected scope
- Pass / fail / CE / skip within that scope
- Clearly label: "ES2024 compliance: X%" vs "Full test262: Y%"

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `--es-target ES2024` runs only tests for ES2024 and earlier features
- [ ] Default mode excludes Stage 3 proposals (Temporal, import-defer, etc.)
- [ ] `--es-target ES2015` runs only ES5/ES6 tests
- [ ] `--baseline` runs only Baseline-widely-available feature tests
- [ ] Report clearly labels which mode was used
- [ ] Feature-to-ES-version mapping covers all test262 feature flags
- [ ] Pass rate is meaningful: e.g., "ES2024 compliance: 45% (15,000 / 33,000)"
