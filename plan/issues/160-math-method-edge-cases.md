# #160 — Math method edge cases

## Problem
Math.pow tests were incorrectly skipped due to overly broad skip filters matching `===`/`!==` patterns inside error message string literals.

## Root cause
- The "string strict comparison outside assert" skip filter used `/['"].*!==/` which matched when `!==` appeared anywhere after a quote on the same line — including inside string literal error messages
- The "array index with string concat in loop" filter matched `+ "` patterns inside throw statement error messages

## Fix
- Strip string literal contents before checking for string comparison patterns
- Changed regex to `/['"]\s*!==/` (require `===`/`!==` adjacent to quote, not just anywhere after it)
- Strip throw statement lines before checking for array index + string concat patterns
- Allow tests with `+ ""` value-to-string coercion through the filter (since string !== "literal" is now handled by the compiler)

## Tests unblocked
- 10 Math.pow tests (`applying-the-exp-operator_A2/A3/A5/A10/A11/A13/A14/A18/A21/A22`)
- All pass with 0 failures

## Status: Done
