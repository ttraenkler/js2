# #914 -- Add a short compiler architecture overview for contributors

## Problem

The project has a strong thesis and lots of active development, but there is no concise contributor-facing architecture map that answers:

- what the compiler pipeline is
- what each top-level source folder owns
- where to add support for a new syntax feature
- where runtime imports and post-passes live

Without that map, newcomers must reverse-engineer the project structure from very large files.

## Goal

Create a short architecture guide that makes the codebase feel legible and intentional to outside collaborators.

## Requirements

1. Explain the end-to-end pipeline in a single page:
   - parse/check
   - collect
   - codegen
   - emit
   - optimize
   - link
2. Describe what each major top-level folder owns
3. Include “where do I add X?” guidance for common change types
4. Keep the document short and operational, not aspirational
5. Link it from the README and contributor docs

## Acceptance criteria

- a new contributor can understand the compiler pipeline without reading the main backend files
- the architecture guide is linked from contributor-facing entry points
- file ownership becomes explicit rather than implied
