# #1078 — Emergency baseline refresh workflow_dispatch

## Problem

`allow_regressions` workflow_dispatch input was ambiguous, easy to miss,
and left no audit trail distinguishing forced refreshes from normal runs.

## Implementation

PR #14 (2026-04-24) in `.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml`:

1. Renamed `allow_regressions` → `force_baseline_refresh` with description
   making intent explicit in the Actions UI.
2. Added `confirm_force` input — must be typed as `"YES"` exactly to activate
   the force path. Prevents accidental one-click runs.
3. Updated `regression-gate` "Fail on regressions" condition:
   ```yaml
   if: steps.regression_diff.outputs.regressions == 'true' &&
       !(github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' &&
         inputs.force_baseline_refresh == true &&
         inputs.confirm_force == 'YES')
   ```
4. Added audit `::warning::` annotation in `promote-baseline` identifying
   the actor and pass/total when force path is used.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `force_baseline_refresh=true` + `confirm_force=YES` promotes regardless of regressions
- [x] `force_baseline_refresh=true` without confirmation has no effect (gate still fires)
- [x] Audit warning includes actor name and pass/total
- [x] Normal PR and push runs unaffected
