# #912 -- Remove circular dependencies from the core codegen backend

## Problem

The current backend has direct dependency cycles among the main codegen files, especially around:

- `index.ts`
- `expressions.ts`
- `statements.ts`

This makes the project feel fragile:

- import order matters more than it should
- files act as global utility bags
- it is hard to know which layer owns a helper
- contributors cannot safely move code without understanding several intertwined modules first

## Goal

Restructure the backend around stable dependency directions instead of cyclical coupling.

## Requirements

1. Define lower-level ownership boundaries for:
   - context/types
   - registries
   - shared helper utilities
   - expression lowering
   - statement lowering
2. Ensure expression and statement modules depend on shared low-level services instead of importing each other’s broad public surfaces
3. Keep any unavoidable cross-calls narrow and explicit
4. Add regression tests if refactoring affects codegen order or initialization behavior
5. Document the intended dependency direction in a short architecture note or module comments

## Acceptance criteria

- the core backend no longer relies on broad circular imports between its main modules
- helper ownership is clearer
- future file splits can happen without reintroducing the same dependency knot

## Implementation Summary

**Approach:** Extended the `shared.ts` delegate pattern to break all core cycles. Added 10+ new late-bound delegates; each implementation module calls `registerXxx(impl)` at module scope, so registrations fire before any compilation call.

**Cycle reduction:** 53 cycles → 6 cycles (all remaining in feature layer — binary-ops↔assignment, closures/literals/statements triangle; none in core index.ts/expressions.ts/statements.ts).

**Key changes:**
- `shared.ts`: Added delegates for `compileStatement`, `compileStringLiteral`, `compileSuperPropertyAccess/ElementAccess`, `ensureAnyHelpers`, `resolveComputedKeyExpression`, `ensureBindingLocals`, `hoistFunctionDeclarations`, `emitDefaultValueCheck`, `emitArgumentsObject`, `emitBoundsCheckedArrayGet`, `resolveEnclosingClassName`, `coerceType`, `ensureLateImport/flushLateImportShifts`. Added `isAnyValue` as a direct function.
- `property-access.ts`: Removed import from `expressions.ts`; now imports from sub-modules (shared.ts, expressions/extern.ts, expressions/late-imports.ts). Hosts `resolveStructName`, `isGeneratorIteratorResultLike`, `getIteratorResultValueType` (moved from misc.ts). Inlines `getWellKnownSymbolId` to avoid literals.ts cycle.
- `expressions/misc.ts`: Removed the 3 moved functions; re-exports them from property-access.ts for backward compatibility.
- `string-ops.ts`: Stopped importing from `expressions.ts`; uses binary-ops.ts, expressions/helpers.ts, property-access.ts directly. Registers `compileStringLiteral` delegate.
- `expressions/new-super.ts`: Registers `compileSuperPropertyAccess/ElementAccess` delegates.
- `index.ts`, `statements.ts`, all `statements/` sub-modules: Import from `shared.ts` and direct sub-modules instead of broad `expressions.ts`/`statements.ts` barrels.
- Fixed two pre-existing bugs: `emitBoundsCheckedArrayGet` and `resolveEnclosingClassName` delegate stubs were never registered — now registered in `array-methods.ts` and `expressions/new-super.ts`.
- Architecture note added to `shared.ts` module docblock describing the intended dependency direction DAG.

**Architecture principle:** `shared.ts` has no deps on main modules. `registry/*.ts` and `context/*.ts` are pure low-level. Feature modules (expressions/, statements/, closures, etc.) import from shared and registry — not from each other's broad surfaces.

## Test Results

Scoped equivalence tests run before and after the fix — same pass/fail counts in both worktree and main workspace (pre-existing failures are identical). No regressions.

`npx madge --circular` baseline: 53 cycles.
After fix: 6 cycles (all in feature layer).
`tsc --noEmit`: clean.
