# Issue #316: Runtime failure -- array element access out of bounds

## Status: done

## Summary
1 test fails with "RuntimeError: array element access out of bounds". An array access uses an index that exceeds the array length. The codegen needs bounds checking or the test has an edge case with sparse arrays or array growth.

## Category
Sprint 5 / Group B

## Complexity: XS

## Scope
- Analyze the specific failing test to identify the out-of-bounds pattern
- Add bounds checking for array element access where needed
- Handle sparse array patterns or dynamic array growth

## Acceptance criteria
- The array out of bounds runtime failure resolved

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added bounds checking to `compileElementAccess` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`. Two new helper functions were introduced:

- `emitBoundsCheckedArrayGet(fctx, arrTypeIdx, elementType)`: Emits Wasm instructions that save the array ref and index to locals, perform an unsigned less-than check (`i32.lt_u`) against `array.len`, and use an `if/else` block to either do the `array.get` (in bounds) or return a type-appropriate default value (out of bounds).
- `defaultValueInstrs(vt)`: Returns default value instructions for any ValType (NaN for f64, 0 for i32/i64, ref.null for reference types, etc.)

The unsigned comparison trick (`i32.lt_u`) handles both negative indices (which wrap to large unsigned values) and indices >= array length in a single comparison.

Both array access paths are now bounds-checked:
1. Vec struct access (struct with length + backing array)
2. Raw array access

### What worked
- The unsigned comparison approach cleanly handles both negative and too-large indices
- Returns JS-semantics-correct `undefined` equivalent (NaN for f64 arrays)

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: Added `emitBoundsCheckedArrayGet` and `defaultValueInstrs` helpers; modified both array.get call sites in `compileElementAccess`

### Tests
- E2E verified: in-bounds access returns correct values, out-of-bounds returns NaN, negative index returns NaN
- Array capacity tests pass (push 10k, pop, shift operations)
