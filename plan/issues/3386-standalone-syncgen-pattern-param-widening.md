# #3386 — sync-generator pattern params: widen the native admission

## Problem

Since #2961, a standalone compile that emits the `env::__gen_*` family is a
hard `compile_error` (`error_category: host_import_leak`). The single largest
SYNC-generator residual cohort is **generators with destructuring-pattern
params**, measured 2026-07-17 from the promoted
`test262-standalone-current.jsonl` (official scope):

Dominant import combo:
`__create_generator,__gen_create_buffer,__gen_next[,__gen_return,__gen_result_*],__get_caught_exception`.

## Live probes (2026-07-17, current main, `--target standalone`)

| probe                                                               | result    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `function* f([x, y]) {}` at module scope                            | HOST-FREE |
| `function* f([x = 1]) {}` at module scope                           | HOST-FREE |
| same decl WRAPPED in the test262 `export function test(){}` wrapper | **LEAKS** |
| `class C { *method([x, y]) {} }` (even module scope, plain pattern) | **LEAKS** |
| `var f = function*([x = 1]) {}`                                     | **LEAKS** |
| `{ *method([x]) {} }` object literal                                | **LEAKS** |
| wrapped `function* g() { yield 1; }` (no pattern)                   | HOST-FREE |

So sync-gen NESTING itself is solved (#3302/#3032 W3/W4); the bails are all in
the pattern-param admission.

## Root cause (exact gates, verified on current main)

All in `src/codegen/generators-native.ts`:

1. **Fn-expression gate is identifier-only** — `isNativeGeneratorExpressionShape`
   (line 1454; the identifier check at line 1457: `if (!ts.isIdentifier(param.name)) return false;`).
   #3164 shipped fn-exprs but never extended them to the #2920 pattern-param
   lowering. This alone bails all 174 `expressions/generators/dstr` rows and the
   fn-expr-shaped harness templates.
2. **Element defaults bail** — plan builder at lines ~1274–1281: any
   `el.initializer` (`[x = 23]`, `{a: b = expr}`) returns `null` ("throwing /
   function-valued default produced invalid modules"). This bails every
   `dflt-*` file (87×2 decl rows + the method `gen-meth-dflt-*` families).
3. **Untyped ARRAY patterns bail** — lines ~1282–1305: array patterns require a
   syntactic `param.type` resolving to a concrete vec/tuple ref. Test262 is
   plain JS — **no param is ever TS-annotated**, so every array-pattern param in
   the corpus bails. (Object patterns are admitted untyped; that is why
   `obj-ptrn-id-init-skipped.js` passes host-free.) This is what bails the
   plain-pattern class-method probe above.
4. **Whole-param defaults, nested sub-patterns, rest elements bail** — lines
   ~1250–1273 (`param.initializer`, non-identifier elements, `dotDotDotToken`).
5. Object-literal methods with param defaults/optionals bail separately
   (lines ~1736–1744, the `__argc_default` trampoline gap, #2581) — keep that
   bail; it is NOT this issue's scope to fix the trampoline.

## Implementation Plan

Waves, each independently landable and measure-first (sample by CONSTRUCT):

### W1 — fn-expression pattern params (cheap, unlocks ~174+ rows)

**File: `src/codegen/generators-native.ts`**, `isNativeGeneratorExpressionShape`
(line 1454). Replace the `!ts.isIdentifier(param.name)` bail with the SAME
param acceptance the plan builder applies (identifier | ArrayBindingPattern |
ObjectBindingPattern, no rest) — i.e. delegate the pattern legality entirely to
`buildNativeGeneratorPlan` (which `isNativeGeneratorCandidate` already calls
last). Check the #3164 emit site in `closures.ts` (the lifted-closure factory
registration) threads the raw pattern arg into the state struct the same way
the free-function path does (`emitPatternParamDestructure` +
`collectPatternBindingIdentifiers`, both already exported in
generators-native.ts). The single-candidate-gate discipline (#3164 comment at
line ~1685) means NO separate mirror edit is needed in
`sourceNeedsGeneratorHostImports` — but verify with a leak probe on
`var f = function*([x]) {}` in both lanes.

### W2 — array-pattern params via the native ITERATOR protocol (the big lever)

The `param.type`-required vec-indexing destructure is both too narrow AND
spec-divergent: §14.3.3 array destructuring goes through the iterator protocol
(the corpus tests exactly that — `ary-ptrn-elem-id-iter-done`,
`iter-step-err`, `iter-val-*`). Replace the state-0 resume-prelude destructure
for array patterns with the SAME native `__iterator` /
IteratorBindingInitialization lowering that ordinary (non-generator) function
params and for-of heads already use host-free (see `iterator-native.ts` and
`destructuring-params.ts` — find the non-generator array-pattern param path and
reuse its emitters; do NOT build a parallel destructure). Then drop the
`param.type` requirement (lines ~1282–1305) — the raw arg is stored externref
in the state struct and iterated in the prelude, so the concrete-vec typing
question disappears.

- Edge cases: iterator `done` before pattern exhausted → remaining bindings
  `undefined`; abrupt `next()` → the error must propagate out of the FIRST
  `.next()` call on the generator (the prelude runs at state 0, i.e. first
  resume — matches §27.5.3.1 lazy semantics); elision holes advance the
  iterator without binding; IteratorClose on early abrupt completion.
- The eager host path snapshots by-value at CREATION — the native prelude runs
  at first `.next()`. That is a semantic FIX (lazy per spec), but re-run the
  construct sample in the JS-HOST lane too: host lane must stay byte-identical
  (the gate change is inside plan admission consumed identically by both — the
  host lane's own candidate arm at line 1651 restricts to fn decls with
  try-across-yield, so host-lane emission does not change; verify with
  SHA-equal probe).

### W3 — element defaults in the resume-prelude destructure

Lines ~1274–1281. After W2, a defaulted element lowers as: bind from iterator
step; `if (value === undefined) value = <initializer>`. Initializers evaluate
in the RESUME function scope — they may reference earlier pattern bindings
(already spilled), module globals, and captured boxes (#3302 slots). First
root-cause the recorded "#2920 invalid modules on throwing/function-valued
defaults" (likely: the initializer expression compiled against the OUTER fctx
local table instead of the resume fctx — compile initializers with the resume
fctx, same as body statements). Whole-param defaults (`[x] = []`, line ~1257)
join here: evaluate the whole-param initializer when the raw arg field reads
undefined, BEFORE the iterator acquire.

### W4 — nested sub-patterns + rest elements

Nested patterns recurse the W2 lowering (each sub-pattern gets its own
iterator/property extraction). Array rest (`[a, ...rest]`) drains the iterator
into a native vec (host-free — the `__iterator` loop); object rest still needs
`__extern_rest_object` — keep object-rest bailed (correct-or-legacy) and note
the residual count.

### Excluded / guarded

- The 16 `*-ary-ptrn-elem-ary-elision-iter` private-gen files guarded on #3312
  (shadowed-binding capture promotion) stay excluded until #3312 lands.
- Object-literal method param DEFAULTS keep the #2581 `__argc_default` bail.

## Test plan

- Leak probes per wave (compile → import set empty + `WebAssembly.instantiate(binary, {})` succeeds).
- Construct-sampled corpus flip on `class/dstr` + `generators/dstr` +
  `object/dstr` (never directory-sampled — #2938 lesson).
- Equivalence tests: add `tests/issue-3386.test.ts` with wrapped-shape probes
  (the wrapper is load-bearing — module-scope-only probes gave false greens
  during decomposition).
- JS-host lane byte-identity (SHA-equal) on modules without the construct AND
  on host-lane generator modules (the host candidate arm must not widen).

## Regression risks

- Gate/registration lockstep: `isNativeGeneratorCandidate` ==
  `sourceNeedsGeneratorHostImports` == the emit sites (class-bodies.ts:~2354
  region, literals.ts, closures.ts) must agree per-decl or the module bakes an
  undefined `__gen_*` funcIdx (invalid wasm). Every wave: run the async/gen
  corpus compile-validity scan (0 invalid wasm).
- The wrapped-vs-module-scope delta above means ALL probes must use the test262
  wrapper shape.

## Implementation record (fable-dev-4, 2026-07-18)

### Key design decision — EAGER (call-time) destructure, not resume-prelude

The architect plan (W2/W3) proposed re-destructuring pattern params inside the
resume function's **state-0 prelude**. I did **not** do that — it is both a
spec-TIMING bug and a double-drive hazard. §10.2.11
FunctionDeclarationInstantiation (step 23-25 → IteratorBindingInitialization)
runs parameter destructuring at **CALL time**, for generators too. The test262
`dstr` templates prove it: `assert.throws(Test262Error, function () { f(g); })`
with **no `.next()`** — the iterator's poisoned `.next()`/`value` getter must
throw at `f(g)`. A resume-prelude destructure fires at first `.next()` (wrong),
and now that untyped array patterns go through the iterator protocol it would
also drive a one-shot iterator twice.

**What I did instead:** every native-generator emit site ALREADY destructures
pattern params into factory locals BEFORE the factory emit (function-body.ts,
class-bodies.ts, literals.ts, closures.ts, nested-declarations.ts) using the
ordinary corpus-proven emitters (`destructureParamArray/Object` → standalone-
native `__array_from_iter_n`, null guards, elision, defaults). I made
`compileNativeGeneratorFunction` **pack those bound factory locals into the
generator state-struct spill fields** at `struct.new`, and the resume function
reads them back through the ordinary spill-load loop. The old state-0
re-destructure is deleted. This reuses ALL existing destructure semantics for
free and gets call-time timing correct by construction.

### Files / functions touched

- `src/codegen/generators-native.ts`:
  - `buildNativeGeneratorPlan` param loop — replaced the #2920 conservative gate
    (typed-array-only, no element defaults) with: admit array/object patterns,
    nested sub-patterns, element defaults; spill-type each bound name via
    `resolveBindingElementType` (incl. #3315 undef-widening); bail rest elements
    and **function/arrow/class-valued element defaults** (`[g = function(){}]`
    → illegal cast in the class-method lane, the #3164 host-mix fixture).
  - `NativeGeneratorPlan` + `NativeGeneratorInfo` (context/types.ts) — new
    `patternParamBindings` / `undefWidenedPatternBindings` sets.
  - `compileNativeGeneratorFunction` — pack pattern-bound factory locals into
    spill fields (coerce when lane-local type != spill type; pure ref→ref_null
    widen is free) instead of the inert default.
  - `ensureNativeGeneratorResumeFunction` — removed the state-0 prelude
    re-destructure; mark undef-widened pattern bindings in the resume fctx.
  - `isNativeGeneratorExpressionShape` — admit binding-pattern fn-expr params.
  - Dropped now-unused imports (`destructureParam*`,
    `collectPatternBindingIdentifiers`); added `resolveBindingElementType`,
    `isUndefWidenedBindingElement`.
- `tests/issue-3386.test.ts` — 17 cases incl. spec-timing (throws at call, body
  lazy) + the function-valued-default exclusion.
- NOTE: I did **NOT** need the class-bodies.ts COLLECTION-phase binding-pattern
  widen after all — an earlier attempt at it regressed the non-generator
  class-method baseline, and origin/main advanced (post-#3311/#3312 merge) so the
  class array-pattern lane now agrees between collection and emit without it.
  Left class-bodies.ts untouched.

### Done vs remaining

- [x] W1 fn-expression pattern params (host-free + correct)
- [x] W2 untyped array patterns via native iterator protocol (call-time)
- [x] W3 element defaults (numeric / object / call-expr incl. throwing)
- [x] W4 nested sub-patterns
- [x] whole-param defaults (`[x,y] = [..]`)
- [x] spec timing: destructure at CALL, body lazy at first `.next()`
- [x] class instance/static + object-literal + free-fn + fn-expr lanes
- [ ] rest ELEMENTS (`[a, ...r]` / `{a, ...r}`) — bail (rest local type minted
      inside destructure helpers, not via `resolveBindingElementType`; spill
      typing not reconciled). Follow-up slice.
- [ ] FUNCTION/arrow/class-valued element defaults — bail (closure-valued spill
      round-trip → illegal cast in class-method lane). Follow-up slice.
- [ ] object-literal method param defaults/optionals — keep the #2581
      `__argc_default` bail (out of scope, unchanged).

### Known pre-existing (NOT introduced here)

`tests/generator-yield-contexts.test.ts > "yield in a generator function
expression"` fails on clean origin/main too (host-lane lazy-thunk needs
setExports wiring — #3032-adjacent). Verified by resetting the 3 source files to
origin/main and re-running. Unrelated to #3386.
