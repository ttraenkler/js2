# #502 — Quick wins: narrow stale skip filters (~1,160 tests)

## Status: open

Three skip filters are stale and should be narrowed or removed. No compiler changes needed — just filter adjustments in `test262-runner.ts`.

### 1. Symbol filter → only skip Symbol-as-property-key (207 tests from #483)
Currently skips ALL tests mentioning `Symbol`. After #471 (basic Symbol as i32), tests that just call `Symbol()` and compare identity should pass. Only skip tests that use Symbol as a property key (`obj[sym]`, `{[sym]: val}`).

### 2. Unary +/- on null/undefined → remove (480 tests from #491)
#348 fixed null/undefined arithmetic. This filter is stale.

### 3. Object.keys, new Object, globalThis, for-of destr. → remove (194 tests from #494)
These features were implemented in #61, #181, etc. Filters are stale.

### 4. Cross-realm → remove (33 tests from #500)
Single-module Wasm has no cross-realm issues. Tests should pass trivially.

## Expected result
~914 tests unskipped. Many will pass immediately, others will fail/CE and get triaged into existing issues.

## Complexity: S
