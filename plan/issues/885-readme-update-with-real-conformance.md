# #885 -- README update for STF application

## Problem

README has outdated conformance numbers and lacks the comparison table and architecture overview needed for funding applications.

## Requirements

1. **Conformance section**: Update with real number (17,252 / 35.9%), methodology (test262, cache-disabled, isolated worktree)
2. **Comparison table**: Move the table from blog/ai-agent-team-workflow.md into README — shows js2wasm vs Javy, Porffor, JAWSM, etc.
3. **Architecture diagram**: Simple text/mermaid diagram showing TypeScript → tsc parser → codegen → Wasm IR → emitter → .wasm
4. **Key differentiators**: WasmGC (no runtime), standalone WASI mode, dual-mode (JS host optional), AI agent team workflow
5. **Getting started**: Quick example (compile a function, run it)
6. **Roadmap**: Link to sprint plans and dependency graph

## Acceptance criteria

- README has current conformance number
- Comparison table with 8+ projects
- Architecture section with diagram
- "Why js2wasm" section highlighting sovereign tech aspects (no vendor lock-in, standalone, open source)
