# #930 -- Not-a-constructor detection (68 FAIL)

## Problem

68 tests verify that calling `new` on non-constructor functions throws TypeError. Currently the compiler allows `new Array.prototype.forEach()` and similar calls to succeed (or crash) instead of throwing TypeError.

## Error pattern

```
returned 3 — assert #2 at L30: assert.throws(TypeError, () => { new Array.prototype.copyWithin(); });
returned 3 — assert #2 at L30: assert.throws(TypeError, () => { new Array.prototype.toLocaleString(); });
```

The test has 2+ assertions. The first (assert #1) passes, but assert #2 — which checks `new X()` throws — fails.

## Sample test files

- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/copyWithin/not-a-constructor.js`
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/toLocaleString/not-a-constructor.js`
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/forEach/not-a-constructor.js`
- Most are `test/built-ins/*/not-a-constructor.js`

## Root cause

Built-in methods like `Array.prototype.forEach` are not constructors — `[[Construct]]` is not defined for them. JavaScript's `new` operator must check `[[Construct]]` and throw TypeError if absent. Our compiled code either:
1. Doesn't check the `[[Construct]]` internal slot before calling
2. Treats all function references as constructable

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] >=55 of 68 not-a-constructor tests pass
- [ ] `new` on non-constructor host functions throws TypeError
- [ ] No regression in existing PASS tests

## Notes

This is a sub-pattern of #846 (built-in methods accepting invalid arguments). The fix likely involves checking a "constructable" flag on function objects before allowing `new`.

## Implementation

In `compileNewExpression` (`src/codegen/expressions.ts`, line ~15242), added two detection patterns before the Promise handler:

**Pattern 1**: `X.prototype.Y` — if the new expression accesses a property on `X.prototype` (where X is any expression), emit TypeError throw immediately. This catches ES2022 methods (forEach, map) AND ES2023 methods (with, toSorted, findLast) that resolve to `any` in ES2022 TypeScript lib.

**Pattern 2**: TypeScript type check — if TypeScript knows the expression has call signatures but no construct signatures (e.g. `Array.from`, `Math.abs`, `decodeURIComponent`), emit TypeError throw.

## Test Results

- 9 → 88 pass on 231 Array/String/Number/Math/Object not-a-constructor tests
- 0 equivalence test regressions (93 pre-existing failures on main, same count on branch)
- Issue-specific tests: 6/6 pass
