# #187 — String prototype methods: heavy test skipping due to include filters

## Status: in-review
## Summary
Most String prototype method test262 categories show 0 pass / 0 fail because nearly all tests are skipped. The skip reasons are primarily "unsupported include: propertyHelper.js" and "prototype chain not supported".

## Motivation
Current test262 results for String methods:
- charAt: 0 pass, 0 fail (25 skip)
- charCodeAt: 0 pass, 0 fail (25 skip)
- lastIndexOf: 0 pass, 0 fail (25 skip)
- includes: 0 pass, 0 fail (27 skip)
- startsWith: 0 pass, 0 fail (21 skip)
- endsWith: 0 pass, 0 fail (27 skip)
- slice: 0 pass, 0 fail (38 skip)
- substring: 0 pass, 0 fail (46 skip)
- trim/trimStart/trimEnd: 0 pass, 0 fail (175 skip combined)
- toLowerCase/toUpperCase: 0 pass, 0 fail (56 skip)
- split: 0 pass, 0 fail (120 skip)
- Only replace (15 pass) and indexOf (1 pass) have any passes

Many skipped tests only use `.prototype` in the test description/comments but not in actual test logic. The skip filter regex `\.prototype[\.\s=]` is too aggressive.

## Scope
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- shouldSkip() prototype filter refinement

## Complexity
S

## Implementation Notes
The fix strips comments and YAML metadata from the source before checking for `.prototype` patterns. This is done by applying three regex replacements in a local block:
1. Strip `/*--- ... ---*/` YAML metadata
2. Strip `// ...` single-line comments
3. Strip `/* ... */` multi-line comments

Only the resulting executable code is checked for `.prototype[.\s=]` or `__proto__`. This unblocks ~293 tests that were falsely skipped because `.prototype` only appeared in their info/description metadata (e.g., `info: String.prototype.charAt(pos)`).

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Prototype skip filter does not match `.prototype` in comments
- [x] Tests with `.prototype` in executable code are still correctly skipped
- [x] ~293 additional String prototype tests become runnable (may still be skipped by other filters)
