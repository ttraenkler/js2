# #811 — Extract fixup passes from index.ts → fixups.ts

## What moves

~800 lines — post-compilation fixup passes:

- `fixupStructNewArgCounts` (line 11429)
- `fixupStructNewResultCoercion` (line 11565, 275 lines)
- `fixupExternConvertAny` (line 11840)
- `fixupModuleGlobalIndices` (line 7927)
- `markLeafStructsFinal` (line 52)
- `repairStructTypeMismatches` (line 112)
- `repairBody` (line 131)
- `instrStackDelta` (line 307)

## Validation

1. `npm test` must pass
2. These are post-processing passes — compile any .ts file and verify binary output is identical
3. Bit-for-bit comparison: `sha256sum output.wasm` before and after refactor

## Risk: LOW

Pure post-processing. These functions take a completed WasmModule and fix it up. No interaction with compilation state. Clean extraction.

**Note:** dev-struct is currently working on `fixupStructNewResultCoercion` — coordinate timing.

## Complexity: S
