# #898 -- Extend compile-time TDZ elimination to loop-local accesses

## Problem

Issue `#800` already compiled away many runtime TDZ checks using static analysis, but it intentionally stayed conservative for loops and closures.

That leaves loop-heavy hot code still paying TDZ overhead even in cases where the compiler can prove the variable is initialized before every use inside the loop body.

Example symptom from the regressed `bench_array` WAT:

- extra locals such as `__tdz_arr`, `__tdz_i`, `__tdz_total`
- runtime TDZ bookkeeping retained even though the loop variables are initialized in straightforward local flow

This is likely one contributor to the benchmark regression and unnecessary code size/runtime overhead in tight loops.

## Background

Completed issue:

- [#800](/Users/thomas/Documents/Arbeit/Startup/Projekte/Mosaic/code/@loopdive/ts2wasm/plan/issues/sprints/0/800.md) — compile away TDZ checks with static analysis

Current behavior from `#800`:

1. Access after declaration in straight-line code → skip runtime check
2. Access before declaration in straight-line code → emit throw directly
3. Access in closure or loop → keep runtime flag check conservatively

The missing optimization is case 3 for loop-local situations that are still statically provable.

## Requirements

1. Extend TDZ static analysis to recognize loop-local accesses that are definitely after initialization
2. Eliminate runtime TDZ flag checks for provably safe loop-variable reads
3. Preserve runtime checks for genuinely ambiguous loop/control-flow cases
4. Do not regress TDZ correctness in `for`, `for-of`, `for-in`, `while`, or nested block scopes
5. Add tests covering both:
   - safe loop cases that should compile away TDZ checks
   - unsafe loop cases that must still throw or retain checks

## Acceptance criteria

- simple initialized loop-local accesses no longer emit `__tdz_*` locals or runtime TDZ checks when they are provably unnecessary
- ambiguous loop cases still preserve correct TDZ behavior
- generated WAT for hot loop benchmarks is smaller/cleaner in the proven-safe cases
- existing TDZ correctness tests continue to pass
