# #882 -- Test262 runner: sharded parallel execution with merged reports

## Outcome

This issue is complete in spirit, even though the final implementation differs
from the original "8 sequential local shards" sketch.

The repo now has a live sharded runner in
[test262-sharded.yml](../../../.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml):

- `16` parallel chunk jobs on GitHub Actions
- one existing `tests/test262-chunk*.test.ts` file per shard
- merged JSONL output and merged report generation
- regression comparison against `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl`
- baseline promotion on successful `main` runs

## Why this resolves the issue

The core goal of `#882` was to stop treating full test262 as one giant,
memory-growing monolith and to make it practical to run in parallel with
bounded shard scope. The current chunked CI implementation achieves that in a
cleaner way than the original local loop.

## Remaining work

The remaining runner cleanup is no longer "add sharding". It is tracked by the
follow-up timeout/reporting issues such as `#824` and `#991` to `#996`.

## Acceptance criteria

- sharded test262 runs exist and are used in CI
- shard outputs are merged into a single report/baseline
- runner no longer depends on a single monolithic full-suite process
