# #992 -- Iterator.prototype.take limit-less-than-total hits 30s compiler timeout

## Problem

The full official-scope recheck (`benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260407-005506.jsonl`)
contains a dedicated **30s compile timeout** for:

- `test/built-ins/Iterator/prototype/take/limit-less-than-total.js`

This is only one file, but it still costs a full **30s worker slot** on every
full run and sits in the same broader Iterator helper area as #991.

## Why this should be separate

The timeout is in `Iterator.prototype.take`, not the `generator-is-running`
cluster. It likely represents a different slow path:

- helper pipeline for bounded iteration
- array/result accumulation
- limit arithmetic / loop lowering

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§27.1.4.2 Iterator.prototype.take](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-iteratorprototype.take) — step 6: if remaining ≤ 0, return IteratorClose and complete


## Suggested fix

1. Reproduce the test in isolation
2. Compare generated helper/code size against other passing Iterator helper tests
3. Identify whether `take` lowers through a unique loop/closure path
4. Add a regression check so compile time stays below the timeout threshold

## Acceptance criteria

- `limit-less-than-total.js` compiles in <5s locally
- no `compile_timeout` for this test in a full recheck
