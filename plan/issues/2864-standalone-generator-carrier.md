# Standalone: Wasm-native generator carrier (sync)

## Problem

Sync generators (`function*`, generator methods, `yield`/`yield*`) work in
js-host via host imports but have **no general standalone carrier**. Only
"sequential numeric yields" are lowered natively (#680); anything else leaks
`__create_generator` / `__gen_create_buffer` / `__gen_next` / `__gen_yield_star`
/ `__gen_result_value` / `__gen_set_return` / `__gen_push_ref` / `__gen_push_f64`,
which under standalone either fail instantiation or hit the #680 refusal
(`src/codegen/function-body.ts:1020`).

### Impact (measured 2026-06-30) — ~697 standalone-only failures

Leaked imports across the gap: `__gen_create_buffer` 1,648, `__gen_next` 1,070,
`__create_generator` 748, `__gen_yield_star` 505 (these counts include the async
cases tracked in #2865). Manifests as `fail` (598) and CE (99); many proximate
errors are `illegal cast [in __obj_find() ← __extern_set]` inside the
destructuring/iterator machinery that the generator drives.

## Root cause

There is no Wasm-native coroutine/state-machine lowering for general generator
bodies in standalone. The host carrier buffers yields in a JS-side structure
(`__gen_*`). A standalone generator needs either:

1. a **resumable state-machine transform** (CPS / explicit state var + switch on
   re-entry, locals spilled to a heap frame struct), or
2. WasmGC **stack-switching** (the `stack-switching` proposal) if the target
   runtime enables it — but CLAUDE.md notes wasmtime rejects all-proposals; this
   is not portable yet.

Approach (1) is the portable path: lower a generator body to a `$GenFrame`
struct (captured locals + an i32 `state`), and a `next(frame, sentValue)`
function that `br_table`s on `state` to the resume point, runs to the next
`yield`, stores the next state, and returns `{value, done}`. `yield*` delegates
to the inner iterator's `next`.

## Implementation Plan

**Architecture-scale — tagged `architect_spec: candidate`.** Design needed
before coding. Key decisions for the architect:

- Frame representation: `struct $GenFrame (field $state (mut i32)) (field $localN (mut T))…`
  one field per live-across-yield local; reuse the ref-cell pattern for captures.
- State-machine transform location: in IR lowering (`src/ir/lower.ts`) vs the
  legacy codegen generator path (`src/codegen/function-body.ts`,
  `class-bodies.ts`, `closures.ts`). Prefer IR if generator nodes are adopted;
  else extend the #680 native path in function-body.ts:1020.
- `IteratorResult` representation: reuse the existing `{value, done}` $Object or
  a nominal struct; must satisfy the for-of / spread / destructuring consumers
  natively (overlaps #2863 `__array_from_iter_n` spread).
- `return()`/`throw()` completion (try/finally inside generators) → finally
  blocks must run on early completion; the state machine must encode finally
  regions.

Start scope: plain `function*` with value yields + `yield*` over an array /
another native generator. Defer `[Symbol.iterator]`-driven `yield*` over an
arbitrary host iterator until the iterator-protocol carrier is native.

## Test plan

Standalone fail/CE → pass:

- `test/language/expressions/yield/**`, `test/language/statements/generators/**`
- `test/built-ins/GeneratorFunction/**`, `test/built-ins/GeneratorPrototype/**`
- `test/built-ins/Iterator/prototype/{map,take,drop,flatMap}/**` (driven by gens)

Full `merge_group` + standalone high-water. This is the single largest lever
(sync 697 + async 986 = 1,683 combined with #2865). Sequence #2864 before #2865
(async generators build on this).

## F1 — heterogeneous (boxed-`any`) carrier (landed)

**Scope shipped:** object / mixed-type yields now lower to the Wasm-native
generator carrier host-free in standalone/WASI, via the dominant consumers:
`.next()` / `.next().value` (open dispatch), `for-of`, and array destructuring.
Verify-first (`function* g(){ yield {a:1}; yield 2 }` → `r1.value.a + r2.value`)
compiles with **zero host imports** and returns `3` (the yielded object survives
the frame). gc-mode unchanged; numeric / string carriers byte-for-byte unchanged.

### Why these decisions (root-cause, not symptom)

The resumable frame already existed — `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` is a
`br_table`-on-state-machine, but its `value`/`sent`/`abrupt`/spill slots were
f64-only (#1665) or a uniform native-string ref (#2171). `generatorElemValType`
returned `null` for object/mixed yields, which routed them to the eager-buffer
**host** path (`__gen_*` imports) — fatal under standalone. F1 generalises the
frame rather than building a new one.

- **Carrier = `externref`, not a bespoke tagged struct.** The `any` TS type
  already maps to `externref` (`type-mapper.ts`), and the boxing seams
  (`__box_number`, `extern.convert_any`) are **native defined funcs** under
  `target: standalone|wasi` (`addUnionImportsAsNativeFuncs`), so every JS value
  boxes to externref with NO host import. Using externref (over anyref) means a
  consumer reading `.value` / a for-of loop var as `any` needs no extra coercion
  — the carrier IS the `any` representation the rest of codegen agrees on.
- **`sent`/`abrupt` typed PER-CARRIER** (`genCarrierFieldType`): externref for
  the boxed-any carrier, f64 for numeric/string. The state struct is minted
  per-generator, so this keeps the numeric/string structs and all their call
  sites byte-identical — zero regression risk to the ~250 existing native-gen
  tests — while the any frame carries arbitrary `.next(v)`/`.return(v)` values.
- **Open dispatch (`buildNativeGeneratorDispatch`) was the load-bearing path.**
  `let it = g()` types `it` as `Generator<…>` → externref (the state struct is
  boxed), so `it.next()` routes through the open anyref dispatch, NOT the
  concrete-typed direct path. The dispatch keyed its enclosing block on the f64
  IteratorResult singleton and set one shared f64 `sent` across branches — it
  could not host a boxed-any branch (distinct result struct, externref sent). Fix
  is **gated on `hasAny`**: a module with no any-carrier generator keeps the
  exact f64-singleton dispatch (byte-identical); a module that has one switches
  the block type to `eqref` (common supertype of all result structs) and emits
  the `.next(v)` arg both as externref (any branches) and f64 (numeric branches,
  derived by one unbox so a side-effecting arg evals once). This confines all
  behavioural change to modules that actually use the new carrier.
- **Open result reader** (`tryCompileNativeGeneratorResultProperty`) now
  ref-tests EVERY distinct result struct (not just the f64 singleton): `.done`
  is uniformly i32; `.value` picks its return ValType from the **static** type of
  the `.value` property (number → f64 fast path preserved; object/any →
  externref). This is why numeric `.next().value` reads are unchanged.

### Deferred (follow-ups; all bail cleanly / are non-regressing today)

- **Typed LOCAL spills for the any carrier** — a live-across-yield local of
  object type lowers to a concrete `ref $Object`, whose exact wasm type the
  up-front state-struct layout cannot know without a body pre-pass (the "deeper
  rewrite" the architect flagged). So an any-carrier generator that needs to
  spill ANY local bails to the host path in `buildNativeGeneratorPlan`
  (consistent across the candidate gate and registration). Numeric/string spills
  (f64) are unaffected. This is the single biggest remaining widener — needs a
  two-pass spill-typing pass.
- **Spread / `Array.from` precision for the boxed-any carrier** — drains to a
  vec whose element type must match the array-literal heuristic; for an object
  generator the literal infers a concrete-struct vec ≠ the externref drain vec,
  so the conservative skip leaves an (empty, host-free, valid) array. Strictly
  better than the pre-F1 host-import instantiation failure, but semantically
  incomplete. Array destructuring (which uses the carrier vec directly) DOES work.
- **F2** (try/catch/finally across yield + `return()`/`throw()`), **F3**
  (`yield*` over arbitrary iterables) — separate PRs per the issue's slicing.

### Files

- `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` — carrier decision, per-carrier frame
  field typing, boxed-any yield/sent/abrupt emission, gated open dispatch +
  generalised open result reader.
- `src/codegen/literals.ts`, `src/codegen/statements/destructuring.ts` — vec
  drain consumers parametrised on the generator's carrier element type.
- `tests/issue-2864-standalone-generator-carrier.test.ts` — 8 standalone cases
  (zero-host-import asserted).

## F1b — typed live-across-yield LOCAL spills (landed)

**Scope shipped:** a generator that carries an OBJECT / STRING / typed-struct
local across a `yield` now compiles host-free in standalone/WASI, instead of
mis-compiling (the f64 spill field could not hold a `ref`) or bailing. The
spill field, the resume-function load local, and the state-struct construction
default are all minted at the local's **actual** ValType.

Verify-first (`function* g(){ let o={n:1}; yield 1; yield o.n }`, read via
`.next().value`): **CE-refused** on main → host-free + returns `2` after F1b
(`result.imports` empty). Also host-free: numeric/string LOCAL spills, an
object-yield carrier WITH an object local spill, and loop-carried object spills
drained via `for-of`. gc-mode unchanged (the native path is gated
`noJsHostTarget`); numeric spills stay byte-identical (f64).

### Why these decisions (root-cause, not symptom)

The F1 notes framed this as gated on the **any** carrier, but the dominant
failure is broader: a generator with **numeric** yields and an **object/string
LOCAL** (e.g. `let o={…}; yield 1; yield o.n`) is an f64-carrier generator whose
spill field was hardcoded f64 (`stateFields … {kind:"f64"}`), the resume-load
local was hardcoded f64, and the struct-init pushed `f64.const NaN` — so the
object local's `ref` value mis-stored against an f64 field → a hard wasm
validation error (`local.set expected (ref null N), found struct.get of type
f64`). The fix types all three sites per-spill.

- **Spill type resolved by `resolveSpillLocalValType` (in `variables.ts`).** The
  resume function compiles the body with a FRESH `FunctionContext` whose analysis
  caches are empty and whose locals never resolve to a module global, so the type
  its var-declaration computes reduces to the **fctx-independent** subset of the
  `compileVariableStatement` cascade — the ctx/AST externref-forcing overrides
  plus `localTypeForDeclaration`. The helper replicates exactly that subset (it
  lives next to those predicates so they stay in lockstep) and returns `null` for
  any form whose representation the up-front layout cannot match (Proxy, accessor
  / spread / growable object literals, `subarray` subview, regexp-match arrays,
  `Array<any>` vecs, …). A `null` for ANY spill keeps the WHOLE generator on the
  host path — a conservative, non-regressing bail consistent across the candidate
  gate and registration.
- **Non-null `ref` widened to `ref_null`.** `resolveWasmType` returns a non-null
  `ref` for object literals, but a wasm local is widened to nullable and a
  non-null ref struct field has no `struct.new` default. So spills carry
  `ref_null`; `struct.get` of a nullable ref is valid and traps-on-null exactly
  as the source semantics require.
- **Post-emission reconcile.** The body's var-declaration reuses the
  pre-allocated spill slot and may re-type it (e.g. narrow `ref_null` → non-null
  `ref`). After the resume body is emitted, each spill's FINAL local type is
  read back, widened to `ref_null`, and pinned onto BOTH the local slot and the
  state-struct field (+ `info.spillTypes`, which the constructor init reads). This
  runs before any `struct.new` of the state struct (the constructor calls the
  resume builder first), so the init defaults observe the reconciled types — no
  prediction-vs-emission divergence can slip through.

### Deferred (F1b — kept on the host path; correctness-preserving)

- **Boxed-any `.next(v)` RESUME bindings** (`let x = yield …` where the yields are
  object/mixed → externref carrier): the sent value is an externref whose later
  **member** reads need the any-receiver dispatch (#2151), which silently computes
  a wrong value here. So an any-carrier generator with a resume binding still
  bails to the host path (exactly as F1 did) — a CE-refusal is correct, a wrong
  answer is not. Numeric/native-string resume bindings (sent = f64 / string) ARE
  supported. Widening the boxed-any sent-value reads is an F1c follow-up that
  builds on #2151.
- **String-ELEM generators read via `.next().value as string`** remain blocked on
  a PRE-EXISTING #2171 string-carrier result-reader mismatch (result `value`
  typeIdx ≠ the produced string vec), independent of spills — reproduces with a
  zero-spill string generator. Not in F1b scope.

### Files (F1b)

- `src/codegen/statements/variables.ts` — new exported `resolveSpillLocalValType`.
- `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` — per-spill `spillTypes` in the plan + info,
  typed spill fields / resume-load locals / `struct.new` defaults
  (`defaultSpillInstr`), the any-carrier resume-binding bail, and the
  post-emission spill-type reconcile. Retired the F1 `elemIsAny && spills>0` and
  string-elem spill guards (subsumed by per-spill resolution).
- `src/codegen/context/types.ts` — `NativeGeneratorInfo.spillTypes`.
- `tests/issue-2864-standalone-generator-carrier.test.ts` — 6 F1b standalone
  cases (zero-host-import asserted).

## F2 — `gen.throw()` abrupt completion (landed)

**Scope shipped:** `gen.throw(e)` now completes a native generator host-free —
running enclosing `finally` blocks and then propagating the error to the
`.throw(e)` caller. Previously `.throw()` was effectively unimplemented: the open
dispatch (`buildNativeGeneratorDispatch`) lumped it into the `.return()` arm
(mode 1), so it silently _completed_ the generator instead of throwing and never
ran the `finally`.

Verify-first (`--target standalone`):
`function* g(){ try { yield 1; yield 2 } finally { log = 42 } }` with
`it.throw(new Error())` mid-yield → **before:** `log` stayed 0 and the error did
NOT propagate (silently wrong); **after:** `finally` runs (`log === 42`) and the
error is caught by the caller, all host-free (`result.imports` empty). Also
host-free: `throw()` on a plain-suspended / not-started / exhausted generator all
propagate the error; `return()` through try/finally is unchanged.

### Why these decisions (root-cause, not symptom)

- **A dedicated externref `error` field** (`ERROR_FIELD`, `PARAM_FIELD_OFFSET`
  4→5). The thrown value is always an Error object (externref), but the
  `sent`/`abrupt` carrier fields are f64 in a numeric generator, so the error
  needs its own slot. Added once to every state struct (inert for non-throw
  paths); `PARAM_FIELD_OFFSET`-derived spill/deleg offsets shift automatically.
- **Resume mode 2 = throw**, alongside 0 = next, 1 = return. The per-state abrupt
  block (present at EVERY yield-successor, finalizers possibly empty) now guards
  on `mode != 0`, runs the finalizers + spill-store + done-transition ONCE, then
  branches: mode 2 → `local.get error; throw $exnTag` (stack-polymorphic, so the
  generator unwinds to the caller after the finally ran); mode 1 → complete with
  the return value (unchanged). Reuses the existing wasm-EH tag
  (`ensureExnTag`) — the same one `throw`/`try` statements use — so no new
  import and host-free.
- **`.throw()` wired in BOTH dispatch paths.** The direct (concrete-`Generator`-
  typed receiver) and open (`let it = g()` → externref) paths each get a throw
  arm: SUSPENDED → write the error field, set mode 2, resume (re-throws after
  finalizers); NOT-STARTED / DONE → mark done and `throw` the error directly
  (§27.5.3.4 GeneratorResumeAbrupt). The open path is the load-bearing one (most
  `it.throw()` receivers are externref-typed).

### Deferred (F2 — kept on the host path)

- **try/CATCH across a yield** (a `catch` clause spanning a suspend point, and
  `gen.throw()` routed INTO a catch) still bails to the host path
  (`generators-native.ts` try-statement lowering: `if (stmt.catchClause) fail()`).
  This is the next slice — it needs the state machine to model catch-handler
  regions (which yield-successor states are covered by which catch) and route a
  mode-2 resume to the catch state with the error bound, rather than re-throwing.
- **yield inside a `finally`** block remains unsupported (the finally must be
  yield-free, unchanged from F1).

### Files (F2)

- `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` — `ERROR_FIELD` + `MODE_*` constants
  (`PARAM_FIELD_OFFSET` 4→5), error field in the state struct + its
  `ref.null.extern` init, mode-2 arm in the per-state abrupt block, `.throw()`
  in both `compileDirectNativeGeneratorMethod` and `buildNativeGeneratorDispatch`
  (+ externref error local threading through `tryCompileNativeGeneratorMethodCall`),
  `ensureExnTag` import.
- `tests/issue-2864-standalone-generator-carrier.test.ts` — 5 F2 standalone cases
  (zero-host-import asserted).

## Reconciliation note (shepherd, 2026-07-01)

Landed slices: **F1** heterogeneous boxed-any carrier (PR #2366), **F1b** typed live-across-yield local spills (PR #2372), **F2** `gen.throw()` abrupt completion (PR #2375). Issue stays `in-progress` for the remaining carrier phases.

## Carrier-completion design (fable-gencarrier, 2026-07-04) — measured status + remaining protocol

### Measured `return <value>` status (corrects the task framing)

Probed on main (standalone, host-free asserted): `return <value>` routing in
the NATIVE carrier is **already complete** — terminal `{value, done:true}`
exactly once then `{undefined, done:true}` (11111 canary), for-of/spread
exclude it (203 canary), mid-loop `return`, boxed-any `return {…}`,
string-carrier `return "z"`, and `gen.return(v)` value round-trip (numeric +
open dispatch) all pass. What was actually missing on the sync-carrier side:

1. **`const x = yield* inner()`** — the delegation COMPLETION value
   (§27.5.3.7: the yield\* expression's value is `innerRes.value` once
   `innerRes.done`) had no binding path (plan bailed → #680 CE). → **R1, this
   PR.**
2. **`yield*` over a general iterable** — #2173 (design refreshed there;
   slice-2a is NOT #2106-blocked).
3. **IR front-end (js-host lane)**: IR generators still throw-defer any
   `return <expr>` to legacy (#2035 note in `from-ast.ts lowerTail`) — blocks
   the #2951 skip-set retirement. Exact Opus-executable contract banked in
   #2951 ("gen.setReturn" section).

### R1 (this PR) — yield\* completion-value binding + carrier-mismatch gate

- **`const x = yield* inner()`**: the `yield-star` terminator gains
  `bindResultTo`. The done-arm delivers `innerRes.value` (f64 — inners are
  f64-gated) into the binding's pre-allocated local AND its spill field
  BEFORE transitioning to the successor, inside the same resume call that
  observed completion. Deliberately NOT a resume binding: resume bindings
  re-read the `sent` field on every entry, which would clobber the completion
  value with the next `.next(v)` argument. Spill typed f64 via a dedicated
  `delegationBindingNames` set (the decl-shape cascade in
  `resolveSpillLocalValType` doesn't model yield\* initializers; the
  `sent`-carrier rule types `.next(v)` bindings — both wrong here).
- **Latent invalid-wasm fix**: the #2170 delegation gate checked only the
  INNER's elem type. A **string-carrier outer** delegating to an f64 inner
  emitted a module that FAILED WASM VALIDATION at instantiation (f64 →
  concrete-ref result field; `repairStructTypeMismatches` has no repair for
  that pair — the boxed-any outer only works because fixups.ts repairs
  f64→externref to `__box_number`). R1 bails `elemIsString` outers to the
  host path → clean #680 refusal. Do NOT "fix" this by leaning further on the
  repair pass; if string-outer delegation is wanted later, emit an explicit
  elem conversion in the yield-arm.
- **Byte-inertness**: 8-program × 3-lane sha256 matrix (numeric/any/string
  gens, slice-1 delegation, any-outer delegation, spill gen, plain, host gen ×
  gc/standalone/wasi) — all identical before/after; only programs using the
  NEW shapes change.
- **Known residual (pre-existing, NOT R1)**: an inner that completes without
  an explicit `return` delivers the f64 carrier's undefined-as-NaN sentinel,
  so `x === x` diverges from Node (`false` vs `true`). This is the #2106
  value-rep undefined-observability class, same as `.next()`-with-no-arg
  resume bindings today. Do not pin it in tests.

### Remaining protocol gaps (banked slices, exact contracts)

- **D2 — delegation abrupt forwarding (iterator close through yield\*)**:
  `.return(v)` / `.throw(e)` on the OUTER while suspended in a `yield-star`
  state must forward to the INNER (`inner.return`/`inner.throw`, §27.5.3.7
  steps 7.b/7.c) so the inner's `finally` blocks run, then continue the
  outer's abrupt path. Today the outer's per-state abrupt block completes the
  outer WITHOUT closing the inner (inner finalizers silently skipped).
  Contract: in the yield-star state's abrupt block (mode != 0), when the
  delegation slot is non-null, drive the inner's resume once with the SAME
  mode + abrupt/error payload (write inner's `MODE`/`ABRUPT`/`ERROR` fields,
  call its resume fn), discard the inner's result, null the slot, then run the
  outer's own finalizers as today. Wasm-level: mirrors F2's mode-2 wiring, one
  extra call in the abrupt block, gated on `delegationSlots` non-empty —
  byte-inert for non-delegating generators. Test: M3 probe shape
  (`inner try/finally`, outer `.return()` mid-delegation → inner `log`
  written + outer completes with the return value).
- **D3 — general-iterable `yield*`**: lives in #2173 (vec-cursor for numeric
  arrays — slice-2a there, NOT blocked by #2106; generic `{next()}` +
  `.return()` close as slice-2b, which SHOULD reuse D2's forwarding shape).
- **D4 — try/CATCH across yield** (F2 deferral): do NOT extend the ad-hoc
  region modeling in `generators-native.ts` for this — see the alignment
  decision below; catch-region routing is exactly what #2906 slice 3c builds
  for async. Trigger point for the planner convergence.

### Alignment decision: sync generators vs the #2906 AsyncCfgPlan machine

**Question** (from the dispatch): should sync generators ride the #2906
multi-state CFG machine rather than a parallel mechanism?

**Answer: converge at the PLANNER, not the emitter, and only at the D4/W6
trigger — do not port the sync carrier now.** Rationale:

1. **The ABI layer is ALREADY converged.** `frame-core.ts` owns the shared
   frame ABI (`STATE`/`SENT`/`MODE`/`ABRUPT`/`ERROR`, `storeSpills`,
   `setStateInstrs`) consumed by BOTH `generators-native.ts` and
   `async-frame.ts`. The #2618 interpreter's PC-in-`$Frame` bytecode
   suspension is the same model (saved integer position + spilled locals in a
   heap frame) — all three stories are coherent today.
2. **The two machines differ ONLY in suspend/settle backends.** Generator
   `yield` returns `{value, done}` synchronously to the caller; async
   `suspend` registers a promise reaction and returns. `jump`≈`goto`,
   `branch`≈`condGoto`, `return/done`≈`settle*` are already isomorphic.
   What is DUPLICATED is the **statement-tree → state-graph planner**
   (loops/ifs/try-region lowering exists in both files, independently).
3. **Why not port now**: the sync planner+emitter is load-bearing for ~250
   native-gen tests with byte-stability discipline; a port is pure churn with
   zero functional win until a shape needs what only the CFG machine has.
   #2906's planner is also still growing its region model (3c: catch-states,
   completion replay, nested regions) — porting onto a moving substrate
   re-derives the #2367 graveyard.
4. **The convergence trigger is D4 (try/catch-across-yield) / #3032 W6
   (buffer retirement).** Both need catch-region routing + replay — exactly
   #2906 3c. When 3c has landed and proven in the async lane, add a **sync
   settle backend** to the CFG emitter (`yield` terminator → build result
   struct + return, instead of fulfil+microtask) and route NEW generator
   shapes through `planAsyncCfg`; retire `generators-native`'s ad-hoc
   structural lowering only when the CFG path's corpus is net-zero on the
   native-gen suites. **#2865 (async generators) must NOT wait for that
   retirement**: it stacks directly on #2906 3d (`settleYield` terminator +
   result-promise queue), which is the designed convergence point of the two
   frames — building async gens on `generators-native.ts` instead would be a
   third machine. Rule of thumb going forward: **new control-flow capability →
   CFG planner; carrier/value-rep capability → generators-native.**

### Composition with #3032 lazy-first-resume thunks

Disjoint lanes, one destination. The thunk model is the JS-HOST answer for
expression/nested/method generators (eager buffer made lazy at creation); the
native carrier is standalone-only (`noJsHostTarget`) and already truly lazy —
nothing runs until the first resume, `return()`/`throw()` before start never
run the body (F2), matching the thunk model's §27.5.3.2 behavior. No gating
interaction exists today (verified: R1 touches only the native path; js-host
bytes identical). The composition rules:

- **#3032 W3 route (b) (#2203 capture slots in the state struct) is the
  preferred endgame** over widening route (a) thunk-wraps: every generator
  family that becomes a native candidate exits the buffer model entirely
  (and with it the thunk hack) in standalone; W6 then widens the native
  carrier to js-host, retiring both.
- **Do not add new eager-buffer capabilities** beyond the #2951 IR
  `gen.setReturn` unblock (needed for the IR-first flip in the js-host lane
  regardless of W6 timing).
- Any future js-host widening of the native carrier must preserve #3032's
  observable contract: creation runs nothing; `next(v)` two-way communication
  (impossible under the buffer) comes free with the carrier.
