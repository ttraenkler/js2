# Standalone: Wasm-native generator carrier (sync)

## Problem

Sync generators (`function*`, generator methods, `yield`/`yield*`) work in
js-host via host imports but have **no general standalone carrier**. Only
"sequential numeric yields" are lowered natively (#680); anything else leaks
`__create_generator` / `__gen_create_buffer` / `__gen_next` / `__gen_yield_star`
/ `__gen_result_value` / `__gen_set_return` / `__gen_push_ref` / `__gen_push_f64`,
which under standalone either fail instantiation or hit the #680 refusal
(`src/codegen/function-body.ts:1020`).

### Impact (measured 2026-06-30) — ~697 standalone-only failures

Leaked imports across the gap: `__gen_create_buffer` 1,648, `__gen_next` 1,070,
`__create_generator` 748, `__gen_yield_star` 505 (these counts include the async
cases tracked in #2865). Manifests as `fail` (598) and CE (99); many proximate
errors are `illegal cast [in __obj_find() ← __extern_set]` inside the
destructuring/iterator machinery that the generator drives.

## Root cause

There is no Wasm-native coroutine/state-machine lowering for general generator
bodies in standalone. The host carrier buffers yields in a JS-side structure
(`__gen_*`). A standalone generator needs either:

1. a **resumable state-machine transform** (CPS / explicit state var + switch on
   re-entry, locals spilled to a heap frame struct), or
2. WasmGC **stack-switching** (the `stack-switching` proposal) if the target
   runtime enables it — but CLAUDE.md notes wasmtime rejects all-proposals; this
   is not portable yet.

Approach (1) is the portable path: lower a generator body to a `$GenFrame`
struct (captured locals + an i32 `state`), and a `next(frame, sentValue)`
function that `br_table`s on `state` to the resume point, runs to the next
`yield`, stores the next state, and returns `{value, done}`. `yield*` delegates
to the inner iterator's `next`.

## Implementation Plan

**Architecture-scale — tagged `architect_spec: candidate`.** Design needed
before coding. Key decisions for the architect:

- Frame representation: `struct $GenFrame (field $state (mut i32)) (field $localN (mut T))…`
  one field per live-across-yield local; reuse the ref-cell pattern for captures.
- State-machine transform location: in IR lowering (`src/ir/lower.ts`) vs the
  legacy codegen generator path (`src/codegen/function-body.ts`,
  `class-bodies.ts`, `closures.ts`). Prefer IR if generator nodes are adopted;
  else extend the #680 native path in function-body.ts:1020.
- `IteratorResult` representation: reuse the existing `{value, done}` $Object or
  a nominal struct; must satisfy the for-of / spread / destructuring consumers
  natively (overlaps #2863 `__array_from_iter_n` spread).
- `return()`/`throw()` completion (try/finally inside generators) → finally
  blocks must run on early completion; the state machine must encode finally
  regions.

Start scope: plain `function*` with value yields + `yield*` over an array /
another native generator. Defer `[Symbol.iterator]`-driven `yield*` over an
arbitrary host iterator until the iterator-protocol carrier is native.

## Test plan

Standalone fail/CE → pass:

- `test/language/expressions/yield/**`, `test/language/statements/generators/**`
- `test/built-ins/GeneratorFunction/**`, `test/built-ins/GeneratorPrototype/**`
- `test/built-ins/Iterator/prototype/{map,take,drop,flatMap}/**` (driven by gens)

Full `merge_group` + standalone high-water. This is the single largest lever
(sync 697 + async 986 = 1,683 combined with #2865). Sequence #2864 before #2865
(async generators build on this).

## F1 — heterogeneous (boxed-`any`) carrier (landed)

**Scope shipped:** object / mixed-type yields now lower to the Wasm-native
generator carrier host-free in standalone/WASI, via the dominant consumers:
`.next()` / `.next().value` (open dispatch), `for-of`, and array destructuring.
Verify-first (`function* g(){ yield {a:1}; yield 2 }` → `r1.value.a + r2.value`)
compiles with **zero host imports** and returns `3` (the yielded object survives
the frame). gc-mode unchanged; numeric / string carriers byte-for-byte unchanged.

### Why these decisions (root-cause, not symptom)

The resumable frame already existed — `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` is a
`br_table`-on-state-machine, but its `value`/`sent`/`abrupt`/spill slots were
f64-only (#1665) or a uniform native-string ref (#2171). `generatorElemValType`
returned `null` for object/mixed yields, which routed them to the eager-buffer
**host** path (`__gen_*` imports) — fatal under standalone. F1 generalises the
frame rather than building a new one.

- **Carrier = `externref`, not a bespoke tagged struct.** The `any` TS type
  already maps to `externref` (`type-mapper.ts`), and the boxing seams
  (`__box_number`, `extern.convert_any`) are **native defined funcs** under
  `target: standalone|wasi` (`addUnionImportsAsNativeFuncs`), so every JS value
  boxes to externref with NO host import. Using externref (over anyref) means a
  consumer reading `.value` / a for-of loop var as `any` needs no extra coercion
  — the carrier IS the `any` representation the rest of codegen agrees on.
- **`sent`/`abrupt` typed PER-CARRIER** (`genCarrierFieldType`): externref for
  the boxed-any carrier, f64 for numeric/string. The state struct is minted
  per-generator, so this keeps the numeric/string structs and all their call
  sites byte-identical — zero regression risk to the ~250 existing native-gen
  tests — while the any frame carries arbitrary `.next(v)`/`.return(v)` values.
- **Open dispatch (`buildNativeGeneratorDispatch`) was the load-bearing path.**
  `let it = g()` types `it` as `Generator<…>` → externref (the state struct is
  boxed), so `it.next()` routes through the open anyref dispatch, NOT the
  concrete-typed direct path. The dispatch keyed its enclosing block on the f64
  IteratorResult singleton and set one shared f64 `sent` across branches — it
  could not host a boxed-any branch (distinct result struct, externref sent). Fix
  is **gated on `hasAny`**: a module with no any-carrier generator keeps the
  exact f64-singleton dispatch (byte-identical); a module that has one switches
  the block type to `eqref` (common supertype of all result structs) and emits
  the `.next(v)` arg both as externref (any branches) and f64 (numeric branches,
  derived by one unbox so a side-effecting arg evals once). This confines all
  behavioural change to modules that actually use the new carrier.
- **Open result reader** (`tryCompileNativeGeneratorResultProperty`) now
  ref-tests EVERY distinct result struct (not just the f64 singleton): `.done`
  is uniformly i32; `.value` picks its return ValType from the **static** type of
  the `.value` property (number → f64 fast path preserved; object/any →
  externref). This is why numeric `.next().value` reads are unchanged.

### Deferred (follow-ups; all bail cleanly / are non-regressing today)

- **Typed LOCAL spills for the any carrier** — a live-across-yield local of
  object type lowers to a concrete `ref $Object`, whose exact wasm type the
  up-front state-struct layout cannot know without a body pre-pass (the "deeper
  rewrite" the architect flagged). So an any-carrier generator that needs to
  spill ANY local bails to the host path in `buildNativeGeneratorPlan`
  (consistent across the candidate gate and registration). Numeric/string spills
  (f64) are unaffected. This is the single biggest remaining widener — needs a
  two-pass spill-typing pass.
- **Spread / `Array.from` precision for the boxed-any carrier** — drains to a
  vec whose element type must match the array-literal heuristic; for an object
  generator the literal infers a concrete-struct vec ≠ the externref drain vec,
  so the conservative skip leaves an (empty, host-free, valid) array. Strictly
  better than the pre-F1 host-import instantiation failure, but semantically
  incomplete. Array destructuring (which uses the carrier vec directly) DOES work.
- **F2** (try/catch/finally across yield + `return()`/`throw()`), **F3**
  (`yield*` over arbitrary iterables) — separate PRs per the issue's slicing.

### Files

- `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` — carrier decision, per-carrier frame
  field typing, boxed-any yield/sent/abrupt emission, gated open dispatch +
  generalised open result reader.
- `src/codegen/literals.ts`, `src/codegen/statements/destructuring.ts` — vec
  drain consumers parametrised on the generator's carrier element type.
- `tests/issue-2864-standalone-generator-carrier.test.ts` — 8 standalone cases
  (zero-host-import asserted).

## F1b — typed live-across-yield LOCAL spills (landed)

**Scope shipped:** a generator that carries an OBJECT / STRING / typed-struct
local across a `yield` now compiles host-free in standalone/WASI, instead of
mis-compiling (the f64 spill field could not hold a `ref`) or bailing. The
spill field, the resume-function load local, and the state-struct construction
default are all minted at the local's **actual** ValType.

Verify-first (`function* g(){ let o={n:1}; yield 1; yield o.n }`, read via
`.next().value`): **CE-refused** on main → host-free + returns `2` after F1b
(`result.imports` empty). Also host-free: numeric/string LOCAL spills, an
object-yield carrier WITH an object local spill, and loop-carried object spills
drained via `for-of`. gc-mode unchanged (the native path is gated
`noJsHostTarget`); numeric spills stay byte-identical (f64).

### Why these decisions (root-cause, not symptom)

The F1 notes framed this as gated on the **any** carrier, but the dominant
failure is broader: a generator with **numeric** yields and an **object/string
LOCAL** (e.g. `let o={…}; yield 1; yield o.n`) is an f64-carrier generator whose
spill field was hardcoded f64 (`stateFields … {kind:"f64"}`), the resume-load
local was hardcoded f64, and the struct-init pushed `f64.const NaN` — so the
object local's `ref` value mis-stored against an f64 field → a hard wasm
validation error (`local.set expected (ref null N), found struct.get of type
f64`). The fix types all three sites per-spill.

- **Spill type resolved by `resolveSpillLocalValType` (in `variables.ts`).** The
  resume function compiles the body with a FRESH `FunctionContext` whose analysis
  caches are empty and whose locals never resolve to a module global, so the type
  its var-declaration computes reduces to the **fctx-independent** subset of the
  `compileVariableStatement` cascade — the ctx/AST externref-forcing overrides
  plus `localTypeForDeclaration`. The helper replicates exactly that subset (it
  lives next to those predicates so they stay in lockstep) and returns `null` for
  any form whose representation the up-front layout cannot match (Proxy, accessor
  / spread / growable object literals, `subarray` subview, regexp-match arrays,
  `Array<any>` vecs, …). A `null` for ANY spill keeps the WHOLE generator on the
  host path — a conservative, non-regressing bail consistent across the candidate
  gate and registration.
- **Non-null `ref` widened to `ref_null`.** `resolveWasmType` returns a non-null
  `ref` for object literals, but a wasm local is widened to nullable and a
  non-null ref struct field has no `struct.new` default. So spills carry
  `ref_null`; `struct.get` of a nullable ref is valid and traps-on-null exactly
  as the source semantics require.
- **Post-emission reconcile.** The body's var-declaration reuses the
  pre-allocated spill slot and may re-type it (e.g. narrow `ref_null` → non-null
  `ref`). After the resume body is emitted, each spill's FINAL local type is
  read back, widened to `ref_null`, and pinned onto BOTH the local slot and the
  state-struct field (+ `info.spillTypes`, which the constructor init reads). This
  runs before any `struct.new` of the state struct (the constructor calls the
  resume builder first), so the init defaults observe the reconciled types — no
  prediction-vs-emission divergence can slip through.

### Deferred (F1b — kept on the host path; correctness-preserving)

- **Boxed-any `.next(v)` RESUME bindings** (`let x = yield …` where the yields are
  object/mixed → externref carrier): the sent value is an externref whose later
  **member** reads need the any-receiver dispatch (#2151), which silently computes
  a wrong value here. So an any-carrier generator with a resume binding still
  bails to the host path (exactly as F1 did) — a CE-refusal is correct, a wrong
  answer is not. Numeric/native-string resume bindings (sent = f64 / string) ARE
  supported. Widening the boxed-any sent-value reads is an F1c follow-up that
  builds on #2151.
- **String-ELEM generators read via `.next().value as string`** remain blocked on
  a PRE-EXISTING #2171 string-carrier result-reader mismatch (result `value`
  typeIdx ≠ the produced string vec), independent of spills — reproduces with a
  zero-spill string generator. Not in F1b scope.

### Files (F1b)

- `src/codegen/statements/variables.ts` — new exported `resolveSpillLocalValType`.
- `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` — per-spill `spillTypes` in the plan + info,
  typed spill fields / resume-load locals / `struct.new` defaults
  (`defaultSpillInstr`), the any-carrier resume-binding bail, and the
  post-emission spill-type reconcile. Retired the F1 `elemIsAny && spills>0` and
  string-elem spill guards (subsumed by per-spill resolution).
- `src/codegen/context/types.ts` — `NativeGeneratorInfo.spillTypes`.
- `tests/issue-2864-standalone-generator-carrier.test.ts` — 6 F1b standalone
  cases (zero-host-import asserted).

## F2 — `gen.throw()` abrupt completion (landed)

**Scope shipped:** `gen.throw(e)` now completes a native generator host-free —
running enclosing `finally` blocks and then propagating the error to the
`.throw(e)` caller. Previously `.throw()` was effectively unimplemented: the open
dispatch (`buildNativeGeneratorDispatch`) lumped it into the `.return()` arm
(mode 1), so it silently _completed_ the generator instead of throwing and never
ran the `finally`.

Verify-first (`--target standalone`):
`function* g(){ try { yield 1; yield 2 } finally { log = 42 } }` with
`it.throw(new Error())` mid-yield → **before:** `log` stayed 0 and the error did
NOT propagate (silently wrong); **after:** `finally` runs (`log === 42`) and the
error is caught by the caller, all host-free (`result.imports` empty). Also
host-free: `throw()` on a plain-suspended / not-started / exhausted generator all
propagate the error; `return()` through try/finally is unchanged.

### Why these decisions (root-cause, not symptom)

- **A dedicated externref `error` field** (`ERROR_FIELD`, `PARAM_FIELD_OFFSET`
  4→5). The thrown value is always an Error object (externref), but the
  `sent`/`abrupt` carrier fields are f64 in a numeric generator, so the error
  needs its own slot. Added once to every state struct (inert for non-throw
  paths); `PARAM_FIELD_OFFSET`-derived spill/deleg offsets shift automatically.
- **Resume mode 2 = throw**, alongside 0 = next, 1 = return. The per-state abrupt
  block (present at EVERY yield-successor, finalizers possibly empty) now guards
  on `mode != 0`, runs the finalizers + spill-store + done-transition ONCE, then
  branches: mode 2 → `local.get error; throw $exnTag` (stack-polymorphic, so the
  generator unwinds to the caller after the finally ran); mode 1 → complete with
  the return value (unchanged). Reuses the existing wasm-EH tag
  (`ensureExnTag`) — the same one `throw`/`try` statements use — so no new
  import and host-free.
- **`.throw()` wired in BOTH dispatch paths.** The direct (concrete-`Generator`-
  typed receiver) and open (`let it = g()` → externref) paths each get a throw
  arm: SUSPENDED → write the error field, set mode 2, resume (re-throws after
  finalizers); NOT-STARTED / DONE → mark done and `throw` the error directly
  (§27.5.3.4 GeneratorResumeAbrupt). The open path is the load-bearing one (most
  `it.throw()` receivers are externref-typed).

### Deferred (F2 — kept on the host path)

- **try/CATCH across a yield** (a `catch` clause spanning a suspend point, and
  `gen.throw()` routed INTO a catch) still bails to the host path
  (`generators-native.ts` try-statement lowering: `if (stmt.catchClause) fail()`).
  This is the next slice — it needs the state machine to model catch-handler
  regions (which yield-successor states are covered by which catch) and route a
  mode-2 resume to the catch state with the error bound, rather than re-throwing.
- **yield inside a `finally`** block remains unsupported (the finally must be
  yield-free, unchanged from F1).

### Files (F2)

- `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` — `ERROR_FIELD` + `MODE_*` constants
  (`PARAM_FIELD_OFFSET` 4→5), error field in the state struct + its
  `ref.null.extern` init, mode-2 arm in the per-state abrupt block, `.throw()`
  in both `compileDirectNativeGeneratorMethod` and `buildNativeGeneratorDispatch`
  (+ externref error local threading through `tryCompileNativeGeneratorMethodCall`),
  `ensureExnTag` import.
- `tests/issue-2864-standalone-generator-carrier.test.ts` — 5 F2 standalone cases
  (zero-host-import asserted).

## Reconciliation note (shepherd, 2026-07-01)

Landed slices: **F1** heterogeneous boxed-any carrier (PR #2366), **F1b** typed live-across-yield local spills (PR #2372), **F2** `gen.throw()` abrupt completion (PR #2375). Issue stays `in-progress` for the remaining carrier phases.

## Carrier-completion design (fable-gencarrier, 2026-07-04) — measured status + remaining protocol

### Measured `return <value>` status (corrects the task framing)

Probed on main (standalone, host-free asserted): `return <value>` routing in
the NATIVE carrier is **already complete** — terminal `{value, done:true}`
exactly once then `{undefined, done:true}` (11111 canary), for-of/spread
exclude it (203 canary), mid-loop `return`, boxed-any `return {…}`,
string-carrier `return "z"`, and `gen.return(v)` value round-trip (numeric +
open dispatch) all pass. What was actually missing on the sync-carrier side:

1. **`const x = yield* inner()`** — the delegation COMPLETION value
   (§27.5.3.7: the yield\* expression's value is `innerRes.value` once
   `innerRes.done`) had no binding path (plan bailed → #680 CE). → **R1, this
   PR.**
2. **`yield*` over a general iterable** — #2173 (design refreshed there;
   slice-2a is NOT #2106-blocked).
3. **IR front-end (js-host lane)**: IR generators still throw-defer any
   `return <expr>` to legacy (#2035 note in `from-ast.ts lowerTail`) — blocks
   the #2951 skip-set retirement. Exact Opus-executable contract banked in
   #2951 ("gen.setReturn" section).

### R1 (this PR) — yield\* completion-value binding + carrier-mismatch gate

- **`const x = yield* inner()`**: the `yield-star` terminator gains
  `bindResultTo`. The done-arm delivers `innerRes.value` (f64 — inners are
  f64-gated) into the binding's pre-allocated local AND its spill field
  BEFORE transitioning to the successor, inside the same resume call that
  observed completion. Deliberately NOT a resume binding: resume bindings
  re-read the `sent` field on every entry, which would clobber the completion
  value with the next `.next(v)` argument. Spill typed f64 via a dedicated
  `delegationBindingNames` set (the decl-shape cascade in
  `resolveSpillLocalValType` doesn't model yield\* initializers; the
  `sent`-carrier rule types `.next(v)` bindings — both wrong here).
- **Latent invalid-wasm fix**: the #2170 delegation gate checked only the
  INNER's elem type. A **string-carrier outer** delegating to an f64 inner
  emitted a module that FAILED WASM VALIDATION at instantiation (f64 →
  concrete-ref result field; `repairStructTypeMismatches` has no repair for
  that pair — the boxed-any outer only works because fixups.ts repairs
  f64→externref to `__box_number`). R1 bails `elemIsString` outers to the
  host path → clean #680 refusal. Do NOT "fix" this by leaning further on the
  repair pass; if string-outer delegation is wanted later, emit an explicit
  elem conversion in the yield-arm.
- **Byte-inertness**: 8-program × 3-lane sha256 matrix (numeric/any/string
  gens, slice-1 delegation, any-outer delegation, spill gen, plain, host gen ×
  gc/standalone/wasi) — all identical before/after; only programs using the
  NEW shapes change.
- **Known residual (pre-existing, NOT R1)**: an inner that completes without
  an explicit `return` delivers the f64 carrier's undefined-as-NaN sentinel,
  so `x === x` diverges from Node (`false` vs `true`). This is the #2106
  value-rep undefined-observability class, same as `.next()`-with-no-arg
  resume bindings today. Do not pin it in tests.

### Remaining protocol gaps (banked slices, exact contracts)

- **D2 — delegation abrupt forwarding (iterator close through yield\*)**:
  **LANDED 2026-07-23** (see the D2 section below). `.return(v)` / `.throw(e)`
  on the OUTER while suspended in a `yield-star` state forwards to the INNER
  (§27.5.3.7 steps 7.b/7.c) so the inner's `finally` blocks run, then
  continues the outer's abrupt path. Also fixed en route: the self-suspending
  yield-star state is now DEDICATED (never state 0, empty prelude, no resume
  bindings), closing three protocol bugs — first-statement `yield*`
  suspensions misclassified as NOT-STARTED by the dispatch, prelude
  re-execution on every mid-delegation `.next()`, and resume-binding clobber
  by mid-delegation `.next(v)` values.
- **D3 — general-iterable `yield*`**: lives in #2173 (vec-cursor for numeric
  arrays — slice-2a there, NOT blocked by #2106; generic `{next()}` +
  `.return()` close as slice-2b, which SHOULD reuse D2's forwarding shape).
- **D4 — try/CATCH across yield** (F2 deferral): ~~do NOT extend the ad-hoc
  region modeling in `generators-native.ts` for this~~ — **SUPERSEDED, see the
  D4 section below.** #3050 landed `lowerTryRegion` in `generators-native.ts`
  (catch across yield + yielding finally) BEFORE this note was written, so the
  "still bails / converge at the planner" framing was already stale when D4 was
  dispatched. The remaining D4 work was a `doneState` misroute, not a missing
  capability.

### Alignment decision: sync generators vs the #2906 AsyncCfgPlan machine

**Question** (from the dispatch): should sync generators ride the #2906
multi-state CFG machine rather than a parallel mechanism?

**Answer: converge at the PLANNER, not the emitter, and only at the D4/W6
trigger — do not port the sync carrier now.** Rationale:

1. **The ABI layer is ALREADY converged.** `frame-core.ts` owns the shared
   frame ABI (`STATE`/`SENT`/`MODE`/`ABRUPT`/`ERROR`, `storeSpills`,
   `setStateInstrs`) consumed by BOTH `generators-native.ts` and
   `async-frame.ts`. The #2618 interpreter's PC-in-`$Frame` bytecode
   suspension is the same model (saved integer position + spilled locals in a
   heap frame) — all three stories are coherent today.
2. **The two machines differ ONLY in suspend/settle backends.** Generator
   `yield` returns `{value, done}` synchronously to the caller; async
   `suspend` registers a promise reaction and returns. `jump`≈`goto`,
   `branch`≈`condGoto`, `return/done`≈`settle*` are already isomorphic.
   What is DUPLICATED is the **statement-tree → state-graph planner**
   (loops/ifs/try-region lowering exists in both files, independently).
3. **Why not port now**: the sync planner+emitter is load-bearing for ~250
   native-gen tests with byte-stability discipline; a port is pure churn with
   zero functional win until a shape needs what only the CFG machine has.
   #2906's planner is also still growing its region model (3c: catch-states,
   completion replay, nested regions) — porting onto a moving substrate
   re-derives the #2367 graveyard.
4. **The convergence trigger is D4 (try/catch-across-yield) / #3032 W6
   (buffer retirement).** Both need catch-region routing + replay — exactly
   #2906 3c. When 3c has landed and proven in the async lane, add a **sync
   settle backend** to the CFG emitter (`yield` terminator → build result
   struct + return, instead of fulfil+microtask) and route NEW generator
   shapes through `planAsyncCfg`; retire `generators-native`'s ad-hoc
   structural lowering only when the CFG path's corpus is net-zero on the
   native-gen suites. **#2865 (async generators) must NOT wait for that
   retirement**: it stacks directly on #2906 3d (`settleYield` terminator +
   result-promise queue), which is the designed convergence point of the two
   frames — building async gens on `generators-native.ts` instead would be a
   third machine. Rule of thumb going forward: **new control-flow capability →
   CFG planner; carrier/value-rep capability → generators-native.**

## D2 — delegation abrupt forwarding + dedicated yield-star states (landed 2026-07-23)

**Scope shipped:** `.return(v)` / `.throw(e)` on the OUTER generator while
suspended mid-`yield*` now closes the INNER native generator first — driving
its resume once with the same abrupt mode/payloads so its `finally` blocks run
(§27.5.3.7 steps 7.b/7.c) — then continues the outer's own abrupt path
(finalizers → complete/throw). Verify-first (M3 probe, standalone, host-free
asserted): inner `try { yield 1; yield 2 } finally { log = 100 }`, outer
`yield* inner()`, `.return(7)` mid-delegation → **before:** `log` stayed 0 and
(first-statement shape) the outer completed via the NOT-STARTED dispatch arm;
**after:** `log === 100`, result `{7, done: true}` — matches Node exactly, as
do `.throw()` forwarding, inner+outer finally ordering (inner first), a
finally-thrown replacement error (return→throw completion upgrade), and the
loop-carried two-pass close.

### Why these decisions (root-cause, not symptom)

- **Dedicated self-suspend state (plan builder).** A yield-star terminator
  re-enters its OWN state on every resume (`state = THIS`), which surfaced
  three latent protocol bugs beyond the missing close: (a) a first-statement
  `yield*` suspends in **state 0**, which the `.return()`/`.throw()` dispatch
  reads as NOT-STARTED (§27.5.3.4/.3.6) — it completed/threw WITHOUT resuming,
  skipping inner AND outer finalizers; (b) the state's prelude statements
  re-ran on every mid-delegation `.next()` (side effects repeated, measured
  `calls=3` vs Node 1); (c) a preceding `const x = yield …` resume binding
  re-copied `sent` per re-entry, clobbering `x` with later `.next(v)` values
  (measured 7 vs Node 5). The `emitYield` asterisk branch now splits: if the
  current state has prelude statements, resume bindings, or IS state 0, it is
  finished with a `jump` and the yield-star terminator gets a fresh dedicated
  state. It also always carries an `abruptResume` (finalizers recomputed from
  the yield\* position's replay chain, empty outside try) so a mid-delegation
  abrupt is handled even when the yield\* was the generator's first suspend
  point. Applies to all three delegation kinds (native-gen / vec / iterable).
- **Forwarding lives in the generic per-state abrupt block** (`compileState`,
  `abruptResume` branch), gated on the state's terminator being a native-gen
  `yield-star` AND the delegation slot being non-null at runtime — so an
  abrupt at the plain-yield suspension BEFORE delegation starts (slot null)
  skips it, and non-delegating generators are **byte-identical** (verified:
  8-program × 3-lane sha256 matrix unchanged; only delegating programs differ,
  and only in standalone/wasi — the gc lane is byte-identical even for
  delegation, the native yield\* path being standalone-gated).
- **Inner drive is wrapped in wasm `try`/`catch $exn`.** A mode-2 inner
  re-throws after its finalizers (F2 wiring), and an inner `finally` that
  itself throws surfaces a NEW error; both are caught, stored into the outer's
  `ERROR` field, and upgrade the outer's mode to THROW — so the outer's own
  finalizers still run before the error reaches the caller, and a `.return()`
  whose close throws becomes a throw completion (spec). Host-mode foreign JS
  exceptions recover via the #3050 `__get_caught_exception` catch_all when the
  resume emitter acquired it.
- **Inner abrupt payload:** inners are f64-gated, so the inner's `abrupt`
  field takes the outer's `.return(v)` value when the outer carrier is f64,
  else the undefined sentinel — unobservable either way (the inner's close
  result is discarded; the outer completes with its OWN abrupt field, which is
  observably equivalent for every supported shape since a yield-free `finally`
  cannot override the return value).

### Residuals (pre-existing, NOT D2)

- Mid-delegation `.next(v)` does not forward `v` to the inner's `sent` field
  (two-way communication through a running delegation) — same class as the
  buffer-model gaps tracked under #3032; the host lane has the same behavior.
- Generic-iterable (`$__IterRec`) close (`inner.return()` protocol for
  non-generator iterators) is #2173 slice-2b's D2-shape reuse, unchanged here
  (the outer now completes correctly; the foreign iterator is simply not
  notified).
- ~~try/CATCH across yield (D4) stays on the host path — #2906 3c convergence.~~
  **Stale** — see the D4 section below; #3050 had already landed the region
  machinery natively.

### Files (D2)

- `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` — dedicated-state split + always-abrupt
  in the `emitYield` asterisk branch; delegate-close forwarding at the top of
  the `abruptResume` block in `compileState`.
- `tests/issue-2864-standalone-generator-carrier.test.ts` — 10 D2 standalone
  cases (zero-host-import asserted), covering the M3 probe, throw forwarding,
  finally ordering, pre-delegation abrupt, finally-throw upgrade, loop-carried
  close, done protocol, vec first-statement close, prelude-once, and
  resume-binding survival.

## D4 — try/catch across yield: `doneState` misroute (landed 2026-07-24)

### Verify-first: the F2/D2 deferral note was STALE

The dispatch framed D4 as "try/CATCH across a yield still bails to the host
path (`generators-native.ts` try-statement lowering: `if (stmt.catchClause)
fail()`) — converge onto the #2906 CFG planner." **That is not current main.**
#3050 (`fdc11cbd`, "try-region state machine for native generators — catch
across yield + yielding finally") landed `lowerTryRegion` in
`generators-native.ts` well before the note was written; there is no
`if (stmt.catchClause) fail()` anywhere in the file. No planner convergence was
needed, and none was done.

Measured on main (12-shape probe, `--target standalone`, host-free asserted,
each compared against Node on the same source) **9/12 already passed**:
runtime-throw-after-resume caught, `gen.throw()` routed into a catch, catch
that re-yields, try/catch/finally across a yield, `yield` inside a catch,
`yield` inside a finally, catch param read after a yield in the catch, nested
try/catch across a yield, and the boxed-any carrier through a catch.

The 3 that did not:

| shape                                      | before                                           | now                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| try/catch across yield **inside a loop**   | raw wasm exception escaped (catch skipped)       | **fixed here**          |
| `return v` inside try + yield-free finally | finally SKIPPED, silent wrong answer (15 vs 315) | spun off as **#3582**   |
| `yield*` inside a try-region               | clean #680 CE refusal (documented bail)          | unchanged, out of scope |

### Root cause (not the symptom)

`registerNativeGenerator` derived `doneState: plan.states.length - 1`. That
coincides with the final `done` state **only for a straight-line body**. Every
structural lowering — `lowerFor` / `lowerWhile` / `lowerDoWhile` / `lowerIf`
and the #3050 `lowerTryRegion` — reserves its exit/join state **before**
lowering the nested body, so a body that ENDS in one of those leaves the
fallthrough cursor at a LOWER id, and `states.length - 1` is then a **live
yield-successor state**.

Measured plans (`curId` = the state given the final `done` terminator):

| body shape                         | states | fallthrough | `states.length-1` |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| straight-line (control)            | 7      | 6           | 6 ✅              |
| `try { yield } catch {}` as body   | 5      | **3**       | 4 ❌ (yield succ) |
| `for … { try { yield } catch {} }` | 9      | **4**       | 8 ❌ (yield succ) |
| `if (…) { yield } else { yield }`  | 6      | **3**       | 5 ❌ (yield succ) |
| nested `for`/`for`                 | 10     | **4**       | 9 ❌ (yield succ) |

The consumer's suspension test is
`suspended = state != START && state != doneState`
(`generators-native-consumer.ts`). With the alias in place, a generator
genuinely suspended at that last-reserved yield state reported **DONE**, so
`.throw(e)` / `.return(v)` took the §27.5.3.4 _already-completed_ arm and
**never resumed** — the enclosing `catch` across the yield never ran and the
error escaped raw. The same alias also made the `done` terminator store a LIVE
state id as "completed", so a post-exhaustion `.next()` re-entered live states
(benignly idempotent for a simple loop, but it re-ran the loop's update
expression).

Why the failure looked try/catch-specific but is not: without a handler the
already-completed arm's observable behaviour _coincides_ with the correct one
(`.return(v)` → `{v, done:true}`, `.throw(e)` → throws `e`). Only when there is
a finalizer/handler to run does the misroute become visible. So the bug is
**loop/if/try-TAIL-shaped**, not try/catch-shaped, and it was latent in every
such generator since the structural lowerings were added.

### The fix

`buildNativeGeneratorPlan` now returns the real `doneState` — the fallthrough
cursor, or the dedicated empty placeholder it already minted when that state
carries trailing statements (#3050's re-run guard) — and
`registerNativeGenerator` consumes `plan.doneState`. Three lines of behaviour;
the rest is the explanation above, banked at both definition sites.

Safety argument, verified rather than asserted: a `yield` terminator always
mints a FRESH successor as the new cursor, so the state that receives the final
`done` terminator can only coincide with a suspension point when the body's
last statement is itself a `yield` — in which case the two ids were already
equal before this change and the pre-existing (spec-equivalent, handler-free)
behaviour is preserved bit-for-bit.

### Measured delta (8-shape × 3-lane matrix, host-free asserted)

| shape                                                      | before (standalone/wasi) | after        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| M1 `try { yield } catch {}` as whole body, `.throw()`      | raw wasm exception       | ✅ 511       |
| M2 `for … { try { yield } catch {} }`, `.throw()`          | raw wasm exception       | ✅ 101       |
| M3 `while … { try { yield } catch {} }`, `.throw()`        | raw wasm exception       | ✅ 101       |
| M8 nested `for`/`for` under one try, `.throw()`            | raw wasm exception       | ✅ 301       |
| M4/M5/M7 `.return()` through a finally (loop/if/loop-tail) | already correct          | ✅ unchanged |
| M6 straight-line try/catch + trailing yield (control)      | already correct          | ✅ unchanged |

**4 measured shapes flip from a raw escaping exception to spec behaviour; 4
controls unchanged.** The gc lane is untouched for every try/catch shape above
— all still route to the eager-buffer host path (`__gen_*` present), so this is
a standalone + wasi delta. A PLAIN loop-tail generator (no try) DOES route
native on gc, so gc bytes change there; observable behaviour does not (see the
handler-free coincidence above), and the byte matrix covers it.

### Files (D4)

- `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` — `NativeGeneratorPlan.doneState` (new,
  with the root-cause note), computed at the final fallthrough in
  `buildNativeGeneratorPlan`, consumed by `registerNativeGenerator`.
- `tests/issue-2864-d4-catch-across-yield.test.ts` — standalone regression
  suite (zero-host-import asserted).

### Deferred out of D4 (each has a clean, non-silent fallback today)

- **#3582** — `return v` inside a try with a yield-free finally skips the
  finally (silent wrong answer). Root cause + the recommended fix shape are
  recorded there.
- **`yield*` inside a try-region** — clean #680 CE refusal
  (`generators-native.ts`, the `unwind.some(e => e.kind !== "replay")` bail in
  `emitYield`'s asterisk branch). Needs the delegation states to observe the
  resume mode so an abrupt can route into the region.
- **`return` inside a try whose finally is STATE-LOWERED** (yielding finally) —
  clean #680 CE refusal (the `unwind.some(e => e.kind === "finally")` bail in
  the `isReturnStatement` branch). This is the return-through-a-suspending-
  finally path; #2906 3c-ii-b solved the analogous async case.

## Slice routing after D2 (what remains where)

All remaining carrier work is tracked in OTHER issues: D3 general-iterable
`yield*` close → #2173 slice-2b; D4 try/catch-across-yield → #2906 3c planner
convergence; IR-lane `gen.setReturn` → #2951; boxed-any resume bindings (F1c)
→ blocked on #2151; spread/`Array.from` precision for the boxed-any carrier —
small, unowned, listed in F1's deferred notes. This issue stays open only as
the umbrella record for those pointers.

### Composition with #3032 lazy-first-resume thunks

Disjoint lanes, one destination. The thunk model is the JS-HOST answer for
expression/nested/method generators (eager buffer made lazy at creation); the
native carrier is standalone-only (`noJsHostTarget`) and already truly lazy —
nothing runs until the first resume, `return()`/`throw()` before start never
run the body (F2), matching the thunk model's §27.5.3.2 behavior. No gating
interaction exists today (verified: R1 touches only the native path; js-host
bytes identical). The composition rules:

- **#3032 W3 route (b) (#2203 capture slots in the state struct) is the
  preferred endgame** over widening route (a) thunk-wraps: every generator
  family that becomes a native candidate exits the buffer model entirely
  (and with it the thunk hack) in standalone; W6 then widens the native
  carrier to js-host, retiring both.
- **Do not add new eager-buffer capabilities** beyond the #2951 IR
  `gen.setReturn` unblock (needed for the IR-first flip in the js-host lane
  regardless of W6 timing).
- Any future js-host widening of the native carrier must preserve #3032's
  observable contract: creation runs nothing; `next(v)` two-way communication
  (impossible under the buffer) comes free with the carrier.

## Wave-2 adoption + re-triage plan (fable, 2026-08-15, #4444 session)

Stale-lane adoption per project-lead direction (prior claim `dev-opus5-gen`
inactive since 2026-07-24; re-claimed by `claude/es6-team-generators` with
--force on origin/issue-assignments; same for #2906/`dev-laneB`).

The ES2015 standalone bucket still carries **~500 generator-attributed
non-passes** (2026-08-15 baseline, `.tmp/es6-standalone-clusters.ts`): ~313
runtime/leak failures mentioning `__gen_*`/`__create_generator` host imports
across `language/{expressions,statements}/generators`, class gen-methods,
object gen-shorthand and for-of; plus ~96 CEs "native generator lowering
currently supports only sequential numeric yields" concentrated in
`language/expressions/yield` (46) and assignment (12).

Given F1/F1b/F2/D2/D4 are landed and the residual work was routed out (see
"Slice routing after D2"), the burn-down is a **candidate-gate widening +
routed-slice execution** problem, not a new-machine problem:

1. **Triage first (mandatory)**: sample 10 representative failures per family
   on CURRENT main and classify: (a) body-shape not yet a native-carrier
   candidate (gate refusal → which check), (b) carrier candidate but wrong
   semantics, (c) routed-slice gap (#2173-2b yield*-close, #2906-3c
   try/catch-across-yield planner, #2951 IR gen.setReturn, F1c boxed-any
   resume bindings), (d) reflection/#2175. Record the counts table here.
2. **Widen the candidate gate** for the largest (a) family — the
   "sequential numeric yields" refusal message marks the legacy pre-carrier
   lowering; find why those bodies don't route to the F1 boxed-any carrier
   (expression-position generators? method generators? see #3032's
   composition note above — W3 route (b) capture slots is the preferred
   endgame).
3. **Execute the routed slices** blocking (c), smallest first; spread/
   `Array.from` precision for the boxed-any carrier is named small + unowned.
4. Class gen-methods + object gen-shorthand (~90 combined) likely share one
   creation-site gate — check `isGenerator` routing for method bodies.

Validation: `TEST262_TARGET=standalone TEST262_PATH_FILTER="language/expressions/generators|language/statements/generators|language/expressions/yield" pnpm run test:262`
+ gc control; equivalence guard; per-slice unit tests. Do NOT regress the
js-host eager-buffer lane (#3032 contract: js-host bytes identical unless
deliberately widening W6).

### Step 1 — mandatory re-triage (measured 2026-08-15, generators lane)

**Artifact**: a full scoped standalone run of the plan's own filter, executed by
this lane on worktree `agent-abc7a54c612648f57` (base = `9e17d34f3`, whose
compiler tree is identical to `a89bc2ff`'s — the latter is docs-only). Not
inherited from `.tmp/es6-standalone-clusters.ts`; the numbers below differ from
the plan's framing above and **supersede it**.

`benchmarks/results/test262-standalone-results-20260815-174617.jsonl`,
610 rows: **404 pass · 103 fail · 102 CE · 1 compile-timeout (66.2 %)**.

| directory                        | pass | non-pass |
| -------------------------------- | ---: | -------: |
| `language/expressions/generators` |  205 |       84 |
| `language/statements/generators`  |  195 |       61 |
| `language/expressions/yield`      |    4 |       59 |
| `annexB/language/expressions`     |    0 |        2 |

Family classification of the 206 non-passes (a/b/c/d per the plan's step 1):

| # | family                                                       | class | count |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ----: |
| 1 | `#680` CE refusal — plan bail ("only sequential numeric yields") | (a)   |    57 |
| 2 | other semantic fail (heterogeneous tail)                        | (b)   |    35 |
| 3 | **terminal `{value: undefined}` value-rep**                     | (b)   |    34 |
| 4 | host-import leak (candidate-gate refusal, `__gen_*`)            | (a)   |    31 |
| 5 | reflection / prototype / brand                                  | (d)   |    21 |
| 6 | iterator + destructuring drive (`Cannot destructure 'null'`)    | (c)   |    13 |
| 7 | parser: `yield` as identifier in sloppy mode                    | (a)   |    11 |
| 8 | other CE                                                        | (a)   |     3 |
| 9 | compile timeout (`yield-weak-binding.js`)                       | (a)   |     1 |

Two corrections to the plan's framing, both load-bearing for routing:

- The ~313 "runtime/leak failures mentioning `__gen_*`" is **31** here, not 313:
  most of that leak family already routes natively. The plan's counts were taken
  over the whole ES2015 bucket, this table over the plan's own validation filter.
- The largest **semantics** family is not a gate-widening problem at all —
  family 3, the terminal `{value: undefined, done: true}` read, is a
  value-REPRESENTATION defect in code the carrier already handles. It is
  invisible to the gate-widening plan because those generators compile
  host-free and *look* supported. Slice S1 below fixes it.

`language/expressions/yield` is the concentration (4/63 passing) and is
dominated by families 1 and 3.

## S1 — terminal `{value: undefined, done: true}` reads as NaN / null (landed here)

**Scope:** an exhausted or `done`-completing native generator now delivers an
observable `undefined` in `.value`, in both carriers, at every consuming
context. Before: `assert.sameValue(result.value, undefined)` — the single most
common assertion in the generator suites — reported `SameValue(«NaN»,
«undefined»)` (f64 carrier) or `SameValue(«null», «undefined»)` (boxed-any
carrier). Host-free and silent; the generator machinery itself was correct.

Verify-first, `--target standalone`, zero host imports, six-file probe over
`language/expressions/yield`: **0/6 → 4/6** (`captured-free-vars`, `from-catch`,
`formal-parameters`, `formal-parameters-after-reassignment-strict`). The two
that remain are different bugs (family 2: an `arguments`-object read, and
parameter reassignment not observed across a suspend).

**Final S1+S2 scoped run** (re-run cleanly after a tree-drift incident, see
below): on the 610 files present in both runs, **404 → 422 pass, net +18, ZERO
regressions**. One of the 18 — `expressions/generators/yield-weak-binding.js` —
was a `compile_timeout` in the base run and is the known load-flaky slow
negative-parse file (it flipped the OTHER way in an intermediate run), so the
**attributable figure is 17, with one flake in our favour**.

> **Tree-drift incident, recorded because the lesson generalises.** An earlier
> "S1+S2" run measured a tree in which S2 had been silently REVERTED: the

The S1-only measurement, for the record: on the 578 files common to that pair,
**374 → 389 pass, net +15**, 17 fixed:
`expressions/yield/{from-catch, from-try, captured-free-vars, formal-parameters,
formal-parameters-after-reassignment-strict, rhs-iter, star-array}`,
`expressions/generators/{return, no-yield, yield-as-statement, yield-newline,
yield-as-property-name, yield-star-before-newline}`,
`statements/generators/{return, yield-as-statement, yield-newline,
yield-as-property-name}`.

Two files show `compile_timeout` in the after-run
(`statements/generators/{yield-star-after-newline, yield-weak-binding}.js`) and
are **not** regressions: run in-process against the BASE tree they fail
identically, and `yield-weak-binding` was itself a timeout in the BASE run.
They are slow negative-parse tests (BASE `compile_ms` 17,584) that flip on
machine load.

**js-host / #3032 contract, proven not asserted.** 9-program × 3-lane sha256
matrix, BASE vs NEW by file-copy A/B: the **gc lane is 9/9 byte-identical**.
Only standalone + wasi move, and only for the 2 programs that actually produce
or read a generator absent value (boxed-any carrier; dynamic `.value` read).
Numeric / string / delegating / spilling / try-catch generators, a plain
function, and a NON-generator `o.value` read are byte-identical in all three
lanes — so the Phase-3 narrowing change does not touch ordinary property reads.

**Equivalence guard.** Scoped subset (31 files: generators / iterators / yield /
destructuring / spread / for-of / optional / nullish) — 3 failed / 200 passed,
all three **pre-existing**, each confirmed by re-running on the BASE tree. (The
full `tests/equivalence` suite OOMed twice on this shared 4-core box, so the
scoped subset is what was actually run.)

**Cleanup candidate, deliberately NOT taken in this batch** —
`tests/equivalence/yield-as-expression.test.ts` > "yield with value used as
expression" fails to COMPILE its test program:
`L3: Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'`. That is a correct TS
diagnostic about the test's own annotation: `Generator<T, TReturn, TNext>` with
`Generator<number, number, undefined>` types `yield 10` as `undefined`, so
`const x: number = yield 10` cannot typecheck. Node never type-checks, which is
why it "works" at runtime. Verified pre-existing by an exact pre-change-main
repro (base src + base test file → identical failure, identical message), and it
is a committed known failure in `scripts/equivalence-baseline.json`, so the
equivalence gate is green on it. Fix is a one-line annotation
(`Generator<number, number, number>`, or drop the `: number`) — out of scope
here because it is pre-existing and baselined, not because it is hard.

Two OTHER assertions in the same file were changed, and the reason belongs here
rather than in a commit message: "yield without
value used as IIFE argument" and "bare yield as function argument" asserted
`typeof result.value === "number"` on a DONE result, which pinned the
SENTINEL'S RENDERING rather than behaviour. Node returns `43` / `5` there; we
have never delivered the `.next(v)` sent value into an ARGUMENT-position yield,
so that value was always the undefined sentinel — it merely used to read back
as the number NaN and satisfy the check by accident. The assertions now pin
`result.done`, true in every model, and the real gap is named in the test. This
is the residual R1 above already says not to pin.

### Why these decisions (root cause, not symptom)

Two independent producers of "absent value", each undone by a different
consumer:

- **f64 carrier — the brand, not the box.** `UNDEF_F64_BITS` already meant
  `undefined` in the `value` slot (#2979), and the dynamic member-get dispatcher
  already resurrected it. But `tryCompileNativeGeneratorResultProperty`'s
  `valueStaticNumeric` fast path returns a bare `f64`, on the reasoning "an
  exhausted read yields NaN, which is the spec ToNumber(undefined)" — true in a
  NUMERIC context, and the harness's context is `any`. The generic
  f64→externref box then applied `__box_number`, and #3315's note says it MUST:
  an arbitrary sentinel-patterned f64 is a computed NaN (`Math.abs` preserves
  the payload) and boxing it to `undefined` regressed the JS-host `log2`
  assertions. That note also names the correct seam — "dedicated
  identity-carrying-slot boxing sites". So the fix is a structural **BRAND** on
  the carrier, `{kind:"f64", undefSentinel:true}`, exactly like #1788's
  `boolean` / #2785's `symbol` on `i32`: every `.kind === "f64"` check still
  matches (numeric codegen byte-identical), and only `coerceType(f64 →
  externref)` consults it. Generic f64 boxing is untouched.
- **boxed-any carrier — `ref.null.extern` is `null`, not `undefined`.** F1's
  note called the null externref "already the canonical undefined"; that was
  inherited from the pre-#2106 model and is no longer true. The tag-1
  `$undefined` singleton is reserved in EVERY standalone/native-strings module
  (`ensureAnyValueType`'s S1.0 reservation), independently of the default-OFF
  `undefinedSingleton` flag, and the value model already separates the two —
  measured host-free: `undefined === null` is **false**, `typeof null` is
  `"object"`, and an unpassed argument is `SameValue`-equal to `undefined`. So
  `defaultElemValueInstrs` was minting JS **null**. Confirmed directly on
  `formal-parameters.js`'s shape: `result.value === null` true, `typeof`
  `"object"`.
- **One canonical producer.** `canonicalUndefinedExternInstrs(ctx)`
  (any-helpers.ts) is the lane-correct `undefined` and is deliberately NOT gated
  on the `undefinedSingleton` flag — `undefinedExternInstrs` is, which is why
  every caller silently fell back to `ref.null.extern`. Host lane keeps
  `__get_undefined` (a null externref surfaces as JS `null` there); the lookup
  is `funcMap.get` only, so no late import is registered mid-body.

### Not the fix (checked and rejected, recorded so it is not re-tried)

The Phase-3 (#1269) consumer-side narrowing in `property-access-dispatch.ts`
lacked the #2979 generator-sentinel exception that `fillMemberGetDispatch`,
`planGeneric`, `planTypedF64` and `member-set-f64` all carry, so it unboxed the
dispatcher's canonicalized `undefined` back through `__unbox_number`. That IS a
real hole and is closed here too — but closing it alone changed nothing on the
real tests, because the harness shape never reaches that path (`objType` is the
narrowed `IteratorResult`, so the read goes through
`tryCompileNativeGeneratorResultProperty`). Fixing the visible-in-a-probe path
and declaring victory would have been the failure mode; the probe had to be
built from the ACTUAL assembled harness before the real producer showed up.

### Files (S1)

- `src/ir/types.ts` — `undefSentinel?: true` brand on the `f64` ValType.
- `src/codegen/any-helpers.ts` — `canonicalUndefinedExternInstrs`.
- `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` — brand-aware f64→externref box.
- `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` — `defaultElemValueInstrs` /
  `emptyResult` / `emptyResultForType` take `ctx`; externref carrier default is
  the canonical `undefined`.
- `src/codegen/generators-native-consumer.ts` — brand the
  `valueStaticNumeric` read result.
- `src/codegen/property-access-dispatch.ts` — Phase-3 narrowing skips
  generator-sentinel candidates.
- `src/codegen/member-get-dispatch.ts` — the dynamic dispatcher's sentinel arm
  uses the canonical producer (this is the site that served the read in a
  module without full `$AnyValue` wiring).
- `tests/issue-2864-s1-terminal-undefined.test.ts` — 5 standalone cases
  (zero-host-import asserted), including the NEGATIVE case: a generator that
  yields a genuine `0/0` must still read as a NUMBER, so the brand cannot
  swallow #3315's computed-NaN.

### Tracked residual — `.next(v)` sent value not bound in ARGUMENT position

Surfaced by S1 and kept here deliberately so de-pinning the two
`yield-as-expression` assertions does not lose it. `function* gen(){ return
identity(yield) }` + `it.next(); it.next(5)` returns **`undefined`** where Node
returns `5`: an argument-position `yield` gets no resume binding, so the slot
keeps the undefined sentinel. Before S1 this read back as the number NaN, which
is why a `typeof … === "number"` assertion passed over it for so long — that
check could not distinguish Node's `5` from our sentinel, since both are
numbers. S1 did not change the behaviour, only stopped it from being disguised.

Same root as slice 3 below (a yield in a nested expression position is not a
suspend point the planner binds), and the same class as the R1 `.next()`-with-
no-arg residual. Fixing it is part of the nested-yield slice, not of the carrier.

## S2 — generator × `arguments`: a green compile that the ENGINE REJECTS (landed here)

**The headline is not a conformance delta — it is a JS-HOST correctness fix that
the standalone numbers cannot show.** On the gc lane,
`function* g(a,b){ const n = arguments.length; yield n }` compiled *successfully*
and produced a module WebAssembly refuses to load:
`global.set[0] expected type externref, found i32.const of type i32`. Isolated:
a NON-generator reading `arguments` is valid, and a generator NOT reading it is
valid — it is specifically generator × `arguments`. In standalone the same shape
was a raw wasm trap at the FIRST `arguments` read, i.e. before any suspend, so
it was never a suspend-crossing problem.

### Root cause

The native state struct has slots for `this`, own params and spilled locals. The
RESUME function compiles the body with a FRESH `FunctionContext`, and the
§10.2.11 arguments-vec setup in `function-body.ts` runs against the FACTORY's
context only — so `arguments` resolves to nothing in the resume body.

**The bail already existed for the two other generator forms** — generator
EXPRESSIONS (`isNativeGeneratorExpressionShape`) and generator METHODS (whose
arm names this exact reason) — and was simply never applied to free function
DECLARATIONS. #3032 W6 then routed those natively on the JS-host lane too,
which is how a standalone-only trap became an invalid module on the default lane.
One check, moved to the shared part of `isNativeGeneratorCandidate`, so all three
forms agree.

### Re-triage correction — this family is 2 tests, not ~7

The routed list below originally estimated ~7 tests from the family label. Built
NON-generator twins for each and measured; five are not generator defects:

| test(s)                                   | verdict                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arguments-object-attributes`, `formal-parameters-after-reassignment-non-strict` | **generator-specific** — this slice |
| `params-dflt-ref-arguments`               | `arguments[i]` in a param DEFAULT is broken for plain functions too — general, out of lane |
| `arguments-with-arguments-{fn,lex}` ×2 dirs | fails on `typeof <captured arguments>`; the non-generator twin also fails (differently). Reflection/`typeof` class → #2175 |

`arguments` in a param default DOES work for generators (verified against Node),
so that half of the family was never broken here.

### Measured

- JS-host: invalid module → **valid module, correct value (2)**, both before and
  after a yield. A generator NOT reading `arguments` still routes natively (no
  `__gen_*` imports) — the bail's blast radius is pinned by a test.
- standalone: the 2 in-lane tests go `fail` (trap) → `compile_error` (clean #680
  refusal). **Conformance-neutral by design**; a refusal is the correct answer
  until the frame carries `arguments`, and it replaces a trap.
- `tests/issue-2864-s2-generator-arguments.test.ts`: 5/5.

**#3032 contract exception, stated rather than glossed:** host bytes DO change
for these programs. The contract cannot apply — the bytes being replaced are an
invalid module, so there is no valid baseline to preserve.

### The real fix, banked

Making `arguments` work in the frame: the factory builds the vec at CALL time
(§10.2.11, where the spec puts it), spills it as a synthetic `arguments` spill
(the F1b typed-spill machinery already carries vec refs); the resume function
reloads it into an `arguments` local; and MAPPED aliasing
(`arguments[0] = 32` writing back to param `a`, which
`formal-parameters-after-reassignment-non-strict` needs) requires
`fctx.mappedArgsInfo` rebuilt against the frame rather than the factory locals.
Three sites in the most byte-stability-sensitive file for a 2-test payoff — worth
doing after the higher-count slices, not before.

### Next slices (routed on the measured triage, not started)

1. ~~**`arguments` inside a native generator** (~7)~~ — **S2 above**. The
   admission bail is fixed (green-compile-invalid-module on the JS-host lane);
   the frame-carrying implementation is banked, and the family re-scoped to 2.
2. **Self-name reference in a named generator EXPRESSION** (~9:
   `named-*-reassign-fn-name-in-body*`, `scope-name-var-*`). One gate check —
   `isNativeGeneratorExpressionShape`'s self-name bail — blocks all of them.
3. **Nested-yield expression positions** — measured design note below.

## S3 design note — yield POSITION admission (measured, not implemented)

The coordinator's instruction for this slice was to scope the convergence
honestly rather than force a point fix, so this is a measured trigger list plus
a design, with no code change.

### What the planner actually admits

`lowerStatements` recognises a suspend at exactly **two** syntactic positions —
`yield e;` as an ExpressionStatement, and `let x = yield e;` as a
single-declarator VariableStatement. Every other statement containing a yield
falls through to `fail()`. Probed on current main (untyped JS, standalone,
which is the test262 shape):

| shape                                | result | why |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ---- |
| `yield;` bare statement              | works  | the ExpressionStatement arm |
| `(yield);` parenthesised             | **CE** | the arm tests `isYieldExpression(stmt.expression)`; a `ParenthesizedExpression` is not one. A one-line unwrap. |
| `const t = yield; return t;`         | **CE** | the declaration arm is reached, but an operand-LESS yield has no resolvable carrier (`isNumericExpression(undefined)`) |
| `t = yield;` (assignment)            | **CE** | no assignment arm at all |
| `return identity(yield);`            | **CE** | yield in argument position AND `yieldValueOk` rejects a call as the return expression |

So admission is restricted on **two independent axes** — the yield's syntactic
POSITION and the accepted RETURN-expression shape — and the CE message
("only sequential numeric yields") names neither.

### Measured trigger list

Of the 57 `#680` CE refusals in the triage, **38 are `star-rhs-iter-*` /
`yield*`** and belong to #2173 slice-2b. Of the remaining 19:

- **~7 are true nested-yield**: `rhs-primitive`, `rhs-omitted`,
  `rhs-template-middle`, `rhs-regexp`, `in-rltn-expr`,
  `iter-value-{specified,unspecified}`, `yield-as-literal-property-name`.
- **8 are `dstr/*-fn-name-{gen,class}`** — a destructuring default whose
  initializer is a nested class/generator expression; a different bail.
- `from-with` (`with`), `scope-param-rest-elem-var-*` (rest params — an
  explicit gate bail).

So this slice is ~7 tests, not ~10 — and the `dstr` group should be re-triaged
separately rather than counted here.

### Two candidate designs

**(a) ANF normalisation before planning** — rewrite a statement containing a
nested yield into the shapes the planner already admits
(`return identity(yield)` → `const t = yield; return identity(t)`), then plan as
today. Attractive because it needs no new machinery, and it would also close the
tracked `.next(v)`-in-argument-position residual above.

**The constraint that makes it non-trivial, and that a naive hoist gets wrong:
evaluation ORDER.** Operands to the LEFT of the yield must be evaluated BEFORE
the suspend and operands to the right after it, so hoisting the yield requires
hoisting every earlier sub-expression into temps in source order. Verified
against Node: for `two((log += "L", 1), yield)`, `log` is already `"L"` when the
generator suspends. A rewrite that evaluates the left operand after the resume
is silently wrong in exactly the way this issue's history keeps warning about, so
this design is only safe with a real effect-ordering pass — not a pattern match
on the common cases.

**(b) Route these shapes to the #2906 CFG planner**, which models suspension as
a terminator on a control-flow graph and therefore does not care about syntactic
position. This is the convergence trigger the "Alignment decision" section above
already anticipates ("new control-flow capability → CFG planner; carrier /
value-rep capability → generators-native").

**Recommendation: (b), and this is the trigger.** Yield-position admission is a
control-flow capability, not a carrier one — it is precisely the case the
alignment rule reserves for the CFG planner. (a) would work for the simplest
files and would then need the same effect-ordering machinery the CFG path
already has to build, so it buys a handful of tests and a second place to get
ordering wrong.

**One exception worth taking independently of (a)/(b):** the
`ParenthesizedExpression` unwrap in the ExpressionStatement arm. It is a
one-line, order-neutral admission fix (`(yield)` is exactly `yield`), and it is
measured above as a real CE today. It does not commit the lane to either design.

Out of this lane on the measured evidence: `star-rhs-iter-*` (~35) → #2173
slice-2b; `prototype-*` / brand (~21) → #2175; `unscopables-with*` (4) → `with`;
sloppy-mode `yield`-as-identifier (11) → parser.

## ES2015 authoritative closeout handoff (2026-08-26)

The complete standalone ES2015 run `20260826-194014` provides a current exact
denominator across the authoritative 11,704-row filter. Exactly **297/11,704**
rows are generator-carrier compile errors owned by this umbrella:

- 104/297 report that native generator lowering supports only sequential
  numeric yields;
- 193/297 emit forbidden standalone imports containing
  `__create_generator` or `__gen_*`;
- the corresponding host rows are 143 pass and 154 fail, so host success is a
  required control but not an oracle for the standalone implementation.

Source artifacts:

- `/private/tmp/js2-es6-authoritative-measure4/benchmarks/results/test262-standalone-results-20260826-194014.jsonl`
- `/private/tmp/js2-es6-authoritative-measure3/benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260826-180615.jsonl`

### Closeout implementation plan

1. Materialize the exact 297-path list from the standalone JSONL and group it
   by native-plan refusal versus emitted import set; do not use filename-only
   generator classification.
2. Reduce one representative per distinct plan refusal/import set and route it
   through the existing F1/F2/D2/D4 carrier before adding new machinery.
3. Check the routed child issues named above first (#2173, #2175, #2906 and the
   parser handoff); update those issue files when a row belongs there instead
   of duplicating implementation in this umbrella.
4. Implement and checkpoint the largest proven shared gate, with standalone
   semantic pins plus host controls. No host import, skip, fixture rewrite, or
   oracle-only fallback is acceptable.
5. Rerun all 297 standalone rows and their 297 host controls, record exact
   pass/fail/compile-error counts, and integrate the checkpoint into the sole
   upstream draft PR #5010.

## 2026-09-03 re-measurement of the 297-row checkpoint — now 233 rows, and the cross-cluster leverage

Filed by the #4444 ES2015 closeout lane, not by this issue's owner: this lane
is CLAIMED by `claude/es6-team-generators` (claim ref, since 2026-08-15) and is
demonstrably live (`src/codegen/generators-native.ts` last moved on `main` at
085ad75506 and 5890005e85, 2026-09-01), so nothing here is an attempt to take
it over. It is a measurement handed to the owner, plus the reason it matters
more than its own cluster suggests.

**The 2026-08-26 checkpoint's 297 is now 233.** Same exact-text predicate (the
sequential-numeric refusal, or a `__create_generator` / `__gen_*` token),
re-run against the standalone baseline fetched 2026-09-03 08:13 UTC (rows
stamped 09:07 UTC, `oracle_lane: "honest"`, so post-#5461 leak-checked) crossed
with the ES2015 edition map. **64 rows cleared** since the checkpoint. All 233
are still `compile_error`.

| kind | rows | 08-26 | Δ |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| carrier / import leak | 137 | 193 | −56 |
| native-plan refusal (sequential numeric yields) | 95 | 104 | −9 |
| `wasm_compile` naming `__gen_resume_g` | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| **total** | **233** | **297** | **−64** |

**The part that is easy to miss from inside this issue: only 46 of the 233 are
in the generators cluster.** The rest sit in other clusters' residual lists,
where the lane that owns the cluster cannot fix them:

| cluster | generator-blocked rows | that cluster's total non-pass |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| expressions | 91 | 244 |
| generators | 46 | 121 |
| class | 45 | 191 |
| for-of + collections | 35 | 101 |
| statements + lang | 13 | 75 |
| module-code | 2 | 25 |
| proxy + reflect | 1 | 157 |

So this one lane gates **233 of the 1,756 remaining ES2015 standalone rows
(13.3%), and 59% of all 391 compile_errors** — by a wide margin the largest
single lever left toward the 100% goal, and larger than any whole cluster.
Concretely: `language/expressions` cannot get past ~63% until this lands, no
matter what the expressions lane does, because 91 of its 244 residual rows are
this refusal.

Two consequences for whoever picks this up:

- **The cluster r3 plans being written today (typedarray, class, proxy+reflect,
  array+object, promise, for-of) must EXCLUDE these rows from what they claim**,
  or six plans will each promise rows only this lane can deliver. The
  per-cluster path lists are in `.tmp/census0903/`; the 233 are isolated in
  `.tmp/census0903/_gen.tsv`.
- **The two biggest signature groups are still the two the checkpoint named.**
  94 rows carry the canonical sequential-numeric refusal (the C01 group, which
  the checkpoint already warned is a signature and not a bucket), and 137 carry
  a carrier/import leak whose largest variants differ only in which `__gen_*`
  helpers the module reached for. The `## S3 design note — yield POSITION
  admission (measured, not implemented)` in this file is the piece that the
  94-row group is waiting on.

Reproduce: `.tmp/census0903/census.mjs`, then
`grep -aE '__create_generator|__gen_|native generator lowering' .tmp/census0903/*.tsv`.

## ES2015 exact 297-row classification checkpoint (2026-08-26)

This is the first closeout checkpoint from the authoritative ES2015 run. It is classification-only: no candidate gate was widened and no standalone result was credited without a host control. The next implementation checkpoint must start from the reduced groups below.

**Inputs**: standalone `/private/tmp/js2-es6-authoritative-measure4/benchmarks/results/test262-standalone-results-20260826-194014.jsonl` and host `/private/tmp/js2-es6-authoritative-measure3/benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260826-180615.jsonl`; each contains exactly 11,704 unique rows. Selection is an exact text predicate over `error`/`error_signature`: the sequential-numeric native-generator refusal, or a `__create_generator`/`__gen_*` token. It selects 297 rows, all `compile_error`.

| population | standalone rows | host pass | host fail | accounting |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| native-plan refusal | 104 | 21 | 83 | 102 rows with the canonical refusal plus 2 rows with a second/combined refusal signature |
| carrier/import family | 193 | 122 | 71 | 192 explicit `host_import_leak` rows plus 1 `wasm_compile` row whose exact signature names `__gen_resume_g` |
| **total** | **297** | **143** | **154** | **297/11,704 standalone compile errors** |

The 143/154 host split is a control denominator, not a standalone oracle: host success proves that a source shape can execute in the host model, while host failure identifies a shape that needs separate semantic triage. The one `__gen_resume_g` row is retained in the authoritative 193-row carrier family so the 297 denominator is conserved, but it is explicitly not called an emitted host import.

### Reduced exact-signature groups

Groups are keyed by the full `error_signature` string from the JSONL. Representatives are reduction points, not claims that every path in a group has the same root cause; the route text is a handoff hypothesis to validate against source and a focused semantic pin. The visible `␠` in C14 marks one trailing U+0020 in the source signature so the manifest remains whitespace-clean.

### Checkpoint handoff

- The largest measured candidate is **C02: 57 rows, 54/57 host-pass controls**. Its paths are not one proven gate: 30 are under `arguments-object`, with the remainder split across dstr/default/self-name/method shapes. The existing arguments bail is correctness-preserving; implementing frame-carried `arguments` is the next standalone-capable slice.
- The largest native-refusal group is **C01: 102 rows**, but only 21/102 host-pass controls. It mixes delegation, dstr iterator-close, nested-yield position, computed-name, and arguments shapes. It must not be widened as one bucket.
- Child routing is explicit: delegation/iterator-close → #2173; reflective/prototype receiver shapes → #2175; new control-flow/yield-position shapes → #2906; frame arguments and named-expression self-binding remain #2864 follow-ups.
- No host import, skip, fixture, or oracle workaround was introduced in this checkpoint. A subsequent implementation must add standalone semantic pins and rerun all 297 rows plus all 297 host controls before claiming a delta.

### C02 frame-carried `arguments` implementation checkpoint (2026-08-27)

The first bounded C02 slice is now implemented and independently verified. It
covers the exact **30/57** `arguments-object` rows in the C02 manifest:

| shape | rows | standalone | host control |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| class declaration generator methods (instance/static) | 10 | 10 pass | 10 pass |
| class expression generator methods (instance/static) | 10 | 10 pass | 10 pass |
| generator function expressions | 5 | 5 pass | 5 pass |
| object-literal generator methods | 5 | 5 pass | 5 pass |
| **bounded C02 slice** | **30** | **30 pass** | **30 pass** |

The targeted loop used the exact paths in
`/private/tmp/js2-2864-c02-arguments-paths.txt`, `wrapTest`, and the existing
`CompilerPool` unified worker with one worker (within the requested two-worker
ceiling). A standalone `runTest` pass includes the existing zero-host-import
gate; therefore these 30 rows produced no `__create_generator`/`__gen_*`
imports. The corresponding host controls all reached the test body and passed.
The authoritative C02 denominator remains 57 rows (54/57 host-pass controls);
the other 27 rows remain the dstr/default/self-name follow-ups and are not
credited to this slice.

Root cause and fix:

- `NativeGeneratorInfo` now records an optional frame `arguments` field, its
  canonical vec type, source-parameter offset, and mapped-arguments flag.
- `compileNativeGeneratorFunction` stores the factory's eagerly-created
  arguments vec in that field. `ensureNativeGeneratorResumeFunction` reloads
  it into the detached resume context before body compilation and rebuilds
  `mappedArgsInfo` against the resume parameter indices.
- Generator-specific parameter and spill offsets advance past the optional
  field; ordinary generators retain the historical layout. The candidate gate
  admits this bounded arguments shape while retaining the existing super,
  capture, rest/default, and plan bails.

Focused semantic pins in
`tests/issue-2864-s2-generator-arguments.test.ts` cover free declarations,
call-site extras, function expressions, object/class methods,
resume-after-yield, mapped writes, and a JS-host control. The focused suite is
**10/10 green**; the related native-generator regression set is **62 passed,
3 skipped** (the skips are the pre-existing #3591 stale module-init state
cases).

Static checks are green after the issue's intentional budget grants:

- `node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit --pretty false`
- `SKIP_SLOW_PRECOMMIT=1 pnpm run check:loc-budget`
- `SKIP_SLOW_PRECOMMIT=1 pnpm run check:func-budget`

This is a bounded acceptance checkpoint, not closure of the umbrella: C02's
remaining 27 rows, C01's 102 native-plan refusals, and the other carrier groups
remain routed to their documented follow-ups.

Handoff: commit `aa5e2aef6b3cbbd6f6774dd351c14c2a0fd9c597` on
`codex/2864-es2015-generator-closeout` contains this implementation and is
intended for existing draft PR [#5035](https://github.com/loopdive/js2/pull/5035).
The local push was attempted after verification but was denied by the execution
environment's external-egress policy; the parent integration task must push this
fast-forward checkpoint to the PR branch. The worktree has no tracked or
dependency-artifact residue.

### PR #5035 merge-result regression repair

The first upstream quality run exposed two JS-host-only invalid modules after
merging current `main`: both focused host controls failed because the native
generator factory's already-emitted `arguments` prologue retained stale global
indices while the detached resume-function build registered late host imports.
The standalone controls stayed green because that lane adds no host imports.

`compileNativeGeneratorFunction` now registers the not-yet-attached factory
body in `ctx.liveBodies` for exactly the duration of
`ensureNativeGeneratorResumeFunction`. The shared late-index shifter therefore
updates the arguments prologue along with the detached resume body, and the
registration is removed in `finally` without leaking a live body. After the
latest upstream merge, the focused suite is again 10/10, including both
JS-host validation failures and all standalone controls. PR #5035 remains
draft until the refreshed upstream quality run passes.

## RE-MEASURED 2026-09-18 — the premise above is stale, and the gap is far narrower

Everything above was measured 2026-06-30. Re-measured on `origin/main`
`278b5d1aa5`, `--target standalone`, `result.imports === []` asserted on every
probe. **A general native carrier now exists.** All of these lower natively with
zero host imports:

| shape | result |
| --- | --- |
| named generator declaration | works |
| anonymous generator expression `function*(){}` | works |
| named generator expression | works |
| class generator method | works |
| string yields | works |
| `for` loop containing a yield | works |
| sent values — `const a = yield 1; …` then `it.next(5)` | works |
| `yield*` delegation | works |
| array / object / nested / rest destructuring **inside** a generator body | works |
| a ref-typed local (array, object, string) live **across** a yield | works |

So "only sequential numeric yields" is no longer the boundary, and the
architecture-scale framing above (CPS transform / stack-switching) is **not**
what this issue needs. Do not start there.

### The measured boundary

These leak `__gen_create_buffer` / `__gen_push_f64` / `__gen_push_ref` /
`__create_generator`:

```ts
function* g() { let a;  [a] = [yield 1];            yield a; }   // yield in an array-dstr RHS
function* g() { let a;  ({a} = {a: yield 1});       yield a; }   // yield in an obj-dstr RHS
function* g() { const [a = yield 1] = [];           yield a; }   // yield as a dstr DEFAULT
function* g() { const v = yield 1; const [a] = [v]; yield a; }   // dstr anywhere + a sent-value yield
function* g() { const arr = [yield 1];              yield arr[0]; } // yield inside an ARRAY LITERAL — no dstr at all
```

These do not:

```ts
function* g() { const a = yield 1;   yield a + 1; }   // sent value, plain identifier binding
function* g() { const [a] = [5];     yield a; }       // destructuring, no sent-value yield
```

**The last leaking case is the important one: it contains no destructuring.**
An earlier reading of these rows as "destructuring inside a generator" is
therefore wrong — destructuring on its own is fine, and a bare array literal
holding a yield is not. Whatever the real predicate is, it is a property of the
**statement walker's supported grammar**, not of destructuring.

### Where the predicate actually lives

`src/codegen/generators-native.ts`. The plan builder walks statements and
returns false on any shape it cannot lower; `src/codegen/function-body.ts:688`
turns that into the `#680` diagnostic, and `nativeGeneratorInfoForDecl` (the
#3505 decl-aware lookup) is what the refusal consults. A visible clue at
`generators-native.ts:626-630` — the variable-statement lowering accepts a
declaration list of length 1 whose name is an **Identifier** and whose
initializer is a **YieldExpression**, and nothing else. That is consistent with
every leaking case above, but **read the walker and enumerate the real grammar
rather than trusting this paragraph.**

### Why it matters

130 of the 309 ES2015 non-pass rows that mention a generator report
`standalone target emitted host imports: env::__create_generator`; a further 57
report the `#680` diagnostic. The failing rows are overwhelmingly `dstr/` paths
(`obj-prop-nested-array-yield-expr.js`, `array-rest-nested-array-yield-expr.js`
…) — i.e. destructuring tests whose RHS carries a `yield`, which is exactly the
intersection above.

## Implementation Plan (supersedes the architect-spec plan above)

**S1 — enumerate, then extend.** Read the plan builder's statement/expression
walk and write down every shape it rejects. Extend it so a `yield` is
supported in **expression position** wherever the surrounding statement is
already lowerable: inside an array literal, an object literal, a destructuring
RHS, and a destructuring default. The yield must remain a state-machine
suspension point — the surrounding expression has to be split across the
resume boundary, with the partially-built value spilled to the frame, not
re-evaluated (re-evaluating would repeat observable side effects).

**S2 — the sent-value binding.** Generalise the length-1 / Identifier /
YieldExpression variable-statement rule so a binding pattern is allowed on the
left and a yield may appear anywhere in the initializer.

Keep the slices separate: S1 is the 5-case boundary above, S2 is the
declaration rule. If S1 alone moves the rows, stop and say so.

### Acceptance

1. All five leaking shapes above compile with `result.imports === []` and
   produce the right values, and both working shapes stay working.
2. **Order preservation**: a yield inside a literal must not re-run the
   sibling elements after resume. Pin with a counter — `[f(), yield 1, g()]`
   calls `f` once and `g` once, in that order, across the suspension.
3. Measured on **both** a merge-base tree and the branch, same `.test262-cache`
   symlinked into both: the `language/expressions/assignment/dstr` and
   `language/statements/**/dstr` directories, plus a generator control set.
   **Zero rows lost** — the per-test edition ratchet fails the required check
   on a single pass→not-pass in ES2015, with no waiver.
4. gc/host lane byte-identical (this path is standalone-gated).
5. All gates exit 0, run bare.

### Dead ends — do not re-run these

- **Generator NAME collisions** genuinely break compilation: two `function* g`
  in different scopes give `Internal error: Missing native generator factory
  identity` (and a top-level `g` shadowed by a nested `g` does too). It is a
  real bug worth its own id, but it carries **~0 test262 rows** — the 6 corpus
  matches are the `BindingIdentifier` template placeholder, not real duplicates.
- **Anonymous generator expressions** were ranked the top blocker at 113 rows
  by a regex census. They work fine; the count was matching test262 *template*
  text, not the failing construct.

---

## S1 + S2 IMPLEMENTED 2026-09-18 — and the corpus family is NOT the one the plan aimed at

Branch `claude/es6-2864-generator-carrier`. Everything below is measured on that
branch against a frozen copy of the merge-base tree, both with the same
`test262` submodule and `.test262-cache` symlinked in.

### What the plan builder actually rejects (enumerated, not inferred)

The suggestive spot the re-measurement pointed at (`generators-native.ts`
~L626-630, `tryYieldDeclaration`) is real but is **one of four** refusal sites,
and it is not the one that carries the leaking rows. `lowerStatements` is the
whole grammar. For a statement that CONTAINS a yield it accepts exactly:

1. `return <yield* …>;` (outside a state-lowered finally);
2. `return <yield-free expr>;` when the value matches the carrier and no
   enclosing `finally` is state-lowered;
3. `yield …;` / `yield* …;` as the WHOLE expression statement;
4. `<Identifier> = yield* …;`;
5. `<var|let|const> <Identifier> = <YieldExpression>;` — exactly one declarator,
   an Identifier name, and the initializer must be the yield ITSELF;
6. an `ExpressionStatement`, **only in the direct body statement list**, only
   with an empty unwind chain and an f64 carrier, whose expression is an array
   literal / object literal / comma chain / `cond ? … : …` / `( yield )`
   containing an **operand-less** `yield` (#680);
7. `try` (two regimes), `if`, `while`, `do`, `for`, and a bare block.

Everything else is `fail()`. The consequences worth naming, because each is a
separate piece of work and only the last two were in this slice's scope:

- **no `for-of` / `for-in` branch at all** — a yield anywhere in one bails;
- **no `switch` branch**;
- a yield in **any assignment** (`[a] = [yield]`, `x = yield`, `o.p = yield`,
  `f(yield)`);
- a yield **carrying an operand** anywhere except as a whole statement or a
  whole identifier initializer;
- a declaration whose initializer merely **contains** a yield, or whose name is
  a binding pattern, or which has more than one declarator.

### What landed

`buildNativeGeneratorPlan` only — one file, one function, gated on
`noJsHostTarget(ctx)` so the **gc lane is byte-identical** (see the sha table).

- **S1** — the #680 continuation grammar now admits (a) a `yield` that carries
  an operand, (b) an **assignment** root whose right-hand side suspends, with
  either a destructuring target or a plain identifier target, and (c) a **call**
  as a captured prefix operand.
- **S2** — `lowerDeclarationContinuation`: a single-declarator, identifier-named
  declaration whose initializer suspends. #680's machinery was already
  statement-shaped (a successor state recompiles the ORIGINAL statement with the
  yield and its captured prefix read back from frame spills), so a declaration
  needed a *root*, not a new lowering.

**Why standalone-only.** The host lane keeps a WORKING eager-buffer fallback for
every shape the plan refuses, so admitting more shapes there moves passing rows
onto a different lowering for no conformance gain — pure regression risk.
Standalone has no fallback: a refusal there IS the `#680` diagnostic / the
`env::__gen_*` leak. (The re-measurement's acceptance criterion said "this path
is standalone-gated". It is **not** — since #3032 W6 the host lane routes free
generator declarations through the same planner. The gate had to be added
deliberately; it is what makes criterion 4 true rather than assumed.)

**Why a call is now a safe prefix operand.** #680's comment ("values before a
suspension must not require observable Get/call/spread/key work") reads as a
soundness rule but is a proof-scope one. A captured operand is compiled exactly
once, in the suspending state, and every later state reads its spill through the
planner-validated replacement map. That single evaluation is the property the
order pin needs.

### The five shapes, before → after (standalone, `imports` asserted `[]`)

| shape | base | branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `let a; [a] = [yield 1]; yield a;` | #680 refusal | `imports=[]`, value 7 |
| `let a; ({a} = {a: yield 1}); yield a;` | #680 refusal | `imports=[]`, value 7 |
| `const [a = yield 1] = []; yield a;` | #680 refusal | **still refused** |
| `const v = yield 1; const [a] = [v]; yield a;` | **already worked** | unchanged |
| `const arr = [yield 1]; yield arr[0];` | #680 refusal | `imports=[]`, value 7 |
| control `const a = yield 1; yield a+1;` | worked | unchanged, byte-identical |
| control `const [a] = [5]; yield a;` | worked | unchanged, byte-identical |

Two corrections to the re-measurement:

- **Shape 4 does not reproduce as written.** `const v = yield 1; const [a] = [v];`
  compiles host-free on the BASE tree when the generator is typed. What fails is
  the UNTYPED form — and so does the control `const a = yield 1; yield a+1;`,
  for the same reason: with no annotation the sent value is not `number`, the
  carrier becomes the boxed-any `externref`, and the `carrierIsAny(elemValType)`
  bail on any resume binding (generators-native.ts, the F1 spill-typing loop)
  refuses the generator. That is a different, larger gap than yield-position and
  it is the one that dominates untyped test262 generator code.
- **`const [a = yield 1] = []` is a CONDITIONAL suspension** — the default is
  evaluated only when the element is `undefined`. The continuation model
  suspends UNCONDITIONALLY, so admitting it would yield where the spec does not.
  It is refused on purpose and pinned as such.

### Order preservation

`arr = [f(), yield 1, h()]` — `f` is called exactly once BEFORE the suspension,
`h` exactly once AFTER it, in that order, and the result is `[10, sent, 20]`.
Measured against Node running the same source, and pinned in
`tests/issue-2864-yield-in-expression-position.test.ts` (ORDER cases, plus the
object-literal twin). The pin is not vacuous: on the merge-base tree the file is
**7 failed / 4 passed**; on the branch **11 passed**. The 4 that pass on both are
the three deliberate-refusal cases and the gc-gating case.

### The row finding — S1+S2 move ZERO rows, and the reason is structural

The `dstr` family the re-measurement pointed at is **yield in the destructuring
TARGET**, not in the value:

```
result = [ x = yield ] = vals;      result = [ x[yield] ] = vals;
result = { x = yield } = vals;      result = { x: x[yield] } = vals;
result = [...{ x = yield }] = vals; result = [ {} = yield ] = vals;   …
```

Every one of the 12 `language/expressions/assignment/dstr/*yield-expr.js` files
has this shape, and so does every match of `= [… yield …]` / `= {… yield …}`
across `expressions/assignment/dstr`, `statements/generators`,
`expressions/generators` and `built-ins/GeneratorPrototype` (38 lines, all of
them `result = <pattern-with-yield> = vals`). A corpus-wide scan for the
statement form S1 newly admits — `<identifier> = yield …;` — finds **4 files**,
all of them `yield *` delegations or string operands.

So the two classes are disjoint:

- **value position** (`[a] = [yield 1]`) — what S1/S2 fix, ~0 corpus rows;
- **target position** (`[a = yield] = vals`) — where the ~130 leaking rows are,
  and it needs a *destructuring-aware* lowering: the suspension is either
  conditional (an element default, which only runs when the element is
  `undefined`) or sits inside a member target whose reference is evaluated
  before the iterator step. Neither is expressible by "capture the prefix,
  suspend unconditionally, recompile the statement". Doing it means driving
  `GetIterator` / `IteratorStepValue` explicitly in the state graph and
  branching on the element's undefined-ness — a separate slice, and the honest
  next step for this issue.

`for-of` / `for-in` with a yield in the loop head (the 39 + 14
`statements/*/dstr/*yield*` rows) needs a `for-of` branch in `lowerStatements`
first; there is none today.

### Measured row delta — both trees, identical

Row runner: `COMPILER_POOL_SIZE=2 npx tsx scripts/run-test262-paths.mts <list>
--isolate --standalone`, 969 paths = every `dstr` file mentioning `yield` under
`language/expressions/assignment/dstr` + `language/statements/**/dstr` (337),
plus the whole generator control set (`language/statements/generators`,
`language/expressions/generators`, `built-ins/GeneratorPrototype`,
`built-ins/GeneratorFunction`, 632). Base tree = a frozen copy of the merge-base
(`0d2ef8633f`) with `node_modules` / `test262` / `.test262-cache` symlinked;
branch tree = the same, frozen at the commit measured.

| | base | branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pass | 762 | 762 |
| fail | 76 | 76 |
| compile_error | 131 | 131 |

The comparison is per-TEST, not per-count: `diff` of the two reports' entire
tails — counts, the 207-row non-pass list, and every failure REASON string — is
**empty**. Zero rows lost, zero rows gained.

Zero-lost is also structural, not just observed. The only standalone generators
whose lowering changes are ones the plan previously REFUSED, and a refusal is a
whole-file compile error, so no previously-passing row can change lowering; and
the gc lane is byte-identical, so the host shards cannot move either. The run is
the confirmation, not the argument.

Of the 131 base compile errors, 94 are `standalone target emitted host imports`
and 37 are the `#680` refusal — the two faces of the same bail. None of them is
a shape S1/S2 admit, for the structural reason above: they are yield-in-TARGET,
`for-of`-with-a-yield, or the untyped boxed-any-carrier resume-binding bail.

### gc/host byte-identity

`sha256` of the emitted binary for 18 generator probes compiled on both trees:

- **gc lane — all 18 identical**, including every newly-admitted shape.
- **standalone lane — identical for all 11 probes the change does not admit**
  (`const a = yield 1`, `const [a] = [5]`, the destructuring default, the
  member-assignment target, the nested yield operand, the in-`if` continuation,
  the loop/try/`yield*` generator, the existing #680 bare-yield literal/comma
  shapes, and the two `.return()` / undefined-sent-value controls). Differs
  exactly for the 9 newly-admitted shapes.

### Status

Not done. S1 and S2 landed and are pinned; the row-carrying family
(yield in a destructuring TARGET) and `for-of`/`for-in` with a yield in the loop
head are untouched, and so is the untyped boxed-any-carrier resume-binding bail
that dominates real test262 generator code. Left at `in-progress` on purpose.
