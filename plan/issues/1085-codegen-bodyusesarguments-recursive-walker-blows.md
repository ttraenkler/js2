# #1085 — `bodyUsesArguments` recursion + compile-stack composition blows V8 stack under CI cgroup limits

## Problem

On 2026-04-11, push-to-main runs of `.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml`
on commit **ddcc5770** (PR #96 merge) regressed from 22,157 pass / 1,326 CE
(previous commit 4ce6f5d1) to 20,599 pass / 4,561 CE. The regression is
**deterministic under GitHub Actions** (two workflow_dispatch reruns on
commit debb90b7 produced bit-identical numbers) and **does not reproduce
locally** (dev-1053 ran 2697 tests through the same fork-worker harness
in the dev container and observed zero range_errors at the fc4b06c8
post-#96 pin).

The CE bucket is overwhelmingly `range_error` — ~3,200 new entries with
the error string "Maximum call stack size exceeded". 86.6% of them have
`compile_ms=0`, meaning the exception fires synchronously during
`inc.compile()` before any measurable codegen time accrues.

## Root cause

PR #96 (commit **a1ba0f23**, `fix(#1053): thread runtime argv extras via
module global for arguments`) added a new call site for `bodyUsesArguments`
inside `compileNestedFunctionDeclaration`:

```ts
// src/codegen/statements/nested-declarations.ts:200-207 (post-a1ba0f23)
if (stmt.body && bodyUsesArguments(stmt.body)) {
  ctx.funcUsesArguments.add(funcName);
}
```

`bodyUsesArguments` is itself a recursive AST walker:

```ts
export function bodyUsesArguments(node: ts.Node): boolean {
  // ... identifier check ...
  if (ts.isFunctionDeclaration(node) || ts.isFunctionExpression(node)) {
    return false;
  }
  return ts.forEachChild(node, bodyUsesArguments) ?? false;
}
```

`compileNestedFunctionDeclaration` is called recursively through the
codegen pipeline as nested function declarations are compiled. Under the
new call site, **every level of nested-function compilation invokes a
full-body recursive AST walk from inside the already-deep compile stack**.

Combined JS stack depth on a test with N nested function declarations and
an AST depth D per body becomes:

```
depth(compileStack) + depth(bodyUsesArguments) ≈ O(N) + O(D)  (additive, not max)
```

because the walker runs synchronously inside a compile frame that hasn't
yet returned.

Test262 contains pathological inputs (deeply nested closures, HOFs, arrow
chains) that push N×D into the hundreds. On a local dev container with a
generous V8 stack budget, this is fine. Under `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` —
which runs in a cgroup-constrained environment with a tighter V8 stack
limit — the composition trips `RangeError: Maximum call stack size
exceeded` and the exception blows past the js2wasm compile() entry point
entirely, rolling back to the test262 runner as a CE at `compile_ms=0`.

## Why the event-type wedge (push vs pull_request) fits

- **PR CI** for PR #96 itself ran on the branch BEFORE merge and reported
  the commit as healthy (~22,180 pass, 19 stack overflows — the existing
  baseline floor for deeply-nested tests). The pre-merge CI runs on the
  PR branch, which appears to be scheduled differently by GitHub Actions
  concurrency/cache semantics.
- **Push-to-main** CI (the gate that drives the baseline) runs on a
  different concurrency scope, with different resource distribution, and
  reliably hits the tighter stack limit.
- **Manual workflow_dispatch** reproduces the push-scope behavior exactly
  (deterministic 20,624 pass on repeat dispatch).

The three-way event-type discrimination is what made dev-1053's bisect
conclusive: same source, same workflow file, same fork-worker code — only
the event type differs. Resource distribution and cgroup stack budget are
the only plausible variables that change across event types.

## Fix

Convert both copies of `bodyUsesArguments` to an iterative DFS using an
explicit work stack. The walk's JS stack depth becomes O(1) regardless of
AST depth, so the composition with `compileNestedFunctionDeclaration` no
longer blows the V8 stack budget.

Semantics preserved exactly:
- Skip `FunctionDeclaration` / `FunctionExpression` subtrees (nested
  functions have their own `arguments` binding)
- Descend into arrow functions (they inherit enclosing `arguments`)
- The acdf90a8 binding-name guard (VariableDeclaration / Parameter /
  BindingElement `parent.name === node`) is retained verbatim

Both copies (`src/codegen/function-body.ts` and
`src/codegen/statements/nested-declarations.ts`) rewritten in lockstep
with byte-identical logic.

## Why not deduplicate or memoize in this patch

- **Deduplication** would import `bodyUsesArguments` from `function-body.ts`
  into `nested-declarations.ts`, but `function-body.ts` already imports
  `emitArgumentsVecBody` from `nested-declarations.ts`. The mutual import
  is the wrong kind of risk for an emergency patch shipping under CI
  pressure. Clean dedup = extract to `src/codegen/helpers/body-uses-arguments.ts`
  and retarget all 6 call sites — structural refactor, separate PR.
- **Memoization** via `WeakMap<ts.Node, boolean>` would collapse #96's
  hidden O(N²) re-walks to O(N), but that's a performance regression, not
  the crash. The iterative rewrite on its own stops the crash. The O(N²)
  → O(N) optimization lands as a follow-up in the same dedup PR.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Both copies of `bodyUsesArguments` converted to iterative DFS
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean
- [ ] `npm test -- tests/issue-1053.test.ts` → 9/9 pass
- [ ] Sample of 20 `test262/test/language/arguments-object/` tests
      preserves the +100 arguments-length wins from #1053
- [ ] PR #112 CI returns ≥ 22,100 pass (recovery to pre-#96 baseline)
- [ ] No new regressions vs. the pre-#96 baseline on the push-event
      sharded run

## Dependencies

- Follow-up PR (dedup + memoization) tracked as a separate issue once
  this emergency fix lands.
- #1080 (umbrella CI baseline-drift) — once this lands, main recovers
  and the umbrella's "structural CI fix" strand is unblocked.

## Risks

- **Semantics drift**: the iterative rewrite must match the recursive
  version's behavior exactly, including subtle edge cases like
  parameter-default-value scopes and the binding-name guard. Mitigation:
  byte-for-byte logic preservation and the #1053 test suite as regression
  guard.
- **Follow-up scope creep**: the dedup+memoization PR is tempting to fold
  in. Deliberately kept separate so each PR has a narrow review surface.

## Notes

- Audit trail:
  - Initial suspect list: #86, #91, #96, #100, #101, #103, #107, #1063
  - dev-1053 local chunk-1 rules out cross-test state corruption
  - dev-1053 cross-commit artifact bisect pins the flip at ddcc5770 (#96 merge)
  - dev-1031 hunk-level audit identifies the added call site inside
    `compileNestedFunctionDeclaration` and the stack-depth composition
    mechanism
  - Fix drafted in worktree `.claude/worktrees/issue-1053-stack-depth-fix`
    on 2026-04-11, typecheck + #1053 tests green locally
