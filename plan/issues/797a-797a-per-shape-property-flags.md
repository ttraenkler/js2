# #797a -- Per-shape property flags table (compile-time)

## Implementation summary

Built a compile-time per-shape property descriptor table: `Map<structTypeIdx, Map<fieldName, {writable, enumerable, configurable}>>`. Property attributes are resolved statically during struct registration. No runtime flags array needed -- the compiler knows all struct types and their fields at compile time. Default: all true, updated by Object.defineProperty/freeze/seal calls detected in source.
