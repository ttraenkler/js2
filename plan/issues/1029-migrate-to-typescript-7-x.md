# #1029 — Migrate to TypeScript 7.x (Go rewrite / `typescript-go`)

## GA re-audit (2026-08-13) — the external blocker is GONE

`typescript@7.0.2` is the `latest` dist-tag on npm; `@typescript/native-preview`
is frozen (last publish 2026-07-07) and superseded. The repo now installs GA
under the `typescript7` npm alias (`typescript7@npm:typescript@^7.0.2`) so it
coexists with the `typescript@^5.7` runtime dependency; `src/ts-api.ts` loads
the `typescript7/unstable/*` subpaths under `--ts7`. `blocked_by: external` is
removed — everything below in this issue's earlier sections describes the
preview era; these are the GA facts that matter:

- **A synchronous Checker API now EXISTS** (`typescript/unstable/sync`):
  `new API({cwd}); api.updateSnapshot({openProjects: [tsconfig]})` →
  `snapshot.getDefaultProjectForFile(f)` → `project.{program,checker}`.
  The Checker covers every method our #4218 audit measured as live:
  `getTypeAtLocation`, `getSymbolAtLocation`, `getTypeOfSymbol(AtLocation)`,
  `getResolvedSignature`, `getSignatureFromDeclaration`,
  `getReturnTypeOfSignature`, `getContextualType`, `getNonNullableType`,
  `getApparentType`, `getBaseConstraintOfType`, `getTypeArguments`,
  `getTypeFromTypeNode`, `isArrayType`/`isTupleType`, `isTypeAssignableTo`
  (only `getSymbolsInScope` — 1 call site — is absent). Many take batch
  (array) overloads for round-trip amortization. Measured: ~70ms cold
  API+project, ~0.12ms per sequential warm query over IPC. At the current
  ~264k-call volume that is ~30s/compile — per-node IPC is NOT viable until
  the #4218 kill order shrinks the query volume; at the post-kill ~1.6k
  residual it is ~0.2s.
- **`SyntaxKind` numeric values DIVERGED from TS5 at GA** (195/396 members
  renumbered; `EndOfFileToken`→`EndOfFile`, `ShebangTrivia` dropped,
  `Identifier` 80→79). The preview-era "identical enum values" finding in
  the audit below is NO LONGER TRUE. Symbolic access through the active
  backend's namespace (the `ts-api.ts` design) is fine; any numeric
  cross-backend comparison or persisted kind number is a latent bug.
- **AST shape otherwise holds up**: `node.forEachChild` instance method,
  `.parent` chains, node identity across repeated access, `statements`
  arrays, and the `ast/is` predicates all verified working against GA.
- **The root export is a bare version string** (`./lib/version.cjs`) — the
  Strada-style `import ts from "typescript"` namespace is gone for good.
- **`typescript/lib` no longer ships `lib.*.d.ts` files** (libs are embedded
  in the Go binary; platform binaries arrive via optionalDependencies).
  `src/checker/index.ts` reads TS5's lib files at runtime — that stays on
  typescript@5 until the #4218 extern-table work removes the need.
- The API subpaths are named `unstable/*` — upstream reserves the right to
  break them; pin exact versions when the compile pipeline starts using them.

**Immediate win landed with this re-audit — the repo's own typecheck.**
tsgo checks the same `src/` tree as `pnpm run typecheck` with ZERO
diagnostics in ~21s vs ~122s for TS5 (5.9×, 4-core container). It only
needed `types: ["node"]` (tsgo does not auto-include `@types/*`; without it,
~440 false `process`/`require` errors). `pnpm run typecheck:ts7` +
`tsconfig.ts7.json` are committed; the `quality` gate's `typecheck` script
is now pinned to the TS5 binary BY PATH — both packages ship a `tsc` bin
and `node_modules/.bin/tsc` is whichever pnpm linked last (it is tsgo
today), so bare `tsc` in any script is a silent-engine-swap hazard.
Flipping the CI gate to `typecheck:ts7` is a deliberate lead decision once
it has soaked.

## Scope decision (2026-08-14): TS7 in the Node lane ONLY

**TypeScript 7 replaces typescript@5 outside the browser and never for
runtime eval.** Two lanes stay pinned to TS5 *permanently* — this is a
settled boundary, not pending work:

| lane | backend | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node (CLI, CI, `compileFiles`/`compileProject`, test262) | TS7 (target) | can spawn the tsgo subprocess |
| browser (playground) | **TS5, pinned** | no process model; see the Wasm evaluation below |
| runtime-eval (`src/runtime-eval.ts`) | **TS5, pinned** | `__extern_eval` re-enters the pipeline **synchronously** (`compileSourceSync`) and must work in the browser — a subprocess round-trip cannot serve a sync in-process re-entry |

Enforced in code, not by convention: `src/ts-api.ts` exports
`ts7EligibleForLane()` (the pure policy), `currentTsFrontendLane()`, and
`runWithTs5Pinned()` — a *dynamic* scope, because the process can be
mid-eval while the outer compile legitimately used TS7. `runtime-eval.ts`
wraps all three of its `compileSourceSync` re-entries in it. Consumers must
gate on **`isTs7Active()`**, never on the raw `isTs7` flag. Pinned by
`tests/issue-1029-ts7-lane-policy.test.ts`.

### Why not compile tsgo to Wasm (evaluated and rejected, 2026-08-14)

The obvious escape from the subprocess constraint — and the repo already has
the build pattern (`scripts/quickjs-artifact/build.sh` compiles QuickJS to
Wasm with clang-18 + wasi-libc, keyed/verified/cached). Rejected on three
measured grounds:

- **It loses the speed it exists for.** tsgo's advantage is Go goroutine
  parallelism across files; both Go Wasm targets (`GOOS=js`, `wasip1`) are
  single-threaded.
- **Size goes the wrong way.** The tsgo native binary is **24 MB** vs
  typescript@5's **8.7 MB** of JS; Go→Wasm output runs comparable-to-larger
  than native. The browser would ship *more* bytes for a single-threaded
  frontend.
- **It wouldn't remove TypeScript from the playground anyway.** Monaco
  bundles its own TS language service (`ts.worker`, `typescriptDefaults`) for
  editor IntelliSense, and `website/playground/lib-loader.ts` globs
  `lib.*.d.ts` out of the typescript package (TS7 embeds lib texts in the Go
  binary rather than shipping files).

The deeper point: the blocker is the **API shape** (proto/LSP over IPC), not
the engine's compilation target. A Wasm build hands you the engine without
the binding — you would reimplement the transport in-memory against an
`unstable/*` protocol and track its churn, which is the same cost either way.

**Watch item that would flip this:** upstream shipping an official tsgo Wasm
build with a documented in-process API. Then it is a dependency swap, not a
project, and the quickjs-artifact script is the template.

### What still gates the Node-lane swap

Per the #4218 audit, a TS7 frontend is all-or-nothing per compile (a TS5
checker cannot answer queries about tsgo AST nodes), and the TS7 checker
costs ~0.12 ms/IPC query — ~1.8 s per compile at the current 15,121-query
residual. So the Node-lane swap runs *through* #4218's remaining sweep:
finish the in-house oracle, then TS7 parses with no checker in the loop.
Ordered blockers: oracle residual (15k calls, flat tail) → syntactic helpers
(~170 sites) → diagnostics (3 files) → `lib.*.d.ts` text (TS7 ships none) →
`createProgram` + module resolution (riskiest, keep last).

Migration order stays as #4218 concludes: make the checker droppable first
(inhouse oracle), then swap the parser to tsgo batch parse; the TS7 sync
Checker is a candidate for TS-mode differential validation, not for per-node
oracle traffic.

## Problem

Microsoft is rewriting the TypeScript compiler in Go as the 7.x successor to the current TypeScript 5.x/6.x JavaScript codebase (project codename "Corsa", repo at [microsoft/typescript-go](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go)). The Go compiler is announced as roughly 10× faster than the TypeScript-authored compiler and will eventually become the default `tsc`.

js2wasm currently uses the TypeScript 5.x/6.x JavaScript compiler as its parser and type-checker frontend. We invoke it from Node.js and walk the AST in `src/codegen/*`. A migration to TypeScript 7.x would:

- Potentially give a large compile-time speedup (parser + checker currently dominate cold compile time for larger inputs)
- Align us with the long-term supported TypeScript frontend
- Enable embedding the compiler as a Go/Wasm library from non-Node hosts (useful for `--target wasi` and the playground standalone mode)

## Status: Blocked on upstream API stability

The Go rewrite currently has **no stable public compiler API** for embedders. The upstream tracking discussion is:

- [microsoft/typescript-go#516 — "Transformer Plugin or Compiler API"](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/issues/516) (open)

Until typescript-go exposes a stable, embeddable compiler API (program / source file / type checker / symbol / node surface) that we can use from Node.js (via WASI or a `.node` addon) or from a Go host, we **cannot** replace our current TypeScript 5.x dependency without rewriting large parts of `src/codegen/*` against an unstable, moving target.

## Trigger to unblock

Reopen this issue and move it to `ready/` once one of the following lands upstream:

1. `microsoft/typescript-go#516` resolves with a documented, versioned compiler API
2. A separate RFC / release announcement from the typescript-go team declaring "the compiler API is stable"
3. A community-maintained Go/Node bridge emerges that provides an API surface compatible with the current `typescript` npm package's consumer-facing shape (`ts.createProgram`, `ts.TypeChecker`, `ts.Node` et al.)

## Scope when unblocked

- Benchmark the Go compiler's parse + check cost against current `typescript` 5.x/6.x for representative js2wasm inputs
- Evaluate whether we use typescript-go from Node via a subprocess/WASI bridge, or whether we introduce a Go-based build step
- Audit `src/codegen/*` for uses of the TypeScript API surface not yet provided by typescript-go
- Keep current TypeScript 5.x/6.x as a fallback path until feature parity is confirmed

## API Audit (2026-05-03, via #1288)

`@typescript/native-preview@7.0.0-dev.20260502.1` package exports:

| Export | What it is |
|--------|-----------|
| `./sync`, `./async` | `API`, `Project`, `Program`, `Checker`, `Snapshot` classes — require spawning a `tsgo` Go subprocess via socket/proto IPC |
| `./ast` | `SyntaxKind`, `NodeFlags`, `ScriptKind`, `ScriptTarget`, `isXxx` predicates — **in-process, no subprocess** |
| `./ast/factory` | AST factory helpers |
| `./dist/enums/` | All TypeScript enums standalone |

Key findings:
- **No `createProgram()` in-process.** All parse/check goes to the Go subprocess via IPC.
- **Enums are usable today** (`SyntaxKind`, `TypeFlags`, `ObjectFlags`, etc.) from `./ast` with zero subprocess overhead.
- **The Go binary is fast.** Local benchmark on ~70 .ts files: 22.9s (tsc) → 3.8s (tsgo) cold; 22s → 0.13s warm. The 10× headline holds.
- **AST nodes are the same shape.** The Go binary produces TypeScript AST nodes that are transmitted over IPC and presented as JS objects via `./sync`. Our codegen walks (`visitNode`, `SyntaxKind` switches) should be compatible.

### Batch approach (path forward for this issue)

The IPC overhead kills per-file subprocess calls. But `@typescript/native-preview/sync` exposes a `Project` class that can hold all source files — the Go binary processes them in parallel internally. For test262 (43k files), the approach would be:

1. Create one long-lived `Project` instance
2. Add all test262 input files via `project.updateSnapshot()`
3. Call `project.openFile()` once per file to get `Program` + AST
4. Walk the AST with existing codegen (same `SyntaxKind` switches)

This avoids 43k round-trips and lets the Go binary parallelize parse+check natively. The IPC payload would be one large proto blob vs 43k small ones.

Alternative: call the `tsgo` binary directly via its protocol (bypass the JS wrapper entirely). The JS wrapper is thin IPC glue; the protocol is documented in the `tsgo` source.

### Direct binary approach

`tsgo` exposes a long-lived server mode (same mechanism LSP uses). We could:
- Spawn one `tsgo` process
- Send batch file parse/check requests via the socket
- Receive AST + type info back as proto messages
- Deserialize in JS using the `./ast` types

This is deeper work but eliminates the JS wrapper overhead entirely. The Go binary handles all parallelism natively.

### Dependency on upstream

Neither approach requires waiting for `microsoft/typescript-go#516`. The subprocess API via `./sync` is already functional. The gap is on our side: threading the batch `Program` through the codegen pipeline (replacing `ts.createProgram()` call sites).

## Concrete benchmark (2026-05-03 — directly validated in /workspace worktree)

Tested against the full `src/**/*.ts` tree (~70 files, ~12k LOC):

| Metric | TS5 | TS7 batch | Ratio |
|--------|-----|-----------|-------|
| Cold project parse | 22,900ms | 173ms | **132× faster** |
| `getSourceFile()` cold (first fetch) | 0ms (in-memory) | 2ms/file (IPC fetch) | — |
| `getSourceFile()` warm (JS cache) | 0ms | 0.001ms | — |
| Total 3-file round-trip after snapshot | 6ms | 6ms | ~equal |

**Critical compatibility findings:**

1. `allowJs: true` works in tsgo — plain JavaScript files parse and return valid AST.
2. **AST nodes are 100% property-compatible**:
   - `ImportDeclaration.moduleSpecifier.text` ✅
   - `FunctionDeclaration.name.text`, `.body.statements.length` ✅
   - `VariableDeclaration.name.text`, `.initializer.kind` ✅
   - `SyntaxKind` enum values are **identical** between TS5 and TS7
   - `node.pos`, `node.end`, `node.flags` ✅
   - `node.parent` chain works ✅
3. **One change required**: `ts.forEachChild(node, cb)` → `node.forEachChild(cb)` (the TS7 `forEachChild` is a method on each node, not a static function). This is a mechanical search-replace across `src/codegen/*.ts`.
4. **TypeChecker gap**: `proj.program.getTypeChecker()` doesn't exist in TS7. The program exposes `getSemanticDiagnostics`, `getSyntacticDiagnostics`, etc., but not a walkable `TypeChecker`. For test262 (plain JS, no TS type annotations), TypeChecker provides minimal value anyway — type inference from type annotations is absent. TS5 can be kept as a TypeChecker fallback for TS-mode compilation.
5. **`node.forEachChild` walks 37,026 nodes** in `index.ts` correctly — the full AST is traversable.

## Implementation plan (now feasible without upstream stabilization)

**Phase 1 — test262 runner** (high value, self-contained):
1. In `tests/test262-runner.ts`, replace the per-file `ts.createProgram([file], opts)` pattern with:
   - One `new API({})` + `api.updateSnapshot({ openProject: tsconfig })` per worker shard
   - Per-file `proj.program.getSourceFile(path)` (cached after first fetch)
2. In `src/codegen/*.ts`, replace `ts.forEachChild(node, visitor)` → `node.forEachChild(visitor)` (search-replace; TS7 nodes have this method)
3. TypeChecker: in the test262 path (JS files), skip TypeChecker usage (already mostly a no-op for unannotated JS). For TS-mode compilation, keep TS5 checker.
4. Expected test262 throughput improvement: Go binary handles all shard files in parallel; cold-parse per shard drops from O(n×tsc_startup) to one fast `updateSnapshot`.

**Phase 2 — full TS-mode compilation** (requires TypeChecker workaround):
- Option A: Keep TS5 `TypeChecker` alongside TS7 AST (hybrid mode — parse fast, type-check with TS5)
- Option B: Use TS7 semantic diagnostics to extract type info (needs investigation)
- Option C: Wait for upstream `TypeChecker` API exposure

**Tracked separately**: implementation issue will be filed as #1290 (test262 runner TS7 batch).

## Notes

The original blocker ("no stable public compiler API") is resolved in practice — `@typescript/native-preview/sync` is already functional and AST-compatible. The remaining work is on our side. This issue can now be moved to `ready` once #1288 merges and team capacity allows.

The TypeChecker gap is the only genuine limitation vs. TS5. For test262 (plain JS), it's irrelevant. For full TS compilation, Phase 2 options above apply.
