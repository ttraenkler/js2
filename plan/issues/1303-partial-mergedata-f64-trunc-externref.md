# #1303 — Wasm validation: `f64.trunc` operand is `externref`, not `f64`

## Background

Surfaced in #1292 (lodash Tier 2 stress test) compiling
`node_modules/lodash-es/partial.js`:

```
WebAssembly.Module(): Compiling function #94:"mergeData" failed:
f64.trunc[0] expected type f64, found global.get of type externref @+36700
```

`mergeData` (a lodash internal called from partial's HOF) emits an
`f64.trunc` whose argument is a `global.get` of an externref-typed
global. The codegen is missing an `extern.convert_any` + unbox to f64
before the trunc.

## Hypothesis

The arithmetic-on-externref code path likely:

1. Reads a captured numeric variable that was promoted to externref
   storage (because it crossed a closure boundary or got widened to
   union type)
2. Performs an integer truncation (`Math.floor` / `| 0` / spread-arg
   length probably) that the compiler maps to `f64.trunc`
3. Forgets to emit the externref→f64 unbox between the load and the
   trunc

`type-coercion.ts` has the `coerceType` helper for these conversions
(externref → f64 via `__unbox_number` import). It's not being invoked
on this code path.

## Reproduction

```bash
npx tsx -e "
import { compileProject } from './src/index.ts';
const r = compileProject('node_modules/lodash-es/partial.js', {allowJs:true});
console.log('compile success:', r.success);
new WebAssembly.Module(r.binary); // throws
"
```

## Fix scope

- Identify the codegen path for `mergeData`'s `f64.trunc` emission
- Insert `coerceType(target=f64)` before the trunc when the operand is
  externref
- Verify the same gap doesn't exist for sibling integer truncation ops
  (`f64.nearest`, `f64.floor`, `f64.ceil`, `i32.trunc_sat_*`)

## Files

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — `f64.trunc` emission site
- `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` — `coerceType` helper

## Acceptance criteria

1. `compileProject('node_modules/lodash-es/partial.js')` produces a
   binary that passes `new WebAssembly.Module(...)` validation
2. Sibling truncation ops (`Math.floor`, `Math.ceil`, etc.) on externref
   operands also coerce correctly — add a focused unit test
3. No regression in #1180 (env-unbox-number rules) or Tier 1/2 stress
4. `tests/stress/lodash-tier2.test.ts` Tier 2c case can flip from
   `it.skip` to `it`

## Resolution (2026-05-07)

Root cause was NOT a missing externref→f64 unbox in the legacy bitwise
codegen — the `compileBitwiseBinaryOp` site emitted f64.trunc against
operands that were f64 globals at compile time. The bug was an
over-shift in `fixupModuleGlobalIndices` (`src/codegen/registry/imports.ts`):
the per-call `shifted: Set<Instr[]>` only tracked top-level entries,
not nested bodies reached via recursion through `if/then/else`,
`block.body`, `try/catches`. When `compileLogicalAnd` /
`compileLogicalOr` restored `fctx.body = saved` directly instead of
calling `popBody`, every late string-constant import added afterwards
re-shifted the same nested body once via `currentFunc.body` recursion
AND once for each leaked `savedBodies` entry. The over-shift drove the
`global.get` past the f64 globals into the externref tail of the global
table — so the compile-time-f64 operand became an externref operand at
link time, tripping `f64.trunc`.

Fix: move the `shifted.has` guard INSIDE the recursive
`shiftGlobalIndices`, mirroring the pattern already used for function
indices in `addUnionImports`. Now every Instr[] is shifted at most once
per fixup call regardless of how many distinct entry-point references
point to it.

Test coverage: `tests/issue-1303.test.ts` (10 tests) +
`tests/stress/lodash-tier2.test.ts` Tier 2c flipped from `it.skip` to
`runIfInstalled`.
