# #607 — Remaining small skip patterns (302 tests)

## Status: open

Small skip patterns not covered by other issues. Each blocks 5-63 tests:

### Easy (filter removal, feature exists)

| Filter | Tests | Fix |
|--------|------:|-----|
| return undefined into arithmetic | 45 | Stale — null/undefined coercion works |
| for-of object destructuring from array | 35 | Should work now |
| IIFE patterns | 14+25=39 | Should compile |
| string variable concatenation | 11 | Should work |
| typeof on member expression | 10 | Should work |
| array-like object with .length | 10 | May work |
| this.property at global scope | 6 | Needs module-level this |
| closure-as-value passed to assert | 6 | Should work |
| arithmetic on objects | 5 | valueOf coercion exists |

### Medium (feature partially missing)

| Filter | Tests | Fix |
|--------|------:|-----|
| rest-destructuring with numeric-key object pattern | 46 | Needs numeric key → array mapping |
| unicode escape line terminator edge case | 63 | Parser edge case |
| for-of generator hang risk | 106 | Need per-test hang detection, not blanket skip |
| throw/try hang risk | 33 | Same — needs per-test detection |

### Low priority (proposals / niche)

| Filter | Tests | Fix |
|--------|------:|-----|
| source-phase-imports | 90 | Stage 3 proposal |
| import-defer | 62 | Stage 3 proposal |
| tail-call-optimization | 33 | #602 |

## Complexity: S-M (varies)
