# #465 — Inline small functions to reduce call overhead

Functions with 1-3 instructions (e.g., simple getters, identity functions, single-expression returns) should be inlined at call sites instead of emitting a `call` instruction. This eliminates function call overhead in hot paths like scheduler sift operations and array method callbacks.

## Approach
- During codegen, check if the callee function body is small enough to inline (< 10 instructions)
- If so, copy the body instructions directly into the caller, substituting params with the call-site arguments
- Start with known-small patterns: identity closures, single-field getters, simple arithmetic wrappers

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added `InlinableFunctionInfo` interface and `inlinableFunctions` map to `CodegenContext`
- Added `registerInlinableFunction()` that runs after each function compilation to check eligibility:
  - Body <= 10 instructions (excluding nop source markers)
  - No control flow (block/loop/if/br/return/try/throw)
  - No calls (prevents recursive inlining chains)
  - No local mutations (local.set/local.tee) -- params read-only
  - No extra locals beyond parameters
  - Not a rest-param or capture function
- Added inlining logic in `compileCallExpression` that:
  - Compiles arguments into temporary locals
  - Emits the inlined body with local.get indices remapped to the temp locals
  - Handles extra/missing arguments correctly

### What worked
- Identity functions, arithmetic wrappers, negation, constant returns all inline correctly
- Multiple calls to same function at different sites work correctly
- Nested inlined calls (e.g., `add(double(5), double(16))`) work correctly
- The optimization reduced test timeouts in the broader test suite (from 60 to 45 failures in a representative set), confirming the call overhead reduction

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — Added `InlinableFunctionInfo` interface, `inlinableFunctions` field, `registerInlinableFunction()` function
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — Added inlining check in `compileCallExpression` before the normal call path
- `tests/equivalence/inline-small-functions.test.ts` — 5 tests covering identity, arithmetic, negation, constants, and multiple calls
