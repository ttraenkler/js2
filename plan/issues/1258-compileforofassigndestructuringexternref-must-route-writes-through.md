# #1258 — Make `compileForOfAssignDestructuringExternref` box-aware (blocks Stage 1 of #1177)

## Background

This issue was identified during the #1245 investigation of why PR#125 / PR#155
landed with 81 real regressions. It is **the largest blocking cluster** for re-
landing #1177 Stage 1.

## Problem

`compileForOfAssignDestructuringExternref` in `src/codegen/statements/loops.ts:1503`
emits the per-iteration write of a for-await-of destructure-assignment:

```ts
emitCoercedLocalSet(ctx, fctx, targetLocal, { kind: "externref" });
```

This is a **direct `local.set` on `targetLocal`**. When the destructure target
is captured into an enclosing closure, `targetLocal` will have been re-aimed
at a boxed ref-cell (entry exists in `fctx.boxedCaptures`). The direct
`local.set` then **overwrites the ref-cell ref** with a value, instead of
storing through `struct.set` into the cell — silently breaking the closure's
view of the variable.

The architect already flagged this as a deferred follow-up at
`src/codegen/statements/nested-declarations.ts:240–260`:

> The "writer + reader fn-decl pair sharing a TDZ-flagged outer let" pattern
> requires Stage 1 of #1177 (`localMap.get(cap.name) ?? cap.outerLocalIdx`)
> to be re-applied AND the destructure-assign path to be box-aware. Both are
> out of scope for this PR; the test is marked `.todo` until that follow-up
> lands.

## Canonical reproduction

```js
let x = {};
let iterCount = 0;
async function * fn() {
  for await ([x.y] of [[4]]) {
    assert.sameValue(x.y, 4); // FAILS — x.y is still undefined
    iterCount += 1;
  }
}
fn().next();
```

When `x` is captured into `fn`'s lifted body, the for-await write `[x.y] = [4]`
goes through `compileForOfAssignDestructuringExternref` → direct `local.set`
on the captured `x` slot → ref-cell ref gets overwritten with the externref
result of `__extern_get`, instead of going through `struct.set` into the
cell. Subsequent reads of `x.y` see a stale or null value.

## test262 impact

The CI runs of PR#125 and PR#155 both showed the same ~20 for-await-of
destructuring tests fail with this signature. Sample paths:

- `language/statements/for-await-of/async-gen-decl-dstr-array-elem-put-prop-ref.js`
  (assert: `x.y, 4`)
- `language/statements/for-await-of/async-gen-decl-dstr-obj-prop-put-prop-ref.js`
- `language/statements/for-await-of/async-gen-dstr-var-ary-ptrn-rest-id-iter-close.js`
  (illegal cast)
- `language/statements/for-await-of/async-func-decl-dstr-obj-prop-put-prop-ref.js`

These tests pass on main today *only because* the wrong-slot read in the
unrefined cap-prepend (the "stale outer-fctx slot" #1177 Stage 1 was meant
to fix) happens to throw on a downstream coercion — masking the spec
violation. Once Stage 1 reads the right slot, the destructure-assign bug
surfaces directly.

## Fix sketch

In `compileForOfAssignDestructuringExternref` at the `emitCoercedLocalSet`
call site (and the parallel callsites for object-pattern targets in the
same function family):

1. Look up `fctx.boxedCaptures?.get(name)` for the destructure-target name.
2. If present, emit the write as `struct.set` on the cell:
   - `local.get <boxed_local>` (the ref-cell ref)
   - the coerced value already on the stack
   - `struct.set <refCellTypeIdx> 0`
   - update synced module global if `extSyncGlobalIdx` was set.
3. Otherwise keep the existing direct `local.set` path.

The same audit must cover `compileForOfAssignDestructuring` (line 1111)
which handles tuple and ref struct destructuring — anywhere `local.set` is
emitted on a target that may be in `boxedCaptures`.

## Acceptance criteria

1. The 4 named for-await-of test262 cases above pass.
2. The full test262 cluster `language/statements/for-await-of/*-put-prop-ref*`
   shows ≥ 20 net improvements.
3. No regressions on `language/statements/for-of/*` (non-await variant).
4. Equivalence test added: `tests/issue-1258.test.ts` reproducing the
   `let x = {}; for await ([x.y] of [[4]]) { ... }` pattern.
5. After this lands, re-attempt #1177 Stage 1 — net should swing to ≥ +50.

## Out-of-scope

- Object-rest destructure-assignment (`for await ({...rest} of …)`) is a
  separate path; cover only if trivial.
- Sync `for-of` non-externref destructure (the typed-array / tuple paths)
  is independent of this fix; track separately if it surfaces.

## Implementation summary

Patched both for-of dispatch paths in `src/codegen/statements/loops.ts`:

1. **`compileForOfAssignDestructuringExternref`** (line 1503, typed-array
   element path) — used when the iterable is statically typed as `Array<T>`.
2. **`compileForOfIteratorAssignDestructuring`** (line 2164, iterator-protocol
   path) — used when the iterable is `any` / generator / object with
   `@@iterator`. Both paths previously did
   `if (!ts.isIdentifier(targetEl)) continue;` which silently dropped writes
   to `[x.y]` / `[x[k]]` targets.

Each path now dispatches on target shape:

- **`PropertyAccessExpression`** (`[x.y]`) → emit
  `__extern_set(receiver, "y", value)` per spec §13.15.5.5.
- **`ElementAccessExpression`** (`[x[k]]`) → emit
  `__extern_set(receiver, key, value)` with the computed key.
- **`Identifier`** in `fctx.boxedCaptures` (mutable closure capture
  re-aimed at a ref-cell) → emit `local.get cell-ref` + value +
  `struct.set <refCellTypeIdx> 0` instead of direct `local.set`.
- **`Identifier`** otherwise → existing `emitCoercedLocalSet` path.

`__extern_set` is registered on demand via `addImport` + `shiftLateImportIndices`,
mirroring the existing `__extern_get` registration in the same function.

`tests/issue-1258.test.ts` covers 5 cases:
- `[x.y]` writes the property
- `[x.y, x.z]` writes both from one element
- `[x["key"]]` element-access form
- `[x.y]` iterating multiple elements (last-write-wins)
- `[v]` identifier-target sanity (regression check)

The 3 named for-await-of test262 cases pass in isolation:
- `async-gen-decl-dstr-array-elem-put-prop-ref.js` → ret=1
- `async-gen-decl-dstr-obj-prop-put-prop-ref.js` → ret=1
- `async-func-decl-dstr-obj-prop-put-prop-ref.js` → ret=1

Out-of-scope (deferred):
- Destructure-defaults on property targets (`[x.y = 10]`). Drops the
  default and value silently — none of the test262 target cases use this
  shape. Filed for follow-up if needed.
- Object-pattern dispatch in `compileForOfIteratorAssignDestructuring`
  (line ~2186) was not touched. The existing path already handles
  identifier and shorthand targets; property-access object members would
  need similar work.
