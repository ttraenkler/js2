# #604 — Narrow async flag skip filter (1,311 tests)

## Status: open

1,311 tests skipped because they have the `async` flag in metadata. The compiler now supports async/await (#30). Many of these should compile — the filter is a blanket skip from before async was implemented.

## Approach

1. Remove the `async` flag skip entirely
2. Tests that use simple async/await will pass
3. Tests with complex Promise chains, .then(), or async iteration may fail — file those as separate issues
4. Keep `unsupported feature: async-iteration` (94 tests) as a separate narrower filter if needed

## Complexity: S
