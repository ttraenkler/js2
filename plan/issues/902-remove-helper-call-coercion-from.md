# #902 -- Remove helper-call coercion from pure numeric recursive call/return paths

## Problem

The `fib` regression is materially driven by helper-call coercion inserted around recursive call results and returns.

Current regressed shape:

- base-case return goes through `call 22`
- recursive call results go through `call 21`
- final return goes through `call 22`
- nearby numeric lowering may also introduce avoidable representation churn where a direct `f64` path should suffice

Older fast shape:

- direct recursive `call`
- direct `f64.add`
- direct `return`

The benchmark evidence is already documented in parent issue [#897](/Users/thomas/Documents/Arbeit/Startup/Projekte/Mosaic/code/@loopdive/ts2wasm/plan/issues/sprints/34/897.md). This subissue isolates the likely primary cause.

## Requirements

1. Identify which coercion path inserts helper calls around numeric call results and returns
2. Identify whether unnecessary numeric representation conversions are also being inserted around the recursive path
3. Prove when a recursive `number -> number` function can stay entirely on the direct numeric Wasm path
4. Emit direct call/result/return code in those cases
5. Preserve helper/coercion fallbacks for mixed-type, generic, externref, or nullable call paths
6. Add regression coverage that structurally asserts the direct recursive shape

## Smoke Test Results (2026-04-03)

**Issue is already fixed on current main.** See #897 smoke test — the compiled fib WAT has direct recursive calls, direct f64.add, direct return, no helper-call coercion.

## Acceptance criteria

- pure numeric recursion no longer emits helper calls around recursive results or returns
- no unnecessary numeric representation churn remains in the proven pure-recursive case
- `fib` WAT again shows:
  - direct recursive `call`
  - direct `f64.add`
  - direct `return`
- correctness for dynamic/non-numeric call paths is preserved
