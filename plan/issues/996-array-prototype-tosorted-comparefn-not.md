# #996 -- Array.prototype.toSorted comparefn-not-a-function hits 30s compiler timeout

## Problem

The last full recheck (`benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260407-005506.jsonl`)
contains a **30s compile timeout** for:

- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/toSorted/comparefn-not-a-function.js`

This is another singleton timeout that likely belongs to array callback or
sorting helper lowering, not the other timeout clusters.

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§23.1.3.34 Array.prototype.toSorted](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.tosorted) — step 2: if comparefn is not undefined and not callable, throw TypeError


## Suggested fix

1. Reproduce this file in isolation
2. Compare with passing `toSorted` tests and existing array callback issues
3. Fix the slow path so the test fails or passes quickly instead of timing out

## Acceptance criteria

- the test compiles in <5s locally
- no `compile_timeout` remains for this test in a full recheck

## Status — DEFERRED (pre-box approach regressed too many tests)

**Root cause confirmed:**
The 30-second compile_timeout is a runtime hang in
`for (var i = 0; i < N; i++) { fn(function() { ... i ... }); }`.
The closure correctly captures outer `i` as mutable; boxing is emitted
lazily AT the closure-creation site (mid-loop body). The for-loop
condition's `local.get i` was emitted earlier and reads the unboxed
local — never seeing `i++`'s ref-cell update.

**Attempted fix (rolled back):**
A `preBoxClosureCaptures` pre-pass that boxed every captured-as-mutable
variable at function entry was implemented and tested locally. It fixed
this test (compile 525 ms; runs to completion, returns 2 = assertion
fail because `toSorted` doesn't yet throw TypeError on a non-callable
comparefn). But CI showed ~329 test262 regressions: 215 assertion_fail
(mostly `test/language/expressions/object/dstr/...` generator-method
tests where `callCount` goes through a ref cell that some callsites
don't see), 25 illegal_cast, 62 new compile_timeouts, and ~25 more
across other buckets. The pre-box pass interacts badly with:
- generator method bodies (call dispatch path doesn't honour
  `boxedCaptures` on every read site)
- object-literal accessor / destructuring-default closures
- IIFE-style `new function(){...}(args)` constructor invocations
  (worked locally after a separate alreadyBoxed fix in
  `compileNewFunctionExpression`, but other paths still regress)

**What stayed:**
The scope-aware closure analysis (introduced for #995) is independent
and lands in this PR. It correctly handles inner `var i;` shadowing
in nested functions.

**Follow-up needed:**
A more targeted approach to fix this loop+closure pattern without
boxing every capture. Candidates:
1. Detect the specific pattern (loop initializer `var x = 0` +
   closure-in-body that reads x after `i++`) and box only that
   variable, only inside the loop scope.
2. Switch to per-iteration capture snapshots (let-style) for `for`
   loops — but `var` semantics technically require shared binding,
   so this can't be a default.
3. Fix the lazy-boxing path to retroactively rewrite any earlier
   `local.get x` to `local.get refCell ; struct.get` when boxing
   happens mid-function. Requires tracking emitted reads.

Acceptance criteria for #996 remain open until one of the above
lands. The current PR closes #995 and is regression-free.
