# #955 — Eliminate redundant ref.test + ref.cast pairs

## Source

Discovered by `scripts/analyze-wat-patterns.ts` (#948) — corpus of 3,619 modules.

## Problem

36% of modules (1,291/3,619) contain 8,642 `ref.test (ref N)` + `ref.cast (ref N)` pairs for the same type index. Every struct field access (property read) generates this pattern:

```wat
local.get 1
ref.test (ref 1)        ;; check if it's a Point
(if
  (then
    local.get 1
    ref.cast (ref 1)    ;; cast to Point — redundant if test just passed!
    struct.get 1 0
    ...
  )
  (else
    i64.const 9218868440963334366
    f64.reinterpret_i64  ;; NaN for "not a struct" path
  )
)
```

Inside the `(then` branch, we KNOW `ref.test` returned true, so `ref.cast` to the same type is guaranteed to succeed and wastes an instruction.

## Fix

### Option A: Peephole (easiest)
In `src/codegen/peephole.ts`, add a rule:
```
ref.test (ref N)
if (then
  ref.cast (ref N)  ← remove this if same N and no intervening ops that could change the ref
)
```

### Option B: Codegen (most correct)
In `src/codegen/expressions.ts`, when generating the struct-access pattern:
- In the `(then` branch (after `ref.test` succeeded), emit `ref.cast_nonnull` or use the already-cast value
- Track that inside an `if (then)` that follows `ref.test (ref N)`, the ref is already known to be of type N

### Option A is simpler and can be done in a single peephole pass.

## Impact

8,642 redundant instructions × ~1 byte each = ~8.4KB of unnecessary binary size across the corpus.
Real-world impact: every property access on a class instance has at least one pair.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `scripts/analyze-wat-patterns.ts` reports `ref_test_cast_pairs.count` reduced significantly
- All existing tests continue to pass
- WAT shows `ref.cast` only in non-branch positions (not immediately after `ref.test` of same type)

## Test Plan

```typescript
class Point { x: number; y: number; constructor(x: number, y: number) { this.x = x; this.y = y; } }
export function test(): number { const p = new Point(1, 2); return p.x + p.y; }
```

Before fix: WAT shows `ref.test (ref 1)` + `ref.cast (ref 1)` pair.
After fix: WAT shows only `ref.cast (ref 1)` (or `ref.cast_nonnull`) without preceding `ref.test`.

## Suspended Work

- **Worktree**: /workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-955
- **Branch**: issue-955-ref-test-cast-peephole
- **Done**: Implementation complete (peephole Pattern 5 in `src/codegen/peephole.ts`, fast path in `src/codegen/property-access.ts`). 5/5 issue tests pass. Branch merged with main at commit `abd475a6`. Signaled to tech lead for merge.
- **Remaining**: Awaiting tech lead merge confirmation only.
- **Resume**: Branch is ready. Just re-signal tech lead: "Branch `issue-955-ref-test-cast-peephole`, commit `abd475a6`, worktree `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-955` ready for merge."
