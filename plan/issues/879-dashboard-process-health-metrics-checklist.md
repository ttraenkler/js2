# #879 -- Dashboard: process health metrics

## Problem

Dashboard tracks test262 progress but not process health — are agents following checklists? Are merges clean? How many dangerous operations did hooks block?

## Requirements

- **Checklist compliance**: count commits with CHECKLIST-FOXTROT vs total commits (from git log)
- **Merge protocol**: count ff-only merges vs merge commits (from git log)
- **Hook blocks**: parse hook logs if available, or count revert commits as proxy for bad merges
- **Rebase churn**: count branch `-v2`/`-v3` variants as proxy for rebase retries

## Acceptance criteria

- Process health section in dashboard with 3-4 metric cards
- Data derived from git history, no manual tracking needed
