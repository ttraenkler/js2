## Implementation summary (2026-05-01)

The bounds-check-elimination scaffolding from #464 was already in place but had
two soundness gaps that prevented it being widely applicable:

1. The pattern matcher accepted `<=` and `>=` as well as `<` / `>`. With
   `i <= arr.length`, the last iteration sees `i == arr.length` — out of
   bounds — so the elided `array.get` would trap.
2. There was no analysis of the loop body. A body that re-assigned `i` or
   `arr`, or called a mutating method on `arr` (push/pop/splice/etc.), or
   declared a nested function that could capture either binding, would also
   make the optimisation unsound.

This change tightens both:

- `src/codegen/statements/loops.ts::compileForStatement` now only marks the
  pair safe for the strict relational operators.
- `loopBodyMutatesIndexOrArray` performs a conservative AST walk to detect
  any mutation of the index/array bindings, any method call on `arr`, any
  `arr.length = …` assignment, and any nested function/class. If any of
  these are found, BCE is skipped.
- `src/codegen/expressions/assignment.ts::compileElementAssignment` extends
  BCE to the vec-struct write path: when `isSafeBoundsEliminated` fires on
  the target, we skip the entire grow check + length-update and emit a
  direct `array.set`. This is the array-sum fill-loop case.

Tests: see `tests/equivalence/issue-1196.test.ts` — 12 cases covering the
canonical pattern (read, write, read+write), the `<=` soundness fix,
body-mutation fall-back (i mutated, arr re-assigned, arr.pop()), nested
loops, and closure-capture fall-back.

# #1196 — Bounds-check elimination via SSA on monotonic indexed loops

## Problem

WasmGC `array.get` / `array.set` include a runtime bounds check. In a tight loop of the shape:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  arr[i] = expr;        // bounds check on store
  // or
  sum += arr[i];        // bounds check on load
}
```

every iteration runs `if (i >= arr.length) trap` even though the loop's own condition has already proven `i < arr.length`. On the `array-sum` benchmark with `runtimeArg=1000000`, that's **2 million redundant checks** (1M for the fill loop, 1M for the reduce loop). At ~1–2 cycles each, that's ~2–4M cycles of pure waste in a hot loop.

V8's TurboFan eliminates these via SSA: `i ∈ [0, n)` proves `i < arr.length` as long as `n ≤ arr.length` is known. Wasm doesn't have an SSA pass at the validator level, but we can do this at codegen time.

## Implementation plan

### Approach 1 — pattern-match the canonical loop shape (preferred for v1)

Detect the AST pattern:

```ts
ts.ForStatement {
  initializer: let i = 0  (or const i for unused-write loops)
  condition:   i < arr.length  (or i < n where n ≤ arr.length is known)
  incrementor: i++ or ++i or i += 1
  body: ... arr[i] ...
}
```

When this pattern matches AND the body does not modify `i`, `arr`, or any value affecting the condition, emit array accesses with the bounds check skipped. The Wasm spec doesn't have a `array.get_unchecked` op, so the implementation must:

**Option A (host-import escape hatch):** Add a `__array_get_unchecked` helper that uses `extern.convert_any` + raw memory access. Loses type safety, only works in JS host mode. Reject — violates the dual-mode principle.

**Option B (lift bounds check above the loop):** Emit a single explicit `if (n > arr.length) trap` BEFORE the loop, then use the regular `array.get`. The wasm-opt optimizer (`-O`) recognises that the bounds check inside the loop is dominated by the explicit pre-loop check and eliminates it. This is the standard trick — used by AssemblyScript and others.

Recommend **Option B** for v1: zero new opcodes, leverages existing `wasm-opt -O3` infrastructure, fully type-safe, works in standalone mode.

Concrete codegen change:
- In `src/codegen/statements/loops.ts::compileForStatement`, when the canonical shape is detected, emit a pre-loop guard:
  ```
  local.get $arr
  array.len
  local.get $loopBound  ;; (arr.length, or n in `i < n`)
  i32.gt_u
  br_if 0  ;; (or i32.const 1; trap)
  ```
- Then emit the loop body unchanged. wasm-opt's analysis then eliminates the per-iteration check.

If `wasm-opt` is not run (standalone mode without `--optimize`), the per-iteration check remains. Document this — Option B's benefit is gated on the optimizer pass. For v2 we can teach the peephole pass to do the elimination directly.

### Approach 2 — SSA-on-IR pass (Phase 2, deferred)

Once the IR (#1183 series) covers more language features, add a proper SSA-based range analysis pass. For each value, track an interval. When emitting an `array.get`, if the index's interval is provably `[0, len)`, skip the check.

This subsumes Approach 1 and handles non-canonical loop shapes. Higher cost — defer until the IR is mature.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `array-sum` competitive benchmark `runtimeArg=1000000` hot runtime improves by **at least 1.5×** when run with `--optimize` (`wasm-opt -O3`). Without `--optimize` the improvement may be smaller — document the optimizer dependency.
2. New equivalence test in `tests/issue-1190.test.ts` covering:
   - Canonical shape: `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) ...` — must produce same output as before
   - Out-of-range access: `for (let i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++)` — must STILL trap (don't remove the check unsoundly)
   - Index modified inside body — fall back to per-iteration check
   - Array reassigned inside body — fall back to per-iteration check
3. CI test262 net delta ≥ 0; no array-related regressions.

## Out of scope

- SSA-based range analysis (Approach 2 — deferred).
- Bounds-check elimination on object property access (`obj.x`) — different mechanism.
- TypedArray-specific optimizations (separate path through `src/runtime.ts`).

## Risk

Soundness: never skip a bounds check that the loop didn't actually prove. Test out-of-range cases explicitly. The pre-loop guard approach is sound by construction (same trap, just earlier) but the pattern-match must be tight — if the body reassigns `arr` to a shorter array, the pre-loop guard becomes invalid. Bail to per-iteration check if any of the inputs are non-final.

## Notes

This is the `bounds-check elimination` Tier 1 win called out in the array-sum perf analysis after the 2026-04-27 bench refresh. Composes multiplicatively with #1195 (escape-analysis scalarization) and #1197 (i32 element specialization).
