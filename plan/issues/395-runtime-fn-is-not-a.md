# #395 -- Runtime "fn is not a function" errors (70 FAIL)

## Status: in-progress

70 tests compile but fail at runtime with "fn is not a function" errors. The callable value is not resolved correctly, likely due to closure or function-reference coercion issues.

## Details

These tests compile without errors but at runtime the Wasm module attempts to call a value that is not a valid function reference. Common causes:

- Closures stored in variables that lose their function reference type
- Function references passed as externref that are not properly unboxed before calling
- Method references extracted from objects that become null refs
- Higher-order functions receiving incorrect function table indices

```javascript
var fn = obj.method;
fn();  // "fn is not a function" if fn was coerced to externref
```

Fix:
1. Audit function reference coercion paths in compileCallExpression
2. Ensure closures maintain their funcref type through variable assignment
3. Fix externref-to-funcref unboxing for stored function references

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Functions stored in variables can be called correctly
- [x] Method references extracted from objects remain callable
- [ ] Reduce "fn is not a function" runtime failures by ~70

## Implementation Notes

### Root Cause
Three distinct problems caused function references to lose their callable nature:

1. **`compileIdentifier` didn't handle function names as values**: When `var fn = foo` was compiled, `foo` was not found in locals/globals, so it fell through to the "unknown identifier" fallback which emitted `ref.null.extern`. The function was never actually referenced.

2. **Variable declarations coerced closure refs to externref**: `resolveWasmType` returns `externref` for function types, so variables like `var fn = makeAdder(10)` would get typed as `externref`. The `compileExpression` call would then coerce the actual closure struct ref to externref via `extern.convert_any`, losing the callable struct ref.

3. **Reassignment didn't preserve closure types**: When `fn = bar` was compiled after `fn = foo`, the assignment handler didn't recognize that the local already held a closure ref type and would apply externref coercion.

### Solution
Three-part fix:

1. **Function ref wrapping** (`emitFuncRefAsClosure`): When a function name from `funcMap` is used as a value expression (not in a call), create a closure struct wrapping it. A per-function trampoline is generated that delegates `(self, ...params) -> call $original`. Struct types are shared across functions with the same signature via `funcRefWrapperCache`.

2. **Variable declaration fix**: In `compileVariableStatement`, detect callable variable types and compile the initializer without an externref type hint. If the result is still externref (e.g., from a function that returns a coerced closure), match the TS call signature against registered `closureInfoByTypeIdx` entries and emit `any.convert_extern` + `ref.cast` to recover the closure struct ref.

3. **Assignment fix**: In `compileAssignment`, extend the existing function-expression handling to also recognize function name identifiers (`isFuncRefRHS`) and locals that already have a closure ref type (`localIsClosureRef`). Skip the externref type hint for these cases so the new closure wrapper is used.
