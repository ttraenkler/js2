# #942 — JavaScript feature compatibility report ranked by real-world importance

## Problem

There's no single view that shows which JavaScript features js2wasm supports, ranked by how commonly they appear in real-world code. The test262 report groups by spec category, not by developer relevance. A contributor or potential user can't quickly answer "can I use X?"

## What to build

Generate a report (HTML page or markdown) listing every major JavaScript feature with:

1. **Feature name** (e.g. "Arrow functions", "Destructuring", "async/await", "Map/Set", "Proxy")
2. **Real-world importance** — ranked by frequency in NPM packages / GitHub usage:
   - **Critical**: variables, functions, closures, arrays, objects, strings, numbers, control flow, error handling
   - **High**: classes, arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, spread/rest, Promises, async/await, modules
   - **Medium**: generators, iterators, Symbol, Map/Set, WeakMap/WeakSet, Proxy, Reflect, RegExp, TypedArray
   - **Low**: SharedArrayBuffer, Atomics, WeakRef, FinalizationRegistry, Temporal, decorators
3. **Implementation status**: Full / Partial / Stub / None
4. **Test262 pass rate** for that feature (derived from category/feature tag data)
5. **Known limitations** (brief note, e.g. "no eval support", "property descriptors partial")

## Data sources

- Test262 results: `benchmarks/results/test262-report.json` (categories) and `test262-editions.json` (editions)
- Test262 feature tags: parse from test file frontmatter (same as the editions script)
- Implementation status: derive from pass rate thresholds (>80% = Full, >30% = Partial, >0% = Stub, 0% = None)

## Output

- `benchmarks/results/feature-compatibility.json` — machine-readable
- `public/benchmarks/compatibility.html` — visual report page, linked from landing page and dashboard
- Sortable by: importance rank, pass rate, feature name

## Acceptance criteria

- All major JS features listed (~50-80 features)
- Ranked by real-world importance (not alphabetical or spec order)
- Pass rate per feature from live test262 data
- Clear visual status indicators (green/yellow/red/gray)
- Accessible from the landing page
