# #1063 — createMathOperation closure ref (lodash math ops)

## Problem (as filed)

Compiling `node_modules/lodash-es/add.js` via `compileProject({ allowJs: true })` succeeds at the TS/codegen level but produces a Wasm binary that fails validation:

```
WebAssembly.compile(): Compiling function #17:"createMathOperation" failed:
  undeclared reference to function #11 @+3685
```

lodash-es `add.js` is:

```js
var add = createMathOperation(function(augend, addend) {
  return augend + addend;
}, 0);
export default add;
```

`createMathOperation` is a higher-order helper that captures the passed `operator` callback and returns a closure over it. The Wasm emitted references a function slot (#11) that was never actually declared in the module — the closure-capture lowering for a callback parameter isn't registering the function slot correctly.

Surfaced by #1031.

## Root-cause analysis (dev-1056, 2026-04-11)

There are **two independent bugs** that hit the lodash math-ops pattern.

### A) Inliner shared-instr bug (FIXED in this PR)

When an outer factory function (like `make` / `createMathOperation`) is short
enough to become an inlinable candidate AND its body contains `ref.func` or
`struct.new` instructions, the inliner pushed the **same `Instr` object** into
both the original function body and each inline call site. Later,
`dead-elimination.ts` walks every function body and remaps `funcIdx` /
`typeIdx` **in place** — revisiting the shared instr twice, remapping an
already-remapped index, and corrupting the resulting Wasm.

PO's hypothesis ("the callback's function-table index was computed before some
shift/insert operation") is essentially correct: dead-elim remapping was the
"shift" that got applied twice instead of once.

Minimal repro:

```ts
function make(op: any): (v: number) => any {
  return function (v: number): any { return op(v); };
}
function double(x: number): number { return x * 2; }
const f = make(double);
export function test(): number { return f(21); }
```

```
RT: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Compiling function #2:"make"
    failed: undeclared reference to function #0 @+562
```

Traced via debug logging:

```
[DBG closure]  __closure_2 liftedFuncIdx=22 (numImports=18, mod.fns.len=4)
[DBG remap]    fn=make         ref.func 22 → 6     (correct)
[DBG remap]    fn=__module_init ref.func 23 → 7    (correct, unrelated)
[DBG remap]    fn=__module_init ref.func  6 → 0    (WRONG — double remap)
```

The `6` was the result of the previous remap of the shared Instr object; on
the second visit, 6 happened to be in the remap table as an old index for a
since-removed import, so it got remapped *again*.

**Fix:** in `compileCallExpression`'s inlining path
(`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`), shallow-clone each `Instr` as it is
pushed into the caller body. Each inlined copy then owns its own object and
is visited exactly once by subsequent remap passes.

```ts
for (const instr of inlineInfo.body) {
  if (instr.op === "local.get") {
    const mapped = argLocals[(instr as any).index];
    if (mapped !== undefined) {
      fctx.body.push({ op: "local.get", index: mapped });
    } else {
      fctx.body.push({ ...instr });
    }
  } else {
    fctx.body.push({ ...instr });
  }
}
```

Inline candidates have no nested control-flow (`INLINE_DISALLOWED_OPS` blocks
`if`/`block`/`loop`/`try`), so a shallow spread is sufficient — there are no
nested instr arrays to worry about.

### B) Externref closure-captured callee body is empty (FIXED in this PR)

Independent of (A), when the captured `operator` parameter is typed `any`
(which is what JS-parsed lodash sees after `--allowJs` compilation), the
inner closure body compiles without calling `op` at all. The generated
`__closure_N` body extracts `op` from the closure struct to a local and then
unconditionally returns `ref.null extern`:

```wat
(func $__closure_0 (type 6)
  (local $__self_cast (ref null 7))
  (local $op externref)
  local.get 0
  ref.cast (ref 7)
  local.set 2
  local.get 2
  struct.get 7 1
  local.set 3
  ref.null extern      ;; op(v) silently replaced with null
  return
)
```

This is a codegen gap for externref-typed callees that originate from a
closure struct field. The typed variant (where `operator` has a
`(a: number, b: number) => number` contextual type) compiles and runs
correctly — proving the closure ABI and `call_ref` plumbing is fine; only
the externref/`any` path is broken.

**Fix landed (dev-1056, 2026-04-11):** new helper
`tryEmitInlineDynamicCall` in `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`. When the
identifier-callee fallback would otherwise emit `ref.null extern`, and the
callee is a known local/param/captured-global of externref type, emit an
inline dispatch chain against every module closure-struct type whose arity
matches `expr.arguments.length`:

1. Compile callee → `any.convert_extern` → stash in anyref local.
2. Compile each argument into an externref temp local (so each dispatch arm
   can marshal independently without re-evaluating side effects).
3. For each distinct `funcTypeIdx` candidate (deduped the same way
   `emitClosureCallExport` dedupes), emit
   `local.get any; ref.test $self; if (then ... cast ... unbox args ...
   struct.get 0 funcref; ref.cast funcTypeIdx; call_ref; box result) (else chain)`.
4. Terminal else arm: `ref.null.extern` — preserves the existing graceful
   behavior for genuine unknown-function calls.

Arg marshalling unboxes externref → f64 via `__unbox_number` (and
`i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` for i32 params); ref/ref_null params go through
`any.convert_extern` + `ref.cast`. Result coercion boxes f64/i32 via
`__box_number` and wraps ref/ref_null via `extern.convert_any`.

This mirrors the arity-0 `__call_fn_0` export dispatch but specialized per
call site for arity N, so no new module-level export is needed.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Minimal cross-file-style higher-order closure repro compiles + runs
      (`tests/issue-1063.test.ts` — part A)
- [x] Typed `createMathOperation(addOp, 0)` returns `add(6, 7) === 13`
      (part A)
- [x] Untyped `createMathOperation(addOp: any, 0)` returns `add(6, 7) === 13`
      (part B)
- [ ] Lodash-es `add.js` via `compileProject({allowJs:true})` validates and
      `add(6, 4) === 10` (still needs #1060/#1061 multi-file path integration)
- [ ] `tests/stress/lodash-tier1.test.ts` assertion rewritten from "undeclared
      function reference" to `add(6, 4) === 10` (pending #1060/#1061)

## Test Results (this PR)

- Minimal inlined-factory repro (part A):       `f(21) = 42` ✓
- Typed `createMathOperation(addOp, 0)` (A):    `add(6, 7) = 13` ✓
- Untyped `createMathOperation(addOp: any)` (B): `add(6, 7) = 13` ✓
- Two separate inlined closures in mod-init (A): `a(5)+b(3) = 7` ✓

Equivalence tests: no new regressions (same failing/passing counts as
`main` at the PR base for every file checked — verified by `git stash`
baseline compare on `default-parameters.test.ts`, `arrow-call-apply.test.ts`,
`async-function.test.ts`).

## Key files

- `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` — inliner shared-instr fix (part A, this PR)
- `src/codegen/expressions/calls-closures.ts` — externref callee emission path (part B, deferred)
- `src/codegen/closures.ts` — closure body compilation (part B, deferred)
- `src/codegen/dead-elimination.ts` — the double-remap site; no change needed once (A) is fixed

## Notes

- Interacts with #1061 (multi-file `.js` support). Part B is only reachable
  once #1060/#1061 load lodash-es bodies end-to-end.
- PO's "index was computed before some shift/insert" hypothesis was right in
  spirit: the actual shift happens in `dead-elimination.ts` via
  `remapFuncIdxInBody`, and the bug was that the shared instr object got
  visited twice, not that the initial index was wrong.
