# Issue #708: Wasm validation: function index out of bounds

## Problem

167 test262 tests fail with `WebAssembly.instantiate(): function index N out of bounds (M entries)`. The late-import index shifting mechanism in `addUnionImports`, `addStringImports`, and `shiftLateImportIndices` double-shifts `ref.func` instructions when the same body array exists in both `funcStack` and `parentBodiesStack`.

## Root Cause

When a closure is compiled inside a parent function, the parent's function context is saved to both `ctx.funcStack` (the FunctionContext) and `ctx.parentBodiesStack` (the body array). If `addUnionImports` fires during this nested compilation, its shifting code iterated over both structures with **separate tracking sets**:

1. The `shifted` Set tracks `mod.functions`, `currentFunc`, `funcStack` bodies
2. A separate `done` Set tracks `parentBodiesStack` bodies

Since `funcStack[i].body` and `parentBodiesStack[j]` can be the **same array**, the ref.func instruction gets shifted twice by the same delta. For example, `ref.func 5` -> `ref.func 14` (first shift, delta 9) -> `ref.func 23` (second shift, same delta 9).

The same double-shift pattern existed in `addStringImports` and `shiftLateImportIndices` in expressions.ts.

## Fix

Three functions were fixed to use a **single** `shifted` Set across all body-shifting loops:

1. **`addUnionImports`** (index.ts): Replaced the separate `done` Set for `parentBodiesStack` with the existing `shifted` Set. Bodies already shifted via `funcStack` are skipped.

2. **`addStringImports`** (index.ts): Completely rewrote the shifting section to use a proper `shifted` Set, handle `funcStack`, `parentBodiesStack`, and `savedBodies` -- matching the robustness of `addUnionImports`.

3. **`shiftLateImportIndices`** (expressions.ts): Added `funcStack` iteration (was missing entirely) and replaced the separate `done` Set for `parentBodiesStack` with the existing `shifted` Set.

## Files Changed

- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- Fixed `addUnionImports` and `addStringImports` double-shift bugs
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- Fixed `shiftLateImportIndices` double-shift bug, added funcStack handling
- `tests/issue-708-func-index.test.ts` -- Regression test with 4 test cases

## Implementation Summary

- **What was done**: Fixed double-shifting of function indices (ref.func, call instructions) when late imports are added during nested closure compilation. The root cause was that `funcStack.body` and `parentBodiesStack` entries pointed to the same array but were tracked by separate Sets.
- **What worked**: Using a single `shifted` Set across all body-shifting loops prevents any body from being shifted more than once.
- **What didn't**: N/A -- the fix is clean and targeted.
- **Tests passing**: All 4 new regression tests pass. No regressions in equivalence tests.
