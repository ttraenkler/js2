# #388 -- Element access on externref (104 CE)

## Status: open

104 tests fail because element access (bracket notation) on externref values is not supported. Dynamic property access on boxed objects requires the `__extern_get` import.

## Details

When a value is typed as externref (boxed object), bracket notation like `obj[key]` cannot be compiled because externref is opaque to Wasm. The compiler needs to route these accesses through a host import.

```javascript
var obj = getExternalObj();
var val = obj["property"];  // externref element access
var dyn = obj[dynamicKey];  // dynamic key on externref
```

Fix:
1. Detect element access where the base expression type resolves to externref
2. Emit a call to `__extern_get(obj, key)` host import to retrieve the property
3. Handle both string literal and dynamic expression keys

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `obj["prop"]` on externref compiles via `__extern_get`
- [ ] `obj[dynamicKey]` on externref compiles via `__extern_get`
- [ ] Reduce test262 compile errors by ~104
