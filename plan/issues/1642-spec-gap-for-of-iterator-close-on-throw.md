# #1348 — for-of / for-await-of: IteratorClose on abrupt completion

## Problem

`language/statements/for-of`: **362 / 751 pass (48.2%) — 389 fails (304 assertion_fail,
30 runtime_error, 22 type_error, 13 null_deref, 8 other)**.
`language/statements/for-await-of`: **825 / 1234 pass (66.9%) — 409 fails (315 assertion_fail,
50 null_deref, 36 illegal_cast)**.

Spec §14.7.5 (for-of/for-in/for-await-of) requires:
1. `IteratorClose(iterator, abrupt)` must be called when:
   - The body throws.
   - The body executes `break` / `continue` to a label outside the loop.
   - The body executes `return` from the enclosing function.
2. `IteratorClose` calls `iterator.return()` and propagates errors.
3. For for-await-of: the close is awaited.

A large portion of the assertion_fail failures (estimated ~150 of 304) check that the iterator's
`.return()` was called with a specific value when the body throws.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `language/statements/for-of/iterator-close-throw-error.js` passes.
2. `language/statements/for-of/iterator-close-via-break.js` passes.
3. `language/statements/for-of/iterator-close-via-return.js` passes.
4. `language/statements/for-await-of/iterator-close-throw-error.js` passes.
5. Pass-rate for `language/statements/for-of` rises from 48% to ≥75%.

## Files to modify

- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — `compileForOfStatement`, `compileForAwaitOfStatement`
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — exception-region setup around for-of body

## Implementation Plan

### Root cause

The for-of body is currently emitted as a plain Wasm loop without a try/catch around it.
When the body throws, control flows directly out of the loop — the iterator's `.return()` is
never called. Spec requires the loop to be wrapped in a try-catch that catches any abrupt
completion, calls `IteratorClose`, then re-raises.

### Approach

```wasm
;; Pseudocode for compileForOfStatement
local.set $iter
loop $body
  ;; Call iter.next()
  local.get $iter
  call $__iterator_next
  ...
  ;; Bind binding to value
  ;; ─── BEGIN body try block ───
  try_table $loop_close
    <body>
    br $body
  end
  ;; ─── END body — handler ───
  ;; Body threw or break/return — call IteratorClose
  local.get $iter
  call $__iterator_close
  rethrow $exn
end loop
```

For `break`/`continue` to outer label and `return`, intercept the same way: emit a
finally-style cleanup that runs IteratorClose before the actual jump.

For for-await-of: the IteratorClose must be `await`-ed; this requires inserting a yield-suspend
point in the cleanup path.

### Edge cases

- Iterator without `.return()` — IteratorClose is a no-op.
- `.return()` itself throws → re-raise the new error (replacing the original per spec
  §7.4.6 IteratorClose step 6).
- `break` to a label that's still inside the loop body — no close needed.

### Test262 sample

- `test262/test/language/statements/for-of/iterator-close-throw-error.js`
- `test262/test/language/statements/for-of/iterator-close-via-break.js`
- `test262/test/language/statements/for-await-of/iterator-close-throw-error.js`

## Implementation notes (dev-1389, 2026-05-08)

The bulk of the IteratorClose protocol was already wired in #851:

- `compileForOfIterator` (`src/codegen/statements/loops.ts:2701`) wraps the
  block-loop in a Wasm `try`/`catch_all` and pushes a `finallyStack` entry
  that emits `__iterator_return` on `return`, outer-`break`, and
  outer-`continue`.
- `compileForOfDirectIterator` does the same for direct iterator structs.
- The post-loop check inlines `__iterator_return` on inner-`break`.

The remaining failure surface for these tests was traced to a different
root cause: **void IIFE inlining did not block-wrap its body**.
`compileCallExpression` in `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` had two
inline paths — one for value-returning IIFEs (which patches `return` →
`local.set + br <depth>` after wrapping the body in a block) and one for
void IIFEs (which simply compiled the body inline). The void path
re-emitted `return` instructions from the IIFE body verbatim, so a
`return;` inside

```js
(function () { for (var x of it) { ...; return; } }());
```

became a Wasm `return` from the *enclosing* function, dropping the
post-IIFE asserts that verify `returnCount === 1`.

The fix mirrors the value-IIFE branch:

1. Push the IIFE body onto a fresh Instr array.
2. Save `fctx.returnType`, set it to `null` so any `return <expr>` drops
   its value.
3. Increment `fctx.blockDepth`, compile the body, decrement again.
4. Walk the block body and replace every `return` with `br <depth>`,
   undoing tail-call optimization (`return_call` → `call` + `br`).
5. Wrap the patched block in a `block { ... }` Instr.

The tail-call handling is necessary because
`compileReturnStatement` may have collapsed the final `call + return`
into `return_call`, which inside an IIFE block would still leak through
to the outer function.

### Files changed

- `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` — void IIFE body now block-wrapped
  with `return → br` patching (mirroring the existing value-IIFE branch).

### Tests

- `tests/issue-1348.test.ts` — 5 focused regression tests covering
  bare `return` in void IIFE, `return` inside a for-loop body, nested
  void IIFEs, and void arrow IIFEs.
- `test262/test/language/statements/for-of/iterator-close-via-return.js`
  goes from `fail` (returned 0 — early return) → `pass` after the fix.
- The other three iterator-close tests (`-via-break`, `-via-continue`,
  `-via-throw`) already passed and continue to pass.

### Estimated impact

The single root cause unlocks all `iterator-close-via-return` flavoured
tests. Several other for-of failures are unrelated (destructuring, TS
type checker rejections) and tracked elsewhere.
