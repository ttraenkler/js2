# #727 -- Sub-classify assertion failures (11,480 tests return wrong values)

## Status: done

## Problem

11,480 tests fail with "assertion failed" messages that include line information, meaning the test compiled and ran but returned the wrong value. This is the single largest failure bucket and needs sub-classification to identify which codegen features cause the most failures.

## Results

### Broad Groups (11,480 total)

| Group | Count | Pct |
|-------|------:|----:|
| Error throws | 4,152 | 36.2% |
| Object metadata | 1,250 | 10.9% |
| Class features | 1,166 | 10.2% |
| Prototype chain | 463 | 4.0% |
| Array operations | 444 | 3.9% |
| Object operations | 405 | 3.5% |
| Type coercion | 398 | 3.5% |
| Temporal | 367 | 3.2% |
| Type checks | 353 | 3.1% |
| Async | 350 | 3.0% |
| Function | 234 | 2.0% |
| Expressions | 216 | 1.9% |
| Property descriptors | 173 | 1.5% |
| eval | 173 | 1.5% |
| Operators | 154 | 1.3% |
| Generators | 146 | 1.3% |
| Numeric | 115 | 1.0% |
| Iterators | 100 | 0.9% |
| Other (< 1% each) | 498 | 4.3% |

### Top 15 Sub-patterns (>200 tests each)

| Sub-pattern | Count | Pct | Issue |
|-------------|------:|----:|-------|
| assert.throws(TypeError) | 1,821 | 15.9% | #726, #728 (existing) |
| class feature (generic assert) | 1,161 | 10.1% | #729 (new) |
| assert.throws(ReferenceError) | 846 | 7.4% | #723 (existing, TDZ subset) |
| assert.throws(Test262Error) [expected exc. not thrown] | 708 | 6.2% | #730 (new) |

| instanceof check | 276 | 2.4% | #738 (new) |
| Object.defineProperty (generic assert) | 262 | 2.3% | #739 (new) |

### Key Findings

1. **Error throws dominate (36.2%)**: TypeError (15.9%), ReferenceError (7.4%), Test262Error/missing-throw (6.2%), RangeError (3.9%), SyntaxError (2.8%). The compiler fails to throw correct error types in many cases.

2. **Class features (10.1%)**: 1,161 tests fail on class body semantics -- field init, method definition, static members, class expressions. Separate from prototype chain issues.

3. **.name property (4.9%)**: 558 tests. Compiler does not set .name on function/class objects.

4. **hasOwnProperty (4.5%)**: 520 tests. Object model does not distinguish own vs. inherited properties correctly.

5. **RangeError (3.9%)**: Missing range validation in built-in method implementations.
