# #475 — Narrow negative test skip (892 tests)

892 tests are skipped as "negative test" but #402 and #418 already improved negative test handling. Investigate why these are still skipped — the `shouldSkip` or `handleNegativeTest` logic may have a gap. Many negative tests should now be properly classified (PASS if compilation fails with expected error, FAIL if it succeeds).
