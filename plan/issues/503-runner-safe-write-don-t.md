# #503 — Runner safe-write: don't corrupt report on crash

## Status: in-review
When the test262 runner is killed mid-run (SIGTERM, container rebuild, etc.), it overwrites `test262-results.jsonl` and `test262-report.json` with partial/empty data, destroying the previous baseline.

## Approach

1. Each run writes to a timestamped file: `runs/{timestamp}-results.jsonl`
2. `test262-results.jsonl` and `test262-report.json` are only updated on successful completion (copy from run file)
3. If the run is killed, the main files remain untouched — only the run-specific file has partial data
4. The `runs/` directory preserves all historical data (never delete run files)

### Also fix:
- HANGING_TESTS check must run BEFORE `handleNegativeTest` — negative test handling compiles the test, which is where the hang occurs
- Deduplicate JSONL when building the report (last entry per file wins)

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

All JSONL and report writes during a test262 run now go to timestamped files under `benchmarks/results/runs/` (e.g., `2026-03-18T12-00-00-000Z-results.jsonl`). The main `test262-results.jsonl` and `test262-report.json` are only updated via `copyFileSync` after the run completes successfully. If the runner crashes mid-run, only the run-specific file has partial data -- the main files remain untouched.

### What was done
- Added `RUNS_DIR`, `RUN_JSONL`, `RUN_REPORT` constants with timestamped paths
- Redirected all mid-run writes (`writeFileSync`, `appendFileSync`) from `JSONL_PATH`/`REPORT_PATH` to `RUN_JSONL`/`RUN_REPORT`
- Added promotion step at end: `copyFileSync(RUN_JSONL, JSONL_PATH)` and `copyFileSync(RUN_REPORT, REPORT_PATH)`
- Resume/recheck still reads from `JSONL_PATH` (stable baseline), seeds `RUN_JSONL` with carried-forward data
- JSONL deduplication was already in place (line ~237, last entry per file wins)

### Files changed
- `scripts/run-test262.ts`

### Notes
- The "HANGING_TESTS check before handleNegativeTest" item from the issue was not addressed as it was not present in the current codebase (no `handleNegativeTest` or `HANGING_TESTS` references found in `run-test262.ts`)
- Used `copyFileSync` rather than `renameSync` to keep the run file intact in `runs/` for historical preservation
