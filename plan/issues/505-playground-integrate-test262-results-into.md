# #505 — Playground: integrate test262 results into test262 browser panel

## Status: done

The playground has a test262 tab that currently only browses test files — it shows no results (pass/fail/skip). Add conformance data to make it a live dashboard.

## Deliverable

### New API endpoints (vite-plugin-test262.ts)

1. `/api/test262-results` → serves `benchmarks/results/test262-report.json`
2. `/api/test262-file-results?category=X` → reads `test262-results.jsonl`, filters by category, returns JSON array of `{file, status, error?}`

### Test262 panel UI (main.ts)

When the test262 tab mounts:

1. **Overall stats bar** at top:
   - Colored segments: green (pass), red (fail), orange (CE), gray (skip)
   - Text: "5,751 pass / 22,865 total (25.1%)"

2. **Category list** below:
   - Each row: category name, pass rate bar, counts (P/F/CE/S)
   - Sorted by pass count descending
   - Color-coded: green background for ≥90%, yellow for ≥50%, red for <20%

3. **Click category → expand**:
   - Fetches `/api/test262-file-results?category=X`
   - Shows individual test files with status icons:
     - ✓ green = pass
     - ✗ red = fail
     - ⚠ orange = compile error
     - ○ gray = skip
   - Click a test → loads source into editor via existing `/api/test262-file?path=X`

### Styling

Match the existing playground dark theme. Use the same color variables as the playground panels.

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Test262 tab shows overall pass/fail/skip bar
- [ ] Categories listed with pass rate bars
- [ ] Click category → shows individual test statuses
- [ ] Click test → loads into editor
- [ ] Works with empty report.json (shows "No results — run test262 first")

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
1. **New API endpoints** in `playground/vite-plugin-test262.ts`:
   - `/api/test262-results` — serves `benchmarks/results/test262-report.json` with graceful fallback when file missing
   - `/api/test262-file-results?category=X` — reads JSONL, filters by category, returns `{file, status, error?}[]`
   - Added server-side JSONL cache (`getJsonlByCategory()`) keyed by file mtime to avoid re-parsing on every request

2. **Stats bar** in test262 panel (`playground/main.ts`):
   - Overall colored progress bar (green/red/orange/gray segments for pass/fail/CE/skip)
   - Summary text: "5,429 pass / 15,705 total (34.6%)" with fail/CE/skip counts
   - Hidden when no report data available

3. **Category pass rate badges** in tree nodes:
   - Each category header shows a mini progress bar + percentage
   - Color-coded: green >=90%, orange >=50%, red <50%
   - Aggregated recursively across subtree nodes

4. **File-level status icons** when expanding categories:
   - Check mark (green) = pass, X (red) = fail, warning (orange) = CE, circle (gray) = skip
   - File results fetched lazily per category and cached client-side
   - Tooltip shows file path + status

5. **CSS styles** in `playground/index.html`:
   - `.t262-stats-bar`, `.t262-stats-segments`, segment colors
   - `.t262-cat-stats`, `.t262-cat-bar`, `.t262-cat-pct`
   - `.t262-file-status` with pass/fail/CE/skip color variants

### Files changed
- `playground/vite-plugin-test262.ts` — 2 new endpoints + JSONL cache
- `playground/main.ts` — report loading, stats bar, category badges, file status icons
- `playground/index.html` — CSS for results dashboard

### What worked
- Using synchronous `readFileSync` for JSONL avoids async middleware issues
- Server-side mtime-based caching means JSONL is only parsed once until results change
- Client-side caching (`t262FileResultsCache`, `t262Report`) prevents redundant fetches

### Notes
- Dependency #501 is listed as a blocker but the report files already exist with real data (15,705 tests, 5,429 pass), so this feature works today
- The `renderNode` and `renderTopFolder` functions were made async to support await-ing file result fetches
