# #800 -- Audit: replace runtime emulation with compile-time resolution

## Problem

Several codegen paths add runtime data structures or checks that could be resolved statically at compile time. These add overhead to all code, even code that never uses the feature. The compiler should resolve these at compile time and emit the optimal code directly.

## Known candidates to audit

### Null guards (emitNullCheckThrow / emitGuardedRefCast)
- Every property access emits a runtime null check + if/else branch
- The compiler often knows the value is non-null from type information or prior checks
- Opportunity: skip null guards when the compiler can prove non-null (e.g., just constructed, already guarded, let binding with initializer)

### TDZ flags (hoistLetConstWithTdz)
- Every let/const variable gets an i32 "initialized" flag local
- Every access checks the flag at runtime
- The compiler walks the AST and knows the source position of every access relative to every declaration. Three cases:
  1. **Access after declaration** (straight-line code) → guaranteed initialized, no check needed
  2. **Access before declaration** (straight-line code) → always ReferenceError, emit throw directly, no flag needed
  3. **Access in closure or conditional** → can't know statically, keep runtime flag check
- Cases 1 and 2 are the vast majority — zero runtime overhead for most let/const accesses

### widenNonDefaultableTypes post-pass
- Widens ALL ref types to ref_null across the entire module
- This is a sledgehammer fix for uninitialized locals
- Opportunity: only widen locals that are actually used before assignment (requires dataflow analysis)

### valueOf/toString coercion
- Every comparison/arithmetic emits a full valueOf call chain at runtime
- For known numeric types (literal numbers, i32 typed), this is unnecessary
- Opportunity: skip coercion when both operands are known-numeric at compile time

### typeof operator
- Emits host import call at runtime
- The compiler knows the type — emit the string constant directly
- Already partially done, audit for remaining runtime paths

### arguments object
- Creates a vec struct and copies all params at every function entry that uses `arguments`
- Opportunity: if only `arguments.length` is used, emit the constant. If only `arguments[0]` is used, emit `local.get 0` directly.

### Multi-struct dispatch (emitNullGuardedStructGet)
- Tries multiple struct types at runtime for property access
- Opportunity: when the compiler knows the exact type from the call site or declaration, skip the dispatch chain

## Approach

1. For each candidate, check if the compiler has enough static information to resolve at compile time
2. Add fast paths that skip runtime checks when types are statically known
3. Keep runtime fallbacks for genuinely dynamic cases (externref, union types, any)

## Files to audit
- `src/codegen/property-access.ts` — null guards, multi-struct dispatch
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — typeof, valueOf coercion, arguments access
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — TDZ checks
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — widenNonDefaultableTypes, arguments setup
- `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` — arithmetic coercion

## Acceptance criteria
- Each candidate evaluated for static resolution feasibility
- Fast paths added where type information is available
- No regressions — runtime fallbacks preserved for dynamic cases
- Measurable reduction in generated code size and/or test262 improvement
