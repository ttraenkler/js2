# #1059 — Parallel tsc — stress test the inter-module coordination primitive

## Context

- js2wasm compiles TypeScript to WasmGC modules with OCAP-based isolation.
- Each module boundary is a capability boundary by design.
- Test runners already run embarrassingly parallel — no coordination needed there.
- A TypeScript compiler workload is **not** embarrassingly parallel: files have import graphs, and type inference flows across module boundaries.

## The coordination problem

Run N js2wasm-compiled tsc instances concurrently against a single TypeScript project. The instances must produce the same output as a single-threaded compile — but the work is not independent:

> Instance A checking `Button.tsx` needs exported types from `utils/types.ts` that instance B is checking simultaneously.

Three approaches to explore:

1. **Partition by dependency layer via topological sort.** Compute the import DAG once, then run each level in parallel. Works for strict layered architectures; degenerates for graphs with mutual imports or barrel files.
2. **Precompute a read-only type declaration cache.** Serialize the declarations of every exported type once, then hand each instance an immutable view. Pays a one-time serialization cost but eliminates coordination at checking time.
3. **Accept redundant computation for shallow import graphs.** For small projects where depth is low, let each instance re-check imported types independently. Cheaper to implement; doesn't scale to real codebases.

The interesting outcome isn't picking a winner — it's understanding which approach produces correct output under what project shapes, and what the coordination primitive looks like when it's abstracted out of tsc's specifics.

## Why this matters beyond tsc

- The coordination pattern required here is the **same primitive the web OS needs for AI agents passing typed data between sandboxed modules**. An agent producing a structured response for another agent to consume has the same shape as a compiler instance emitting type declarations another instance will read.
- Solving it for tsc validates the architecture for the general case. tsc is dense, well-understood, and has a known-correct reference implementation — a much better validation target than building an agent protocol from first principles.
- Parallel tsc is a concrete stress test of inter-module coordination, not just a compiler benchmark. The answer it produces is "does our module-boundary capability story hold up when modules need to exchange typed data under concurrency," which is a foundational question for the OS layer.

## Explicit non-goal

**Beating typescript-go on a 10,000-file monorepo is not the goal.** The goal is **correctness and architectural validation**: does js2wasm-compiled tsc produce correct output when run in parallel with shared type dependencies? If yes, the coordination primitive works. If no, the failure mode tells us where the abstraction leaks and what the web OS needs to fix before it ships.

## Dependencies

- **#1058** (compile TypeScript compiler to Wasm — single-instance self-hosting stress test) must land at least Tier 3 before this issue is actionable. Running N instances of a compiler that doesn't yet compile on its own is meaningless.

## Status

Backlog placeholder. When #1058 reaches Tier 3 (scanner + parser compiles and can parse a real `.ts` file), promote this issue to ready/ and fill in:
- Concrete test project selection (real small TypeScript codebase with known-correct output)
- Acceptance criteria per coordination strategy
- Benchmark harness layout
- Expected failure modes and what each tells us about the web OS primitive
