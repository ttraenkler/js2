# Issue 105: Test262 — built-ins/Map, built-ins/Set, built-ins/Promise

## Summary

Add test262 coverage for the collection and async built-ins that the compiler
already supports: `Map`, `Set`, and `Promise`.

## Categories to add

| Category | Feature | Status in compiler |
|---|---|---|
| `built-ins/Map/prototype/set` | `map.set(k, v)` | ✅ done (#54) |
| `built-ins/Map/prototype/get` | `map.get(k)` | ✅ done (#54) |
| `built-ins/Map/prototype/has` | `map.has(k)` | ✅ done (#54) |
| `built-ins/Map/prototype/delete` | `map.delete(k)` | ✅ done (#54) |
| `built-ins/Map/prototype/clear` | `map.clear()` | ✅ done (#54) |
| `built-ins/Map/prototype/size` | `map.size` | ✅ done (#54) |
| `built-ins/Set/prototype/add` | `set.add(v)` | ✅ done (#54) |
| `built-ins/Set/prototype/has` | `set.has(v)` | ✅ done (#54) |
| `built-ins/Set/prototype/delete` | `set.delete(v)` | ✅ done (#54) |
| `built-ins/Set/prototype/clear` | `set.clear()` | ✅ done (#54) |
| `built-ins/Set/prototype/size` | `set.size` | ✅ done (#54) |
| `built-ins/Promise/all` | `Promise.all([...])` | ✅ done (#63) |
| `built-ins/Promise/race` | `Promise.race([...])` | ✅ done (#63) |
| `built-ins/Promise/resolve` | `Promise.resolve(v)` | ✅ done (#30) |
| `built-ins/Promise/reject` | `Promise.reject(e)` | ✅ done (#30) |

## Approach

1. Add categories to `TEST_CATEGORIES`
2. Run and add skip filters for:
   - Map/Set iteration (`forEach`, `keys()`, `values()`, `entries()`)
   - Map/Set construction from iterable argument
   - WeakMap, WeakSet (not supported)
   - Promise executor throwing synchronously
   - `Promise.allSettled`, `Promise.any` (not yet supported)
