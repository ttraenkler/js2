# #3544 — dynamic `.call`/`.apply` on callables answers undefined (standalone)

## Traced mechanism (WAT-verified 2026-07-23, exact chain)

`var s = String.prototype.slice; s.call(undefined, 0)` compiles to:

1. `__call_m_call_2(s, thisArg, box(0))` — builds key `"call"` + an `$ObjVec`
   argvec `[thisArg, arg0]` — then
2. `__extern_method_call(s, "call", argvec)` (`src/codegen/object-runtime.ts`
   ~4055). Receiver `s` is a **builtin proto-method closure** (a funcref-wrapper
   struct minted by `ensureStandaloneNativeMethodClosure`,
   `src/codegen/native-proto.ts` ~417 — `$__proto_method_<brand>_slice`), which
   is neither `$Object` nor `$Vec` nor a CAPTURING closure, so the else-arm
   chain (vec → closure-prop-carrier) falls through to **`ref.null.extern` —
   silent undefined. The call never dispatches.**

Probe matrix (r=1 threw ✓spec / r=3 silent no-throw ✗):
`String.slice/concat .call(undefined)` ✗ · `Uint8Array.filter.call({})` ✗ ·
`ArrayBuffer.slice.call({})` ✗ · `Promise.resolve.call(undefined)` ✗ ·
`Date.setTime.call({})` ✓ (Date routes elsewhere — statically resolved).

## Why ONE fix covers the cluster

The minted closures ALREADY have TypeError-bearing bodies: wired members carry
real receiver checks, un-wired members carry the #2984 refusal body
(`"<Builtin>.prototype.<m> is not yet implemented in --target standalone"` — a
REAL catchable TypeError). The cluster-3 tests assert only the CONSTRUCTOR
(`assert.throws(TypeError, () => m.call(badReceiver))`), so **dispatching the
call is sufficient to flip them — wired or refusal alike**. The gap is purely
the `.call`/`.apply` routing arm in `__extern_method_call`, not 232 per-builtin
receiver checks. (Harness `assert.throws` ctor-identity for a thrown TypeError
verified working — probe3, 2026-07-23.)

## Fix sketch (slice 1: `.call`)

In `__extern_method_call`'s else-arm chain (COMPOSED like #3537 — do not edit
closure-props.ts): a new leading arm
`if (name == "call" && __is_callable(recv)) → __dispatch_fn_call(recv, argvec)`:
- `__is_callable` — the #3140 `buildClosureRefTestArms` callable-gate
  classification already enumerates every funcref-wrapper struct (it powers
  `__bind_dyn`); reuse it.
- `__dispatch_fn_call(recv, argvec)` — thisArg = argvec[0], rest = argvec[1..]
  re-pushed into a fresh `$ObjVec`, then `__apply_closure(recv, thisArg, rest)`.
  Native-string compare for the `"call"` key via the `fillBuiltinFnMeta`
  classify pattern (same as #3537's "length" refusal).
- Arm ORDER: before the closure-prop-carrier arm (a capturing closure's
  `f.call(x)` must invoke `f`, not consult its expando bag; an own expando
  literally named "call" is pathological and broken today anyway).
- `.apply` = follow-on slice (needs array-arg spreading; check what the
  DONE #1596 static path already has as helpers).

## ⚠ Measured-floor HAZARD — must be quantified before PR (do NOT skip)

Dispatching makes the #2984 **refusal-stub bodies reachable**: today
`m.call(x)` on an un-wired member silently answers undefined; after the fix it
THROWS the refusal TypeError. That is spec-directionally better (fail-loud) and
flips the cluster-3 assert.throws tests green, but any today-passing standalone
test that *tolerates* the silent undefined would flip pass→fail at module init.
The #2984 comment explicitly measured this class of regression once before
(`hasOwnProperty.call` idioms rely on the null-return fall-through of
`emitReflectiveNativeProtoClosureCall` — note that is a DIFFERENT, static
route; verify it stays untouched). Validation protocol (the #3537 template):
1. stride-8 floor run (main vs main+fix) — regressions MUST be ~0; every
   regression individually triaged (a refusal-throw regression means the
   member needs a real wired body or the arm needs a narrower gate);
2. re-run the 458 #3468-cliff sample on routing-harness ± fix — report
   measured flips ONLY (coordinator directive: a sibling agent's 29% signature
   share measured 2/198 — size on flips, never share);
3. `hasOwnProperty.call` / `propertyIsEnumerable.call` harness idioms explicitly
   re-tested.

## WIP FINDING (2026-07-23, fable-exposed) — prototype built; convention split found

A working prototype of the arm exists on branch **`issue-3544-call-dispatch`**
(pushed to the fork; stacked on `issue-3537-vec-expando-props`; NOT a PR):
`src/codegen/fn-call-dispatch.ts` (reserve/fill: `__fn_call_name_gate`,
`__is_fn_callable`, `__fn_call_invoke`) + arm wiring. Measured behavior:

- `Promise.resolve.call(undefined, 1)` **now throws ✓** — the arm + name gate +
  invoke work end-to-end for static-shape builtin closures.
- `String.prototype.slice.call(undefined, 0)` **still silent ✗** — and the WHY
  is the key discovery: **two calling conventions coexist.**
  - Ordinary user closures: lifted sig `(self, ...args)`; `this` flows via the
    `__current_this` global → `.call(t, a)` must split argvec: thisArg=t,
    rest=[a] → `__apply_closure(m, t, [a])` (what the prototype does).
  - Builtin proto-method closures (`ensureStandaloneNativeMethodClosure`):
    lifted sig `(self, THIS-AS-PARAM, ...args)` — userParams `[this, p0, …]`
    (`native-proto.ts` ~461). `.call(t, a)` must pass the ORIGINAL argvec
    `[t, a]` (this folded as first arg) padded to the member's paramSlots.
    The prototype's uniform split mis-arities these into the wrong
    `__call_fn_method_N` (no matching per-type arm at that N) → silent null →
    the observed undefined. `emitReflectiveNativeProtoClosureCall` (the static
    `hasOwnProperty.call` route) is the existing precedent for the folded
    convention — study it before finishing.
- Also fixed en route: `__is_fn_callable` must use PER-CONCRETE-TYPE arms over
  `ctx.closureInfoByTypeIdx` (the same set `__call_fn_method_N` tests), NOT
  `collectClosureBaseWrapperTypeIdxs` — the base-root walk misses the
  proto-method wrapper structs (measured: gate matched Promise, missed String).

**Next implementer:** distinguish the two conventions inside
`__fn_call_invoke` — e.g. a fill-time `ref.test` chain over the proto-method
wrapper types (they are enumerable at finalize from the funcMap
`__proto_method_*` names / a registry added at mint time) choosing
argvec-as-is + pad vs split; or normalize the convention at mint time. Then
run the pre-authorized measurement (stride-8 floor + full-458 cliff; decision
rule: floor≈0 → ship; material loss → STOP, report per-member).

## Implementation (2026-07-23, fable-3544) — convention discrimination landed

The predecessor's blocker (uniform argvec split mis-arities folded-convention
proto-methods) is resolved inside `fillFnCallDispatch`'s `__fn_call_invoke`
fill (`src/codegen/fn-call-dispatch.ts`), no new modules:

- **WHY a runtime type test and not a mint-time normalization**: the folded
  convention (`(self, THIS-AS-PARAM, ...args)`) is the SAME contract the
  static reflective route already codifies (`emitReflectiveNativeProtoClosureCall`
  and the #2193 PR-B `m.call(t, a)` → `m(t, a)` rewrite keyed on
  `nativeProtoReceiverClosureStructTypes`). Normalizing at mint time would
  change every existing call surface of every proto-method closure (static
  calls, gOPD descriptor `.get` invokes, `__bind_dyn`) for one dynamic route —
  the discrimination belongs at the one place the convention is ambiguous.
- **The discrimination set**: `nativeProtoReceiverClosureStructTypes ∩
  builtinFnMetaByTypeIdx` — meta subtypes ONLY. native-proto.ts registers
  BOTH the base signature wrapper and the meta subtype in the receiver set,
  but base wrappers are signature-SHARED with ordinary user closures (#1712:
  capture structs subtype their signature wrapper), so `ref.test`ing a base
  wrapper would mis-fold a user `f.call(x)`. Meta-only stays complete because
  every proto-method VALUE is minted as its unique per-(brand, member) meta
  subtype (factory return type + #2963 singleton materializer).
- **The pad**: folded dispatch passes the ORIGINAL argvec `[t, ...args]`
  padded with undefined to the closure's `paramTypes.length` (this + arg
  slots). `__apply_closure` dispatches on VECTOR LENGTH, and
  `__call_fn_method_N` only carries arms for closures with arity ≤ N — an
  unpadded len-2 vec for a 3-param slice closure lands in
  `__call_fn_method_2` with no matching arm (the measured silent undefined).
  Over-length vecs need no truncation (extras plumbing absorbs them).

Probe matrix after the fix (was: all ✗ silent): `String.slice/concat
.call(undefined)` ✓threw · `Uint8Array.filter.call({})` ✓ ·
`ArrayBuffer.slice.call({})` ✓ · `Promise.resolve.call(undefined)` ✓ ·
`Date.setTime.call({})` ✓ (unchanged) · user-closure
`add.call(undefined, 2, 3) === 5` ✓ (split path intact).

Control probes against the pre-fix compiler surfaced the main-side truth:
dynamic `.call` results USED as strings TRAP uncatchably on main
("dereferencing a null pointer") — the fix converts those to catchable
refusal TypeErrors; `hasOwnProperty.call(o, "x")` answered silently-wrong
`false` for an EXISTING property (only the static syntactic route works).
