# Issue #221: Unsupported call expression patterns

## Status: in-review
## Problem

~200 of 724 "Unsupported call expression" errors come from patterns that should be addressable:

1. `.call()` and `.apply()` patterns -- `obj.method.call(thisArg, ...)`
2. Comma operator indirect calls -- `(0, foo)()`
3. Method calls on returned values (chained calls) -- `foo().bar()`

## Implementation

### Pattern 1: `.call()` on known functions

Added handling in `compileCallExpression` for `.call()` method on PropertyAccessExpression:

- **Standalone function**: `fn.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2)` -- evaluates and drops thisArg, then calls `fn(arg1, arg2)` directly. Works for both regular functions and closures.
- **Method call**: `obj.method.call(otherObj, arg1)` -- compiles as method call with `otherObj` as the receiver (first argument to the wasm function).

### Pattern 2: Comma operator indirect calls

Added handling for `(0, foo)()` and `(expr, fn)()` patterns. Unwraps parenthesized comma expressions, evaluates the left side for side effects (dropping its value), then recursively compiles a call with the right side as the callee.

### Pattern 3: Chained method calls

Already working -- the TypeScript type checker resolves the return type of call expressions, so `foo().bar()` already works when `foo()` returns a class/struct instance.

## Files changed

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- Added `.call()` handling and comma operator call unwrapping in `compileCallExpression`
- `tests/equivalence.test.ts` -- Added 6 new tests

## Tests

- comma operator indirect call: `(0, fn)()`
- comma operator indirect call with side effects
- fn.call() with thisArg dropped
- fn.call() with no extra args
- fn.call() with undefined thisArg
- chained method call on returned value
