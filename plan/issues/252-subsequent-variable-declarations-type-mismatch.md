# Issue #252: Subsequent variable declarations type mismatch (var re-declaration)

## Status: done

## Summary

15 tests fail with "Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type. Variable 'x' must be of type 'number', but here has type 'string'". JavaScript allows `var` re-declarations with different value types. TypeScript rejects this even in allowJs mode.

This overlaps with #180 (JS var re-declaration type mismatch, status: Review) but covers additional patterns not addressed there.

## Root Cause

In JavaScript, `var x = 1; var x = "hello";` is legal -- `var` declarations are hoisted and the second declaration is just an assignment. TypeScript's type checker flags this as an error because the types are incompatible.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- TypeScript diagnostic suppression
- Tests affected: ~15 compile errors

## Expected Impact

Fixes ~15 compile errors.

## Suggested Approach

1. Suppress TS diagnostic for "Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type" (TS2403) in allowJs mode
2. In the codegen, when a var is re-declared with a different type, use the broader type (externref) for the local
3. May already be partially addressed by #180 -- check status and extend if needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] var re-declarations with different types compile in allowJs mode
- [ ] Variable uses the correct value after re-declaration
- [ ] At least 10 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Notes

TS diagnostic code 2403 ("Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type") was already in the `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` set from a prior sprint (#180). The codegen handles var re-declarations correctly -- subsequent `var` declarations are treated as assignments. Equivalence test added.

## Complexity: S
