<!--
2026-09-23 budget rationale (slice 4, wide carrier). Everything that decides
or emits wide-BigInt code lives in the two new leaves
`src/codegen/bigint-wide.ts` and `src/codegen/bigint-wide-parse.ts`. What is
left in the god-files is one guarded call per entry point, plus its import:

- `expressions.ts::compileExpressionInner` +4: the constant-fold hook, placed
  before the BigInt-literal arm. It has to come before that arm, because the
  arm lowers a literal straight to an i64.
- `call-receiver-method.ts::compileReceiverMethodCall` +2: the narrowed
  `x.toString(r)` hook. It sits inside the static-bigint arm, which owns the
  `radixLocalIdx` it forwards.
- `call-identifier.ts::compileIdentifierCall` +2: the `BigInt(x)` hook, which
  needs that function's `expectedType`.
- `registry/imports.ts::addUnionImportsAsNativeFuncs` +3: `$BigInt` loses
  `final`, and `$BigIntWide` is registered in the same block that mints
  `$BigInt`. Doing both in that one block is what keeps a provider and its
  consumer canonically identical across a link.
- `context/types.ts` +3: the two optional type-index fields and their doc
  comment.
- coercion-sites `bigint-wide.ts` `__unbox_number` +1: the Number branch of
  `__bigint_carrier_neg`. Unary `-` on an operand the checker typed as bigint
  but that holds a Number (a JSDoc cast) must still be ToNumeric, then
  negated. It is a runtime-helper body, not a codegen coercion, so it cannot
  go through the codegen coercion engine.
-->


<!--
2026-09-21 budget rationale (slice 3). All three decisions — which operand
pairs are proven BigInt carriers, which function bodies are BigInt kernels,
and how a carrier pair's `===`/arithmetic lowers — live in the new leaf
`src/codegen/bigint-carrier-operands.ts`, and the two `typeof` folds moved into
the existing leaf `src/codegen/typeof-static-folds.ts`. That extraction took
the growth from +159 lines across four god-files (and +25/+17/+16 on three
functions) down to what is listed here. What remains cannot move:

- `context/types.ts` +10 — one `CodegenContext` field
  (`bigIntKernelFunctions`) and its doc comment. A context field has to be
  declared on the context.
- `context/create-context.ts::createCodegenContext` +1 — that field's
  initialiser, one line in the object literal.
- `declarations.ts` +10 — two call sites into `recordBigIntKernel`, in the two
  places a function's RESULT type is decided (`inferredNumericResultType` and
  `resolveGenericDeclarationCallSiteTypes`), plus the `stmt` parameter those
  call sites thread through. Both already own the `params`/`results` locals the
  predicate reads; hoisting them would duplicate the signature resolution.
- `binary-ops.ts` +7 — the numeric-hint branch (the hint local and its
  ternary arm) and two one-line calls into the leaf. The hint is computed from
  six sibling flags that exist only in `compileBinaryExpression`.
-->

<!--
2026-09-23 budget rationale (slice 4 groundwork). `String(x)` needs an i64
arm at its own call site in `compileIdentifierCall` (+3 lines: the guard and
its comment; +1 import). The formatter choice itself lives in the leaf
`bigint-string-context.ts`, whose unbranded-i64 fallback is the one
`number_toString` site the coercion gate counts: a native `type i64 = number`
has no exact bigint formatter to route to, and before this it produced an
invalid module rather than a string.
-->

<!--
2026-09-20 budget rationale (slice 2). The DECISION (which formatter a
bigint-typed operand gets, and the native-format gate that keeps the JS-host
lane byte-inert) lives entirely in the new leaf
`src/codegen/bigint-string-context.ts`. What remains in the two god-files is
call-site glue that cannot move: five separate string contexts in
`string-ops.ts` (native operand arm, template span, `String.raw` substitution,
and both `+` concat operands) each already own their numeric lowering inline,
and the three demand blocks in `import-collector.ts::unifiedVisitNode` sit
inside existing `number_toString` registrations whose `spanType`/`leftType`/
`stringArgFact` locals they reuse — hoisting them out would duplicate the type
queries. Measured after extracting everything extractable into the leaf:
string-ops +25, import-collector +7, `compileStringBinaryOp` +9,
`unifiedVisitNode` +6.

# #6656 — standalone BigInt beyond i64

`--target standalone` represents a JS `bigint` as a **branded i64**: the
`ValType` is `{ kind: "i64", bigint: true }` (`BIGINT_I64`,
`src/codegen/binary-ops.ts:200`) on the stack and in locals, and a
module-private one-field `$BigInt` struct (`ctx.nativeBigIntTypeIdx`,
minted in `src/codegen/registry/imports.ts:1264`) when the value has to
travel as `externref`/`anyref`.

Consequences: `864n * 10n ** 19n` wraps modulo 2^64 to
`6923773503929843712`, so Temporal's ±8.64e21 ns epoch-limit checks never
fire; and — the part that was **not** previously attributed — even values
that DO fit in i64 print through `f64`, so every bigint above 2^53 is
printed rounded.

## Measurements (base `bccd46c5`, `--target standalone`, `hostBridge: off`)

Probes `.tmp/s74/probes/bi1.mts`, `bi2.mts`, `bi4.mts`. "node=" is Node 22
evaluating the same source.

### A. Range (`bi1.mts`) — 12 of 18 wrong

| expression | standalone | Node |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `2n ** 64n` | `0` | `18446744073709551616` |
| `864n * 10n ** 19n` | `6923773503929844000` | `8640000000000000000000` |
| `Number(2n ** 70n)` | `0` | `1.1805916207174113e+21` |
| `String(2n ** 70n)` | `0` | `1180591620717411303424` |
| `(2n ** 63n) > (2n ** 62n)` | `false` | `true` |
| `(2n ** 64n) === 0n` | `true` | `false` |
| `BigInt("18446744073709551617")` | `1` | `18446744073709551617` |
| `(2n**70n) / (2n**35n)` | `0` | `34359738368` |
| `BigInt.asIntN(64, 2n**70n+5n)` | `5` | `5` (ok by accident) |
| `typeof (2n ** 70n)` | `bigint` | `bigint` (ok) |

### B. Precision INSIDE i64 range (`bi2.mts`, `bi4.mts`) — a separate, cheaper defect

The i64 arithmetic and the `.toString()` METHOD are exact. What is not
exact is **ToString in a string context**:

| expression | standalone | Node |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `(9007199254740993n).toString()` | `9007199254740993` ✅ | same |
| `(9007199254740993n).toString(16)` | `20000000000001` ✅ | same |
| `String(9007199254740993n)` | `9007199254740992` ❌ | `…993` |
| `"" + 9007199254740993n` | `9007199254740992` ❌ | `…993` |
| `` `${mut}` `` (mut: bigint) | `9007199254740992` ❌ | `…993` |
| `String(9223372036854775807n)` | `9223372036854776000` ❌ | `…807` |
| `String(9007199254740992n + 1n)` | `9007199254740992` ❌ | `…993` |
| `String(idb(9007199254740993n))` (`idb` returns `any`) | `9007199254740993` ✅ | same |

The last row is the tell. An `any`-typed bigint boxes into the `$BigInt`
carrier and takes S62's `__any_to_string` bigint arm, which calls the
**exact** `bigint_toString_radix` formatter
(`src/codegen/bigint-format-native.ts`). A **statically** bigint-typed
operand never gets there: `src/codegen/string-ops.ts` has five
`i64 → f64.convert_i64_s → number_toString` sites that treat a branded
bigint exactly like a native `type i64 = number`.

Ruled out by instrumentation, not by reading: it is **not**
`coerceType` (a probe throw on every `from.bigint` coercion never fired —
`.tmp/s74/probes/bi3.mts`), **not** `boxToAny` (same technique on
`src/codegen/value-tags.ts:211`), and **not** the literal (
`compileBigIntLiteral`, `src/codegen/expressions.ts:1041`, always emits an
exact `i64.const`).

### C. The eight briefed Temporal rows (base, `.tmp/s74/battery/base/Target8-base.tsv`)

All 8 fail. Three distinct signatures:

| row | failure |
| --- | --- |
| `Duration/from/argument-duration-max.js` | `SameValue(«NaN», «9007199254740992»)` |
| `Duration/prototype/add/argument-duration-max.js` | same |
| `Duration/max.js` | same |
| `Duration/from/…-precision-exact-numerical-values.js` | `SameValue(«"[object Object]"», «"PT9007199254740991.975424S"»)` |
| `Duration/prototype/add/…-precision-exact-numerical-values.js` | same |
| `Duration/compare/throws-when-target-zoned-date-time-outside-valid-limits.js` | `Expected a RangeError … no exception` |
| `ZonedDateTime/prototype/add/overflow-adding-months-to-max-year.js` | `Expected a RangeError … no exception` |
| `ZonedDateTime/prototype/add/throw-when-intermediate-datetime-outside-valid-limits.js` | `TypeError: cannot convert number to bigint` |

The two `RangeError`-never-thrown rows are the pure >2^63 limit checks
(S69's attribution).

The slice-1 hypothesis for the `«NaN»` and `«[object Object]»` rows was that
they are **string-round-trip** failures — the polyfill converts its JSBI
carrier with `globalThis.BigInt(t.toString(10))` and reads values back out of
strings, so a rounded `String(bigint)` would corrupt a value that never left
i64 range. **Slice 2 falsified that** (see its log below): those rows do not
move, because the vendored polyfill is untyped JS whose bigints are `any` and
therefore already took the exact dynamic route. `Duration#total("seconds")`
answering `NaN` is the >2^63 wrap — the nanosecond total is ~9.0e24. All eight
rows are on slices 3–5.

## Implementation Plan

### Touchpoint inventory (what the i64 carrier touches)

| touchpoint | file:sym | role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brand constant | `binary-ops.ts:200` `BIGINT_I64` | the ValType itself |
| literal | `expressions.ts:1041` `compileBigIntLiteral` | `i64.const`, exact |
| all arithmetic/compare | `binary-ops.ts:2087-2137` → `compileI64BinaryOp` | ONE choke point |
| `++`/`--` | `expressions/unary-updates.ts:559`, `expressions/host-bigint-updates.ts` | synthesise `1n` |
| assignment / op-assign brand | `expressions/assignment.ts:212`, `expressions/operator-assignment.ts:3340` | re-brand the i64 |
| boxing i64→externref | `type-coercion.ts:3391` (`__box_bigint`) | mints `$BigInt` |
| boxing i64→AnyValue | `value-tags.ts:168,211` | **loses the brand** (boxes as f64) |
| unboxing externref→i64 | `type-coercion.ts:3076` (`__to_bigint`) | §7.1.13 |
| `BigInt(x)` | `registry/imports.ts:999` `__bigint_ctor`, `builtin-ctor-callable.ts:301` | ctor |
| `StringToBigInt` | `runtime/wasmgc/values/string-to-bigint-body.ts` | native parser, i64 |
| ToString (exact) | `bigint-format-native.ts` `bigint_toString{,_radix}` | i64, radix 2..36 |
| ToString routes | `bigint-primitive-to-string.ts` | dynamic receiver + `__any_to_string` |
| ToString (LOSSY, fixed in slice 2) | `string-ops.ts` ×5 | `f64.convert_i64_s` + `number_toString` |
| strict eq on carriers | `extern-eq-fast.ts:135-155`, `any-helpers.ts:832-848` | `struct.get` + `i64.eq` |
| truthiness | `is-truthy-ladder.ts:91` | brand → `"bigint"` |
| `typeof` | `typeof-delete.ts` bigint arms | |
| link boundary | `link-boundary-tostring.ts:154`, `extern-arg-marshal.ts:206` | provider↔consumer |
| `Map`/`Set` keys | `map-runtime.ts:1552-1559`, `collections-es2025.ts:260,732` | |
| wrapper `valueOf` | `wrapper-proto-value-of.ts:385` | `Object(1n)` |

There are 36 `bigint: true` producers and 24 `.bigint` readers across
`src/`.

### Representation (the target, for the >2^63 slices)

Keep the i64 fast path **byte-identical** and add an overflow-promoted
limb form:

```wat
(type $BigIntLimbs (array i32))                     ;; magnitude, little-endian, base 2^32
(type $BigIntBig (struct (field $sign i32) (field $mag (ref $BigIntLimbs))))
```

The **carrier stays `$BigInt`** (one immutable i64 field) for small
values, so every existing `ref.test $BigInt` / `struct.get` site keeps
working unchanged. A promoted value is a `$BigIntBig`; the two are
siblings under a common `$BigIntVal` supertype so `typeof`, truthiness,
`===` and the link boundary test the supertype.

Helpers (all defined funcs, native, no host import):

- `__bigint_is_small(ref $BigIntVal) -> i32`
- `__bigint_small_value(ref $BigIntVal) -> i64`
- `__bigint_promote(i64) -> ref $BigIntBig`
- `__bigint_demote(ref $BigIntBig) -> ref $BigIntVal` (normalises back to
  `$BigInt` whenever the magnitude fits in 63 bits — **canonical form is
  mandatory**, otherwise `===` has two representations for one value)

Operations needing a limb version for Temporal:
`+ - * / % **`, unary `-`, `<` `<=` `>` `>=` `===` `!==`, `ToString`,
`StringToBigInt`, `BigInt(number)`, `Number(bigint)`,
`BigInt.asIntN`/`asUintN`. Bitwise `& | ^ << >>` are **not** on the
Temporal path and are deferred (they stay i64-only, documented).

**Why the ValType does not change.** Stack/local/global/field carriers stay
`{kind:"i64", bigint:true}` for statically-bigint slots, and the overflow
form only ever exists behind the `$BigIntVal` ref. The i64 arms therefore
stay byte-identical for programs whose values fit, which is the acceptance
bar. The cost is that a statically-typed `bigint` local cannot hold a
promoted value — so the arithmetic choke point must **return the ref form**
once any operand or result overflows, which means `resolveWasmType` for
`bigint` has to become the ref carrier in the promoted-capable regime. That
is the real cut line of slice 3 and is the reason slice 2 is landed and
measured first, on its own.

**Link-boundary ABI.** Provider and consumer are compiled by the same
compiler in the same run, so the `$BigIntVal` hierarchy is minted by the
same `addUnionImportsAsNativeFuncs` seeding on both sides and the boundary
`BIGINT` hint (`link-boundary-tostring.ts`, `extern-arg-marshal.ts`) keeps
matching. The limb array type must be minted in the same seeding block as
`$BigInt` so a module that links a provider it did not itself force to mint
the type cannot disagree.

### Landing order

| slice | content | why here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | this plan + probes (docs only) | measured before coding |
| **2** | **exact ToString for statically-typed bigint** — route the six `string-ops.ts` sites to `bigint_toString`, with demand registered in `import-collector.ts`; witness `tests/issue-6656-bigint-tostring-exact.test.ts` | whole-i64-range correctness, no representation change, self-contained, expected to move the string-round-trip Temporal rows |
| 3 | `$BigIntVal` supertype + promote/demote + construction/`typeof`/`===`/ToString on the promoted form | representation |
| 4 | `+ - * / % **` and ordering on limbs | arithmetic |
| 5 | `StringToBigInt` / `Number(bigint)` / `BigInt(number)` / `asIntN` on limbs | conversions |
| 6 | link-boundary survival of a promoted value | provider↔consumer |

Each slice is a pushed commit carrying its own witness and its own
re-measurement of the eight rows in section C.

### Acceptance

- Section B's eight rows all match Node.
- Section C: no row regresses; the string-round-trip rows flip on slice 2
  or are re-attributed with evidence.
- Byte-neutrality for programs with no bigint above 2^63: corpus
  `statusFlips=0 shaFlips=0` vs the S70 base. A module that contains no
  bigint at all must not move a byte in either lane.
- Four-family battery + the nine must-not-move groups: 0 pass→fail vs the
  S70 base.

## Slice log

### Slice 1 (2026-09-20) — plan + probes

Base `bccd46c552`. No `src/` change. Probes and the base TSV for the eight
rows are in `.tmp/s74/` (gitignored); the numbers they produced are
transcribed in sections A–C above.

### Slice 2 (2026-09-20) — exact ToString for a statically-typed bigint

**Landed.** `src/codegen/string-ops.ts` had five sites that stringified a
branded-bigint i64 by `f64.convert_i64_s` + `number_toString`, which rounds
above 2^53: the native-strings operand arm, a template span, a `String.raw`
substitution and both `+` concat operands. Each now prefers the exact
`bigint_toString` formatter when the operand carries the `bigint` brand, the
lane emits native number formatters, and the module demanded the helper.

New leaf `src/codegen/bigint-string-context.ts` owns both halves of that one
decision — `bigIntToStringIdx` (codegen) and `registerBigIntToStringDemand`
(import collector) — so the emitter and the demand can never disagree. The
`usesNativeNumberFormat` gate is load-bearing: in the JS-host lane the demand
would become an `env` IMPORT, and a new import shifts every function index.

**Result: the eight section-C Temporal rows are UNCHANGED — all 8 still fail,
with byte-identical error text (`.tmp/s74/battery/Target8-s2.tsv` vs
`base/Target8-base.tsv`).** The slice-1 hypothesis that they were
string-round-trip failures is therefore **falsified**, and the corroborating
evidence is that the standalone Temporal provider binary is
**3 488 870 B before and after** with the same cache key: the vendored
polyfill is untyped JS, so its bigints are `any`-typed and already took the
exact `__any_to_string` route that #6642 S62 built. Only code whose operand is
**statically** `bigint` — i.e. TypeScript source, not the polyfill — was on
the lossy path. `Duration#total("seconds")` answering `NaN` is the >2^63 wrap
(the nanosecond total is ~9.0e24), not a printing defect.

So slice 2 is a real correctness fix with no Temporal yield, and the eight
rows remain entirely on slices 3–5.

Measured:

- Witness `tests/issue-6656-bigint-tostring-exact.test.ts` — 24 rows. On the
  file-copy revert of the two touched files it FAILS with 17 rounded rows
  (`String(9223372036854775807n)` → `9223372036854776000`, `"" +
  9007199254740993n` → `…992`, `` `${2n ** 62n}` `` → `4611686018427388000`,
  …) while all 5 `ctrl` rows plus `strSmall`/`strZero` already pass, so the
  controls cannot carry the file green. With the fix: 24/24.
- Probes: `bi2.mts` 20/20 exact (was 12 wrong), `bi4.mts` 10/10 (was 7 wrong).
  `bi1.mts`'s remaining 10 wrong rows are all genuine >2^63 wrap and now print
  the wrapped value EXACTLY (`864n * 10n ** 19n` →
  `6923773503929843712`, previously the f64-rounded `6923773503929844000`).
- Corpus 47×{gc,standalone}: `statusFlips=0 shaFlips=0` vs the S70 base.
- `npm run -s test:equivalence:gate`: no new equivalence regressions.
- Gate chain green with the frontmatter allowances above.

### Slice 3 target — measured, and it REORDERS the plan (2026-09-20)

Probing where slice 2's `any`-typed control row actually goes turned up a
defect an order of magnitude larger than the >2^63 range, and it is the one
that owns the eight briefed rows.

**`any`-typed bigint ARITHMETIC does not exist in standalone.** Probe
`.tmp/s74/probes/bi5.mts` — plain untyped helpers (`function mul(a,b){return
a*b}` …) called with bigint arguments, `--target standalone`,
`hostBridge: off`:

| probe | standalone | Node |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mul(6n, 7n)` | `NaN` | `42` |
| `mul(1234567890123456789n, 7n)` | `NaN` | `8641975230864197523` |
| `add(9007199254740992n, 1n)` | `90071992547409921` | `9007199254740993` |
| `sub(…)` / `div(…)` / `mod(…)` | `NaN` | correct |
| `lt(1n, 2n)` | `false` | `true` |
| `neg(9007199254740993n)` | `NaN` | `-9007199254740993` |
| `typeof mul(6n, 7n)` | `number` | `bigint` |
| `eq(x, x)` | `true` ✅ | `true` |

Only `===` is right — that is #6642 S62's `extern-eq-fast` bigint arm, the one
place a bigint carrier is explicitly recognised.

**Root cause.** The `binary-ops.ts` bigint block is entered only when
`isBigIntType(leftTsType) || isBigIntType(rightTsType)` — i.e. on a STATIC
bigint type. An `any`-typed operand never reaches it and falls into the
generic `AnyValue` numeric path, whose tag set is `0 null · 1 undefined ·
2 number · 4 boolean · 5 string · 6 object` — **there is no bigint tag**. The
`$BigInt` carrier boxes as an opaque ref, so `*` reads it as a non-number
(`NaN`), `+` takes the stringy arm (hence the concatenated
`90071992547409921`, which is `"9007199254740992" + "1"`), and `<` compares
two non-numbers.

**Why this owns the briefed rows.** `@js-temporal/polyfill` is untyped JS, so
every bigint it touches is `any`. `Duration.prototype.total("seconds")`
answering `«NaN»` on three of the eight rows is this, not a >2^63 wrap and not
a printing defect — the wrap hypothesis predicted a WRONG NUMBER, and the
observed value is `NaN`. `TypeError: cannot convert number to bigint` on the
eighth row is the same absence seen from the conversion side.

**Consequence for this issue's order.** A limb representation is worthless
until the dynamic path dispatches to bigint at all: arbitrary precision behind
an operator that answers `NaN` changes nothing. So the slice order becomes:

| slice | content |
| --- | --- |
| 3 (was 4) | **dynamic bigint arithmetic** — a bigint arm in the `AnyValue` numeric helpers (`+ - * / % **`, unary `-`, ordering) plus `typeof` and ToNumeric, still on the i64 carrier |
| 4 | `$BigIntVal` supertype + promote/demote (the limb representation) |
| 5 | limb arithmetic / conversions |
| 6 | link-boundary survival |

Slice 3 is the one with measurable Temporal yield and it is **independent of
the representation change**, so it can land on the i64 carrier first. The
open design question it has to answer is whether the bigint carrier gets a
real `AnyValue` TAG (touches `typeof`, `===`, truthiness, ToString, ToNumber
and every arithmetic helper) or whether each numeric helper tests
`ref.test $BigInt` on the existing object tag's `refval` — the second is
narrower and is what `extern-eq-fast.ts` already does for `===`.

#### Slice 3 design (read before starting)

Everything the arm needs already exists; nothing here requires a new type.

- **Detection is free.** `__typeof_bigint(externref) -> i32` is already a
  registered helper (`src/codegen/typeof-delete.ts:2272,2505`; native body in
  standalone), and `ref.test $BigInt` is already used directly by
  `extern-eq-fast.ts:135-155`, `any-helpers.ts:832-848`,
  `collections-es2025.ts:260,732`, `wrapper-proto-value-of.ts:450` and
  `is-truthy-ladder.ts:91`. So "this dynamic value is a bigint" is a
  one-instruction question, not a new mechanism.
- **The value is one `struct.get` away.** `$BigInt` is a one-field immutable
  struct holding the i64, and `bigint_toString` / `compileI64BinaryOp` /
  `__box_bigint` are the exact-i64 formatter, operator and re-boxer.
- **The gap is only the dynamic numeric helpers.** In `any-helpers.ts`:
  `addNumericBinaryHelper` (which generates `__any_sub` and `__any_mul`),
  `__any_div`, `__any_add` (whose "stringy" test currently claims a bigint
  carrier — that is the `90071992547409921` concat), the relational path
  (`emitAnyRelational`) and `__any_to_f64` (`Number(bigint)`). Each needs a
  leading both-operands-are-bigint arm: unwrap to i64, run the i64 op, re-box
  with `__box_bigint`. Every arm is absent-not-wrong — a non-bigint operand
  falls through to the existing tag dispatch untouched.
- **The one real design decision** is whether the re-boxed result gets a new
  `AnyValue` TAG or keeps riding the existing object/extern tag with the
  `$BigInt` ref inside. The current tag set is `0 null · 1 undefined ·
  2 number · 4 boolean · 5 string · 6 object` (`any-helpers.ts`), and a bigint
  currently lands on 5/6 — which is *why* `+` concatenates. Keeping it on the
  extern tag and testing the carrier (the `extern-eq-fast.ts` shape) is the
  narrow option and needs no change to `__any_eq`, truthiness or the boxing
  chokepoints; a real tag is cleaner but touches every tag consumer. Whichever
  is chosen, `__any_typeof` must answer `"bigint"` for the carrier — today it
  cannot, which is the `typeof mul(6n,7n) === "number"` row.
- **Mixed bigint/number must throw a real TypeError**, not coerce (§6.1.6.2.1),
  and `+` with a string operand must still CONCATENATE (§13.15.4) using the
  exact formatter slice 2 just wired up.

Acceptance for slice 3: `.tmp/s74/probes/bi5.mts` 11/11, and a re-measurement
of the eight section-C rows (three of which are `«NaN»` from exactly this).

### Slice 2 validation, completed (2026-09-21)

- **Witness sweep** `tests/issue-66*.test.ts tests/issue-6484-*.test.ts
  tests/issue-6493-*.test.ts`, `--maxWorkers=1`:
  - **Node 25.9.0: 59 files / 368 tests, all green.**
  - Node 22: the same 368 tests pass, but the first run reported 5 red files —
    every one of them `Hook timed out in 10000ms` / `Test timed out in
    35000ms`, never an assertion, on a 4-core box under load ~15 with four
    lanes active. Re-running the five together leaves one
    (`issue-6614-accessor-literal-return-carrier`), and running that one alone
    passes 4/4. So: contention, not regression — recorded rather than silently
    re-run, because "re-run until green" is how a real flake-shaped regression
    gets buried.
- **Battery** (S70 base TSVs, slice-2 provider `.test262-cache/s74-2`,
  `cacheHit=false` on first build): `Duration` 120 rows **matched=120
  passToFail=0 failToPass=0**.
- **Boundaries**: `check:compiler-boundaries:inventory` green with the new
  leaf registered. The `--mode complete` variant fails on
  `prepared-async-frame-adapter.ts`, a pre-existing `bound-unresolved` symbol
  this change does not touch (`inventoryValid: true`).

**Why the remaining battery groups are low-risk.** The change can only fire on
an operand whose STATIC type is `bigint`, which a test262 `.js` body cannot
have; the standalone Temporal provider is byte-identical before and after
(3 488 870 B, same cache key); and the 94-row corpus shows `shaFlips=0`. The
`Duration` group — the one of the thirteen that actually contains bigint rows
— is measured flat above.

### Slice 3 (2026-09-21) — `any`-typed BigInt arithmetic, landed

**Acceptance met: `.tmp/s74b/bi5.mts` 11/11 (base 3/11), host-free standalone,
`hostBridge: "off"` and an empty import object.**

The slice-1 design said the fix was bigint arms in `any-helpers.ts`. That was
**falsified by measurement**: those arms were written, wired in, and moved
none of the eleven rows (3/11 → 3/11), so the module was deleted rather than
shipped unmeasured. Dumping the WAT found the real chain — the failure never
reaches the `$AnyValue` helpers with a bigint in hand, because the value has
already been rounded to an f64 by then.

**Three independent leaks, each measured on its own.** In untyped JS a helper
like `function mul(a, b) { return a * b; }` called with bigints gets
bigint-branded i64 PARAMETER slots from the compiler's own call-site
inference, while TypeScript types both parameters `any` and therefore types
`a * b` as `number`. Every leak follows from that one disagreement:

| # | leak | what it did | where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | the numeric hint | derived from the OPERATOR (numeric ⇒ f64), so each operand loaded through `f64.convert_i64_s` — the existing i64/i64 arm in `compileTypedBinaryDispatch` was unreachable for this shape | `binary-ops.ts` |
| 2 | the result type | `inferNumericReturnTypes` promotes a body that "looks numeric" to an f64 RESULT, converting the exact i64 straight back at the return | `declarations.ts` |
| 3 | `===` and `typeof` | both fold from the STATIC type, so they answered the constants `false` and `"number"` for values that are real BigInts | `binary-ops.ts`, `typeof-static-folds.ts` |

`+` is why leak 1 alone is not enough: `any + any` is `any`, never `number`,
so `a + b` over two bigint parameters never consulted the numeric hint at all
and reached the `$AnyValue` helpers, which box each side with
`__any_box_f64`. Both operands were rounded to doubles and then
**concatenated as strings** before `__any_add` ever ran —
`add(9007199254740992n, 1n)` answered `90071992547409921`.

| probe row | base | branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mul(6n, 7n) === 42n` | `NaN` | ✓ |
| `mul(1234567890123456789n, 7n)` (19 digits) | `NaN` | ✓ |
| `add(9007199254740992n, 1n)` (2^53+1) | `90071992547409921` | ✓ |
| `sub` / `div` / `mod` past 2^53 | `NaN` | ✓ |
| `neg(9007199254740993n)` | `NaN` | ✓ |
| `typeof mul(6n, 7n)` | `"number"` | `"bigint"` |
| `<` / `===` over carriers | already ✓ | ✓ |

**The proof is the BRAND, not the i64 kind.** A bare i64 slot is also how a
native `type i64 = number` annotation lowers, and `/` on two of those is FLOAT
division (§6.1.6.1.5), not `i64.div_s`. The first cut of leak 3 gated the
equality on "the i64 hint produced an i64", which is not evidence — a `number`
operand under an i64 hint is also an i64 — and it made `0n === 0` answer TRUE,
breaking §7.2.15 step 1. `tests/issue-6656-any-bigint-arith.test.ts` carries
that regression as the control `strictEqBigIntVsNumber`: it fails on the
intermediate version and passes on both the base and the fix.

**Two residuals, recorded rather than hidden.**

- `pTypeofVia` — `typeof` of a bigint read back out of a local the kernel's
  result was assigned to, rather than of the call itself. The `typeof` fold
  records kernel FUNCTIONS (`ctx.bigIntKernelFunctions`); it does not
  propagate the brand into an assigned local.
- `bigIntConcat` — `add("v", 12n)` where one untyped `add` is shared by a
  number call site and a bigint one. Monomorphisation gives both call sites
  one signature, so the bigint call arrives already converted. Measured
  IDENTICAL on base and branch and asserted at its base value in the test, so
  a future change to it surfaces there rather than silently.

**Validation.**

- `tests/issue-6656-any-bigint-arith.test.ts` — 10 arithmetic rows with teeth
  (every value past 2^53) plus 7 controls; verified to FAIL on a true
  file-copy revert of the fix.
- 30 bigint/typeof suites, 211 tests: 209 pass. The two failures
  (`issue-1472-es5-getprototypeof`, `issue-3037-cs1c-getprototypeof-carrier`)
  were A/B-checked against a file-copy revert of the whole change-set and
  **fail identically on the base** — pre-existing, not this slice's.
- All five source-ratchet gates green. The dead-export gate earned its keep:
  it caught two `prepareAsyncCallableAbi` call sites that a scripted removal
  of debug tracing had eaten along with the traces.

**The eight briefed Temporal rows do NOT move — 0 of 8, re-measured on this
branch.** `node --import tsx scripts/run-test262-paths.mts --standalone
--isolate`, standalone provider `bee695f13a3f4836` (3 490 363 B), QuickJS eval
provider `073742801ba76347`. All eight fail with the **byte-identical
signatures** recorded in §C on the base: three `SameValue(«NaN»,
«9007199254740992»)`, two `RangeError … no exception`, one `TypeError: cannot
convert number to bigint`, two `SameValue(«"[object Object]"», «"PT900719925…
S"»)`.

This **contradicts the slice-3 plan above**, which called slice 3 "the one
with measurable Temporal yield". It is not. Every one of the eight is a
>2^63 magnitude failure — the nanosecond totals involved are ~9.0e24, four
orders of magnitude past what an i64 holds — so they belong to slices 4–5
(arbitrary precision), exactly where §C's own closing line put them before the
slice-3 target section over-claimed. Slice 3's yield is the `any`-typed
arithmetic correctness itself (11 probe rows, and every untyped bigint helper
in a test262 `.js` body), not these rows. Recorded here so the next lane
does not re-measure them expecting movement.

**Budget.** Extraction into the new leaf `bigint-carrier-operands.ts` (and the
two `typeof` folds into the existing `typeof-static-folds.ts`) took the growth
from +159 lines across four god-files, and +25/+17/+16 on three functions,
down to +27 lines and +1 on one function. What remains is allowed in this
file's frontmatter, with the per-file reason in the comment above.

### Full battery — complete (2026-09-21)

All 13 groups plus `AddSub`, **3 834 rows**, slice-2 provider
(`.test262-cache/s74-2`, `--target both`, `cacheHit=false` on first build),
against the S70 base TSVs:

| group | rows | pass→fail | fail→pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Duration | 120 | 0 | 0 |
| ZonedDateTime | 120 | 0 | 0 |
| PlainDate | 120 | 0 | 0 |
| PlainDateTime | 120 | 0 | 0 |
| AddSub | 150 | 0 | 0 |
| F-class | 250 | 0 | 0 |
| F-methoddef | 100 | 0 | 0 |
| F-objproto | 150 | 0 | 0 |
| E-linked | 300 | 0 | 0 |
| E-unlinked | 300 | 0 | 0 |
| B | 205 | 0 | 0 |
| C | 349 | 0 | 0 |
| D | 300 | 0 | 0 |
| A | 1250 | 0 | **1** |

**0 pass→fail across all 3 834 rows.** The single fail→pass is
`test/language/expressions/object/fn-name-class.js` (`name should be an own
property`), a class-expression name-inference row that this change cannot
reach. Its cause is the comparison base, not the fix: the base TSVs were taken
on S70's tree while this branch is off `bccd46c552`, so `main`'s own progress
in between shows up as a `+1`. Reported rather than dropped, because a
comparison against a base that is not your own base is exactly where an
unexplained flip belongs in the record.

The run was OOM-killed once after `F-methoddef` (exit 137 on a 16 GB box with
four lanes active) and resumed cleanly — `run-batch.mts` skips any pair whose
out-file exists — with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=3072`. That bound is
worth keeping for the next lane.

### Slice 4 probe (2026-09-23) — the NaN / "[object Object]" rows are NOT a limb problem

Before building `$BigIntVal`, the five non-`RangeError` rows in section C were
traced into the polyfill. Result: **native limbs would not move them.**

- The vendored `@js-temporal/polyfill` does all of its large arithmetic in
  **JSBI** (`class JSBI extends Array`, 30-bit digits, pure JS). Native BigInt
  appears only at the API edge (`globalThis.BigInt(t.toString(10))`).
- Compiled standalone, JSBI's **arithmetic is correct**: `.tmp/s74c/jsbi.mts`
  gets `toNumber(9007199254740991 * 1e9 + 999999999)`, the quotient and the
  comparison right. Only its **ToString** fails: `x.toString(10)` is right,
  `x.toString()` answers `"null"`.
- Minimal repro (`.tmp/s74c/tostr5.mts`, `.tmp/s74c/shape.mts`):
  ```js
  class J extends Array { constructor(n, s) { super(n); this.sign = s; } toString(i = 10) { return "G" + i; } }
  const x = J.make(5);   // any-typed: make() can return its argument
  x.toString()           // "null"   (spec "G10")
  x.toString(undefined)  // "G10"
  x instanceof J         // false
  J.prototype.toString.call(x)  // traps: null dereference
  ```
  A standalone `class X extends Array` instance is a plain `$Vec` with its own
  fields in the expando bag. It carries **no link to `X`**, so any dispatch
  that is not statically resolved to `X` (an `any` receiver, implicit
  ToString, `instanceof`, `X.prototype.m.call`) misses the subclass. A
  zero-argument `.toString()` on `any` goes to `__extern_toString`, whose vec
  arm runs `Array.prototype.toString`.
- That substrate gap is **#2917 / #3240** (standalone faithful `extends
  <Builtin>`, Array slice), not this issue. The `«NaN»` rows (a JSBI `total`
  read back through ToString/ToNumber) and the `«[object Object]»` rows (a
  JSBI rendered through the generic ToString) both sit on it. The two
  `RangeError` rows and the `cannot convert number to bigint` row remain the
  genuine >2^63 native-BigInt cases.

Landed alongside as groundwork: `String(x)` for a statically bigint-typed `x`
had no i64 arm and returned the raw i64 as a string (`String(123n) === "123"`
false; `String(123n).length` failed validation on main `95b9eee151`). Fixed in
`src/codegen/bigint-string-context.ts::emitI64ToStringCall`, witness
`tests/issue-6656-string-call-bigint.test.ts` (fails on base with the
validation error, passes after).

### Slice 4 (2026-09-23) — `$BigIntWide`: the three >2^63 Temporal rows

Base `aaf6fa3685`. **Landed.** All 8 briefed standalone Temporal rows now pass
(base: 5 pass / 3 fail). I rebuilt the provider into a private cache for this
run, because the shared cache key ignores compiler changes.

**Root causes (line numbers are on base):**

| Row | Wrong operation |
| --- | --- |
| `Duration/compare/throws-when-target-zoned-date-time-outside-valid-limits` | `864n * 10n ** 19n` goes through the i64 lowering (`binary-ops.ts:3464` `compileI64BinaryOp`, `i64.mul` at :3478). It wraps to `6923773503929843712`, which is a valid instant, so no RangeError. |
| `ZonedDateTime/prototype/add/overflow-adding-months-to-max-year` | The first assertion was already correct. The failing half is `-(864n * 10n ** 19n)`, the same wrap. |
| `ZonedDateTime/prototype/add/throw-when-intermediate-datetime-outside-valid-limits` | Two defects. (1) `var nsMinInstant = -nsMaxInstant` negates an externref script global through `coerceType(…, f64)` + `f64.neg` (`expressions/unary.ts:180-184`). That answers the NUMBER `NaN`, and the polyfill then throws "cannot convert number to bigint". (2) Behind it, the same wrap. |

Inside the linked provider, a wide value was also reduced to its low 64 bits
wherever the checker narrowed it. `typeof n === "bigint"` unboxes the
reference slot through `call __to_bigint` (`identifiers.ts:2414`). Then
`n.toString(10)` (`call-receiver-method.ts:2970`) or `String(n)` formats that
i64.

**Representation.** `$BigIntWide <: $BigInt` holds three fields: the low 64
bits, a sign, and `(array (mut i32))` base-2^32 magnitude limbs. `$BigInt`
loses `final`. Every existing `ref.test $BigInt` site keeps accepting a wide
value and reads field 0. Field 0 is exactly the value the i64 lane computed
before this slice, so a site that does not know the wide form degrades to the
old wrapped answer, never to a wrong type.

The form is canonical: a value that fits in i64 is always a plain `$BigInt`.
The i64 fast path is untouched, since no i64 slot or op changed. Both types
are minted in the block that mints `$BigInt`, so a provider and its consumer
stay canonically identical across the link.

**What produces or consumes a wide value** (leaves `bigint-wide.ts` and
`bigint-wide-parse.ts`):
- **Constant folding.** A bigint constant expression is evaluated exactly at
  compile time whenever a step of it leaves i64. That covers literals,
  `+ - * / % ** & | ^ << >>`, unary `- ~`, `BigInt("…")` and
  `BigInt.asIntN/asUintN(<int literal>, <const>)`.
  - A result that fits becomes its exact `i64.const`.
  - A comparison becomes an `i32.const`.
  - A wide result becomes a `$BigIntWide` wherever the context holds a
    reference.
- **Unary `-` on a bigint carrier in a reference slot** is exact both ways
  across ±2^63 (`__bigint_carrier_neg`).
- **ToString.** The narrowed `x.toString(r)`/`String(x)` sites and the dynamic
  `__extern_method_call`/any-ToString arms format the carrier exactly in radix
  2–36.
- **`===`/`==`.** The extern-eq and any-helpers BigInt arms compare sign and
  limbs.
- **`BigInt(x)` into a reference slot** (`__bigint_ctor_carrier`). A runtime
  string past 2^63 is re-scanned into limbs after `__bigint_ctor` has
  validated it, and `BigInt(wide)` returns the value itself. Every error path
  is unchanged.
- **64-bit TypedArray and DataView reads into a reference slot.**
  - `BigUint64Array[i]` and `DataView#getBigUint64` box through
    `__bigint_from_u64`, so v ≥ 2^63 comes back as its unsigned value.
  - `BigInt64Array[i]` now boxes as a BigInt. Its unbranded i64 read used to
    box as a Number; that was a separate bug, present on base too.

**Results:**
- The 8 Temporal rows: 5/3 → **8/0**.
- Witness `tests/issue-6656-bigint-wide-carrier.test.ts`: 25 rows including
  the controls. I measured base on the 19-row version, where it failed 16 and
  passed 3; after the change, all 25 pass.
- `tests/*bigint*` plus `tests/issue-6656*`: the only failures are the same 4
  in `issue-6619-f64-arg-symbol-bigint.test.ts`, on both base and after.
- Standalone test262, `built-ins/BigInt/**` plus every `language/**`
  bigint-named file (225 rows): **115 → 125, 0 regressions**.
  - Gained: `{equals,does-not-equals,strict-equals,strict-does-not-equals,
    less-than,less-than-or-equal,greater-than,greater-than-or-equal}/bigint-and-bigint`,
    `{division,modulus}/bigint-arithmetic`.
- Standalone test262, every other file with `features: [..BigInt..]` outside
  Temporal (1096 rows): 630 pass after. **0 regressions.** I ran base on every
  row that does not pass after, and each of them fails on base too. I did not
  measure gains in this set.
- Ten rows passed on base only by coincidence: both sides of `sameValue`
  wrapped to the same 64 bits.
  - `asIntN/arithmetic`, `asUintN/arithmetic`,
    `constructor-from-{binary,decimal,hex}-string` and
    `constructor-trailing-leading-spaces`.
  - `DataView/…/getBigUint64/return-values{,-custom-offset}`, and
    `bigint-tobiguint64` in both `ctors-bigint/object-arg` and
    `internals/Set/BigInt`.

  Once the literal side became exact, each failed honestly partway through
  this slice. The `BigInt(…)`/`asIntN` folds, `__bigint_ctor_carrier` and the
  unsigned reads are what make them pass for real.

**What remains (this slice does not do):**
- **Runtime arithmetic still wraps.** `+ - * / % **`, shifts and bitwise ops on
  a runtime value lower to i64 ops, and an i64 slot cannot hold a wide value.
  Limb arithmetic on carriers is the next slice: the ops, relational `< >` on
  carriers, and `~` on a carrier.
- **Wide constants in i64 contexts still wrap.** That covers function locals,
  i64 params and results, and kernel-inferred i64 params. Only reference slots
  hold the wide form.
- `BigInt.asIntN/asUintN` with a non-constant argument still reads the low 64
  bits, which is wrong for `bits > 64`. So is `Number(wide)`.
- An unsigned 64-bit read that lands in an i64 slot is still the signed bit
  pattern, e.g. `u64[0] === 2n ** 63n` compared in the i64 lane. So is a
  dynamic read of a `BigUint64Array` through `any`, because both views share
  one i64 vec type and the runtime cannot tell them apart.
- `"" + x` and template-literal ToString of a narrowed carrier still format
  the low 64 bits. Only `x.toString(r)` and `String(x)` were rerouted.
- `$BigInt` is now non-final in every standalone module that mints it. That is
  a type-section byte change with no behavioural effect.
