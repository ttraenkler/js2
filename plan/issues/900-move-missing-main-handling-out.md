# #900 -- Move missing-main handling out of runtime execution

## Problem

The current playground/runtime behavior around missing exported `main()` is too runtime-driven.

We already ran into cases where:

- code with top-level statements but no exported `main()` appeared to do nothing
- the playground had to synthesize a temporary `main()` for execution
- execution semantics became coupled to runtime checks instead of being decided up front

This should be resolved at compile/load time rather than by deferring the decision to runtime behavior.

## Goal

Make the compiler/playground determine execution intent statically:

1. exported `main()` exists → run it
2. no exported `main()`, but top-level statements exist → compile an explicit execution entry intentionally
3. no exported `main()` and no top-level statements → report that there is nothing to run

The runtime should instantiate and call the selected entrypoint, not discover this implicitly during execution.

## Requirements

1. Detect whether a source/module has:
   - exported `main()`
   - top-level executable statements
   - neither
2. Expose that information through the compile result or equivalent compile-time metadata
3. Remove ad hoc runtime fallback behavior for missing `main()`
4. Keep the playground UX clear:
   - run top-level code intentionally when appropriate
   - report “nothing to run” when appropriate
5. Preserve multi-file and benchmark-project behavior

## Acceptance criteria

- missing `main()` is handled as a compile/load-time execution decision, not a runtime surprise
- playground run behavior is deterministic for:
  - exported `main()`
  - top-level-statements-only modules
  - modules with neither
- no unnecessary runtime checks or synthetic execution behavior leak into emitted hot code
