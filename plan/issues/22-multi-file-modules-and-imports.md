# Issue 22: Multi-file Modules and Imports

## Status: done

> Superseded by #28

## Summary
Support `import { foo } from "./bar"` and `export` across multiple source files, enabling modular TypeScript projects.

## Motivation
Any non-trivial project uses multiple files. Currently the compiler takes a single source string. Multi-file support is needed for real-world usage.

## Design

### Approach: Bundle before compilation
Provide a file resolver that concatenates/inlines imports before passing to the compiler. Similar to how bundlers work.

### Alternative: Multi-source compilation
Accept multiple source files in the compiler API. The TypeScript checker already supports multi-file programs — extend `createChecker` to accept `Map<string, string>` and create a virtual file system.

The codegen would then process all source files in dependency order:
1. Collect declarations from all files
2. Compile functions from all files
3. Only export functions marked with `export` in the entry file

### Import resolution
- Relative imports (`./bar`, `../utils`) → resolve to other provided source files
- Bare imports (`lodash`) → out of scope (would need a bundler)
- Re-exports (`export { foo } from "./bar"`) → follow the chain

## Scope
- `src/checker/index.ts`: multi-file program creation
- `src/codegen/index.ts`: process multiple source files
- `src/compiler.ts`: accept file map in compile API
- `src/cli.ts`: resolve imports from filesystem

## Complexity: L

## Out of scope
- npm package resolution
- Dynamic imports (`import()`)
- Circular dependencies (error on detection)

## Acceptance criteria
- `import { helper } from "./utils"` resolves and compiles
- Functions from imported files are available in the main module
- Only entry-file exports appear in WASM exports
- Circular import detection with clear error message
