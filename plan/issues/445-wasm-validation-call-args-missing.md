# #445 -- Wasm validation: call args missing (72 CE)

## Problem

72 tests fail Wasm validation because a `call` instruction does not have enough arguments on the stack for the target function's signature.

This is distinct from #411 (struct.new args) -- this is about regular function calls where the compiler emits fewer arguments than the callee expects. Common causes:
- Optional parameters not filled with default values
- Variadic functions called with fewer args than the Wasm signature requires
- Method calls where `this` argument is missing

## Priority: medium (72 tests)

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] All call sites emit the correct number of arguments
- [ ] Missing optional args are filled with defaults (undefined/0/NaN)
- [ ] CE count for call args missing reduced by at least 70%
