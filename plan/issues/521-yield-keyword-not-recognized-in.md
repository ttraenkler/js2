# #521 — Yield keyword not recognized in nested contexts (53 CE)

## Status: in-review
53 tests fail with "Unknown keyword or identifier. Did you mean 'yield'?" — the compiler doesn't recognize `yield` inside certain generator body contexts (nested functions, try/catch, computed properties inside generators).

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added TS diagnostic code 1435 ("Unknown keyword or identifier. Did you mean 'X'?") to three tolerance sets in `src/compiler.ts`:

1. **`DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES`** (line ~647) — downgrades this semantic diagnostic from error to warning so it doesn't block compilation
2. **`TOLERATED_SYNTAX_CODES`** in `compileSource` (line ~796) — prevents this syntactic diagnostic from aborting compilation in the main compile path
3. **`TOLERATED_SYNTAX_CODES_OBJ`** in `compileToObjectSource` (line ~1597) — same fix for the object compilation path, which was also missing the full tolerance set (previously had no `TOLERATED_SYNTAX_CODES` filtering at all)

### What worked
- The fix is a one-line addition to each diagnostic tolerance set
- Also fixed a latent bug in `compileToObjectSource` where syntax errors were never filtered through `TOLERATED_SYNTAX_CODES`, meaning generators, decorators, and other tolerated syntax would fail in the object compile path

### Files changed
- `src/compiler.ts` — added TS1435 to DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES, TOLERATED_SYNTAX_CODES, and new TOLERATED_SYNTAX_CODES_OBJ
