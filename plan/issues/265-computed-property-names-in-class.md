# Issue #265: Computed property names in class declarations (TypeScript diagnostic)

## Status: done

## Summary
88 tests fail with "A computed property name in a class property declaration must have a simple literal type". TypeScript rejects computed properties in classes unless the key is a literal or unique symbol. For test262/allowJs, this diagnostic should be suppressed and the computed key handled at runtime.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group C

## Complexity: S

## Scope
- Suppress the "computed property name must have simple literal type" diagnostic in allowJs mode
- Generate struct fields for computed properties using runtime key resolution
- Update diagnostic filtering in `src/codegen/index.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Computed property names in class declarations compile in allowJs mode
- At least 50 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Summary

Resolved as part of #242. Diagnostic code TS1166 was added to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` in `src/compiler.ts`.
