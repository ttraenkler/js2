# Issue 101: Test262 — language/statements remaining

## Summary

Add the remaining `language/statements` subcategories to the test262 runner:
`for-of`, `for-in`, `class`, `generators`, and `async-function`. These
correspond to language features already implemented by the compiler.

## Categories to add

| Category | Feature | Status in compiler |
|---|---|---|
| `language/statements/for-of` | for-of loops | ✅ done (#4, #58) |
| `language/statements/for-in` | for-in loops | ✅ done (#9) |
| `language/statements/class` | class declarations | ✅ done (#6, #35–#37) |
| `language/statements/generators` | generator functions | ✅ done (#64) |
| `language/statements/async-function` | async functions | ✅ done (#30) |

## Approach

1. Add each category to `TEST_CATEGORIES` in `tests/test262-runner.ts`
2. Run `pnpm test` and inspect which tests compile vs. skip vs. fail
3. Add skip filters for unsupported patterns (e.g. `for-of` over iterators,
   `for-in` on prototype chains, classes with private fields, `yield*` delegation,
   top-level await)
4. Fix any compiler bugs surfaced by failing tests

## Expected skip filters

- `for-of`: iterators that require Symbol.iterator (generators, strings, Maps)
- `for-in`: inherited properties, prototype chain enumeration
- `class`: private fields (#), static blocks, class decorators
- `generators`: `yield*` delegation, generator return(), throw()
- `async-function`: top-level await, Promise rejection unhandled
