# Issue #303: Runtime failures -- parseInt edge cases

## Status: done

## Summary
1 test failed at compile time (not runtime) in built-ins/parseInt due to the test262 runner's `wrapTest` function incorrectly stripping `assert.sameValue` calls containing `undefined` as a nested argument (e.g., `parseInt("11", undefined)`) rather than as the expected value.

## Category
Sprint 5 / Group B

## Complexity: XS

## Scope
- Analyze the failing parseInt test to identify the specific edge case
- Fix radix-related parsing (radix 0 should be treated as radix 10)
- Handle leading whitespace and sign characters
- Update parseInt import or wrapper

## Acceptance criteria
- The parseInt runtime failure is resolved

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
1. **Analyzed all 55 test262 parseInt tests** -- found that parseInt codegen and runtime handling were already correct for all edge cases (radix 0, radix 1-36, leading whitespace, sign characters, hex prefixes, null/undefined radix, etc.)

2. **Found the actual bug**: The test262 runner's `wrapTest` function had a regex-based `undefined` assert stripper that broke when `undefined` appeared as a nested function argument rather than as the second argument to `assert.sameValue`. Specifically, `assert.sameValue(parseInt("11", undefined), parseInt("11", 10))` was incorrectly stripped, leaving broken syntax.

3. **Fixed**: Replaced the regex-based stripping with a paren-counting `stripUndefinedAssert` function that correctly identifies when `undefined` is the second top-level argument of the assert call.

4. **Added comprehensive test**: `tests/parseint-edge.test.ts` covering radix 0, radix 1 (out-of-range), radix 37, hex prefix, leading whitespace, negative, looped radix 2-36, Number.parseInt, and octal notation.

### Results
- `S15.1.2.2_A3.1_T3.js`: CE -> PASS (the fixed test)
- All other parseInt tests: unchanged (26 PASS, 28 SKIP, 0 FAIL, 0 CE)

### What worked
- The paren-counting approach (matching the style of existing `stripThirdArg` and `removeAssertThrows` functions) is more robust than regex for nested calls.

### What didn't work
- N/A -- the fix was straightforward once the root cause was identified.

### Files changed
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- added `stripUndefinedAssert` function, updated `wrapTest` to use it
- `tests/parseint-edge.test.ts` -- new comprehensive parseInt edge case tests

### Tests now passing
- `test262/test/built-ins/parseInt/S15.1.2.2_A3.1_T3.js` (was compile error)
