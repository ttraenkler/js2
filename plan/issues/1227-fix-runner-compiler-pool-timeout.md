# #1227 — compiler-pool timeout fires at enqueue, not dispatch

## Problem

All 156 `compile_timeout` entries in the test262 baseline are false positives.
`#1207` empirically confirmed: every one of those tests compiles in under 553ms
when run single-threaded; 134 produce valid Wasm, 22 are genuine compile_errors.

Root cause: `scripts/compiler-pool.ts:195` starts the `setTimeout` at **enqueue
time**, before a fork has been assigned. On a saturated 9-fork pool, queued jobs
wait 20–30s before dispatch — the timer fires before the worker even starts.

```typescript
// line 192–224 — CURRENT (buggy)
private enqueue(msg, timeoutMs, label): Promise<any> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const id = this.nextId++;
    const timer = setTimeout(() => { /* fires too early */ }, timeoutMs); // ← BUG

    this.queue.push({ id, msg, resolve: (r) => { clearTimeout(timer); resolve(r); } });
    this.dispatch();
  });
}
```

## Fix

Move the `setTimeout` start from `enqueue()` into `dispatch()`, at the point
where the fork actually receives the job.

### Step 1 — Change the queue item type

Add `timeoutMs` and the raw `label` to the queued item; store the raw `resolve`
(no timer wrapping yet).

```typescript
interface QueueItem {
  id: number;
  msg: Record<string, any>;
  timeoutMs: number;
  label?: string;
  resolve: (r: any) => void;
}
```

### Step 2 — Strip timer from `enqueue()`

```typescript
private enqueue(msg: Record<string, any>, timeoutMs: number, label?: string): Promise<any> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const id = this.nextId++;
    this.queue.push({ id, msg, timeoutMs, label, resolve });
    this.dispatch();
  });
}
```

### Step 3 — Start timer in `dispatch()`

```typescript
private dispatch() {
  while (this.queue.length > 0) {
    const free = this.forks.find((f) => f.ready && !f.busy);
    if (!free) break;

    const job = this.queue.shift()!;
    free.busy = true;

    // Timer starts HERE — only after the fork has accepted the job.
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      console.error(`[pool] TIMEOUT: exceeded ${job.timeoutMs / 1000}s${job.label ? ` [${job.label}]` : ""}, killing worker`);
      this.pending.delete(job.id);
      job.resolve(
        job.msg.execute
          ? ({ status: "compile_timeout", error: `timeout (${job.timeoutMs / 1000}s)`, compileMs: job.timeoutMs } as TestResult)
          : ({ ok: false, error: `compilation timeout (${job.timeoutMs / 1000}s)`, compileMs: job.timeoutMs } as PoolResult),
      );
      const stuck = this.forks.find((w) => w.busy);
      if (stuck) {
        stuck.busy = false;
        stuck.ready = false;
        stuck.proc.kill("SIGKILL");
        this.respawnFork(stuck);
      }
    }, job.timeoutMs);

    this.pending.set(job.id, {
      id: job.id,
      resolve: (r: any) => {
        clearTimeout(timer);
        free.busy = false;   // mark fork free here too, before dispatching next
        job.resolve(r);
        this.dispatch();
      },
    });

    free.proc.send({ id: job.id, ...job.msg });
  }
}
```

**Note**: the existing `dispatch()` has `state.busy = false` + `this.dispatch()` in
the fork `message` handler. That logic must remain (handles non-pool-managed
resolve paths). The `free.busy = false` line above is optional if the message
handler already covers it — verify and avoid double-dispatch.

## Expected impact

- 156 `compile_timeout` entries in baseline → mostly `pass` (134) and `compile_error` (22)
- The persistent 68 compile_timeout "regressions" on every PR CI run disappear
- `net_per_test` on subsequent PRs improves since false CTs stop inflating regression counts
- Test262 pass count rises by ~134 tests after baseline refresh

## Acceptance criteria

1. `scripts/compiler-pool.ts` timer starts in `dispatch()`, not `enqueue()`
2. Local probe confirms 0 of the 156 formerly-fake CTs time out under the fixed pool
3. `npm test -- tests/test262-runner.test.ts` passes (or equivalent pool unit test)
4. No regression in any other pool behavior (cancellation, SIGKILL on genuine timeout,
   respawn after stuck worker)

## Implementation notes

- Keep the existing message-handler `state.busy = false; job.resolve(msg); this.dispatch()`
  logic intact — it correctly handles normal job completion flow
- The `dispatch()` `resolve` wrapper must call `clearTimeout(timer)` before `job.resolve(r)`
  to prevent timer firing after a successful response
- Also see `plan/notes/test262-timeout-clusters.md` Update 2026-05-01 for empirical evidence

## Implementation summary

- `scripts/compiler-pool.ts`:
  - `QueueItem` now carries `timeoutMs` and the `label` so the dispatcher
    can install the timer at the right moment.
  - `enqueue()` no longer creates a `setTimeout` — it just pushes the
    job onto the queue with the raw outer `resolve`.
  - `dispatch()` creates the `setTimeout` immediately after the fork
    has accepted the job. The timer's expiry callback now SIGKILLs
    the *specific* fork that was running this job (`free`) rather than
    `forks.find(w => w.busy)`, which previously could pick a different
    fork under contention.
  - The `pending.set` resolve wrapper clears the timer on the worker's
    response so successful jobs never trigger a stray timeout.
- `tests/issue-1227.test.ts` — two regression tests:
  1. With pool size 1 and a SHORT 4 s timeout: jobs A (slow source) and
     B (tiny source) both succeed even though B sat in the queue while
     A held the only fork. Pre-fix this would fail with B reporting
     `compile_timeout` after queue-wait.
  2. A genuinely too-slow compile (50 ms timeout on a multi-hundred-ms
     blocker source) still produces a `compile_timeout` and the worker
     gets killed and respawned — the kill-on-genuine-timeout flow is
     not regressed.

## Test Results

- `npm test -- tests/issue-1227.test.ts` — 2/2 pass
- `npm test -- tests/issue-990-negative-pipeline.test.ts` — 7/7 pass
  (sanity check that the existing pool flow still works)
- TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` — clean
