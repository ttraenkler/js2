# #415 -- Logical assignment struct resolution failure

## Status: ready

14 tests fail with "Cannot resolve struct type for logical assignment on property". The logical assignment operators (`&&=`, `||=`, `??=`) fail when the left-hand side is a property access on a type the compiler cannot resolve to a struct.

## Root cause

When compiling `obj.prop &&= value`, the compiler needs to resolve `obj` to a struct type to emit the correct `struct.get`/`struct.set` sequence. This resolution fails when:
- `obj` is typed as `any` or `externref`
- `obj` is a function return value with inferred type
- `obj` is a parameter with no type annotation

## Example failures

- `test/language/expressions/logical-assignment/lgcl-and-assignment-operator-no-set.js`
- `test/language/expressions/logical-assignment/lgcl-nullish-assignment-operator-no-set.js`
- `test/language/expressions/logical-assignment/lgcl-or-assignment-operator-no-set.js`

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Logical assignment on externref/any-typed properties compiles via runtime dispatch
- [ ] `obj.prop &&= val` works when obj type is inferred from function return
- [ ] CE count for "Cannot resolve struct type for logical assignment" reduced to 0
