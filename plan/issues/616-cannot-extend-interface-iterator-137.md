# #616 — Cannot extend interface 'Iterator' (137 CE)

## Status: open

137 tests fail with "Cannot extend an interface 'Iterator'. Did you mean 'implements'?" These are Iterator helper method tests (reduce, find, map, etc.) that extend the Iterator protocol.

### Root cause

TypeScript's `Iterator` is declared as an interface. The test262 code tries to `extends Iterator` in a class declaration, which TypeScript rejects (can only extend classes, not interfaces).

### Fix

Either suppress the diagnostic or declare `Iterator` as an abstract class in the lib types so test262 code can extend it.

## Complexity: S
