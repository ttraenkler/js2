# #1060 — ModuleResolver loses the real `.js` body when `@types/*` is installed

## Problem

`ModuleResolver.resolve()` (`src/resolve.ts:130`) delegates to `ts.resolveModuleName` with `moduleResolution: Node10`. When an `@types/<pkg>` package is installed alongside the real package, TypeScript's standard resolver returns the `.d.ts` declaration, not the implementation. `resolveAllImports` (`src/resolve.ts:204`) then walks only the type declarations and the actual `.js` body is never added to the compile set.

Surfaced by #1031 (lodash stress test). Repro:

```
pnpm install --save-dev lodash-es @types/lodash-es
```

```ts
const resolver = new ModuleResolver(rootDir, { allowJs: true });
resolver.resolve("lodash-es/identity.js", containingFile);
// => node_modules/@types/lodash-es/identity.d.ts   (WRONG — should be real .js)
```

The shim `import identity from "lodash-es/identity.js"; export function run(x) { return identity(x); }` compiles to a Wasm module whose `run` function evaporates into a no-op because the `identity` body was never linked in.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] When `@types/<pkg>` resolves a module specifier, `ModuleResolver` ALSO locates and returns the matching implementation file from `node_modules/<pkg>/...` (`.js`, `.mjs`, or `.ts`).
- [ ] `resolveAllImports` loads both the `.d.ts` (for types) and the implementation file (for codegen).
- [ ] The `#1031 lodash Tier 1 stress test > resolveAllImports walks @types/.d.ts declarations only` test flips: `anyRealJs` should become `true`.
- [ ] Multi-file compile can produce a Wasm export that calls `lodash-es/identity` and returns its argument.

## Notes

- Option A: after `ts.resolveModuleName`, if the result path contains `/@types/`, probe `node_modules/<pkg>/<rest>.js` (and `.mjs`) and use that as the "source" file while keeping the `.d.ts` for type-check.
- Option B: teach `analyzeMultiSource` to accept a `(fileName, content, scriptKind)` tuple so `.js` + `.d.ts` pairs can coexist in the file set.
- Interacts with #1061 (`analyzeMultiSource` ignores `allowJs`) — fixing this alone is insufficient without the companion fix.
