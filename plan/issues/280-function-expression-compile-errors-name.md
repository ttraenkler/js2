# Issue #280: Function expression compile errors -- name binding and hoisting

## Status: done
completed: 2026-03-12

## Summary
~101 tests fail in the language/expressions/function category with compile errors. Named function expressions need their name bound in the function body scope. Function expressions with complex parameter patterns or multiple return types also cause errors.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group A

## Complexity: M

## Scope
- Ensure named function expressions bind their name inside the function body
- Handle function expressions with rest parameters
- Support function expressions in computed property positions
- Update function expression compilation in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Named function expressions can reference themselves by name
- Function expressions in various positions compile
- At least 30 compile errors resolved

## Implementation notes

### Changes made (in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`)

1. **Closure registration for assignment expressions**: When a function expression is assigned via `f = function() { ... }` (binary assignment, not just variable declaration), register the closure info in `closureMap` so `f()` calls work. Safety check: only register for non-boxed locals to avoid type mismatches with mutable captures.

2. **Closure call fallback via type index**: When calling `f()` and `f` is not in `closureMap`, fall back to checking if the local variable has a ref type and look up closure info via `closureInfoByTypeIdx`. This handles cases where the closure was assigned indirectly.

3. **Assignment type promotion**: When assigning a function expression to an externref variable, don't pass the externref type hint, letting the closure compile to its native struct ref type. Then update the local's type to match the closure struct ref.

4. **Destructuring parameter support in closures**: Added destructuring parameter initialization for function expression parameters with binding patterns (array and object destructuring). For typed parameters (ref types), extract elements via struct.get/array.get. For untyped parameters (externref/any), allocate locals with TS-inferred types as a fallback.

### Results
- Baseline: 17 compile OK, 99 compile errors (out of 116 non-skipped tests)
- After fix: 71 compile OK, 45 compile errors
- **54 compile errors resolved** (exceeds the 30 target)
- 14 new tests in `tests/issue-280.test.ts`, all passing

### Remaining 45 compile errors (out of scope)
- ~6 TS strict mode errors (arguments/eval/yield/await in module scope)
- ~12 `.name` property access on functions (not supported)
- ~3 `.length` property access on functions (not supported)
- ~15 nested destructuring with defaults or rest patterns
- ~2 generator function calls
- ~7 other (mixed type errors, unsupported patterns)
