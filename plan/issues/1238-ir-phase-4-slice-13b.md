# #1238 — IR Phase 4 Slice 13b: pseudo-ExternClassInfo registration for String + Array

## Problem

#1169p (`arr.length`) landed as a proof-of-concept by extending
`lowerPropertyAccess` directly. The remaining 25+ String/Array prototype
methods need a more general dispatch mechanism — the existing extern-class
path in `lowerMethodCall` already handles `recv.method(args)` against a
registry, but `String` and `Array` aren't extern classes (no
`declare class String { ... }` declaration), so the registry is empty for
them.

This issue creates the infrastructure: synthesise `ExternClassInfo` entries
for `String` and `Array` and populate `ctx.externClasses` with them so
downstream slices (#1232 / #1233) can lower individual methods through the
existing `emitExternCall` path.

**Depends on**: #1169o, #1169p (both done in S47)
**Unblocks**: #1232 (String fixed-signature methods), #1233 (Array per-element methods)

## Implementation notes

- Add a new pass (or extend `collectExternFromDeclareVar` in
  `src/codegen/index.ts`) that registers two synthetic entries:
  - `String`: properties `{length: f64}`, methods `slice/charAt/indexOf/...`
    populated from the legacy `compileStringMethodCall` switch in
    `src/codegen/string-ops.ts:1404+` (each method's signature derived from
    its native-helper signature).
  - `Array`: properties `{length: f64}`, methods `push/pop/indexOf/...`
    populated from the legacy array-method dispatch.
- Method signatures use `[receiver, args...] -> [return]` shape per
  existing `ExternClassInfo` convention. For Array, the receiver type is
  `(ref|ref_null) $vec_*` (parametric); a per-element-type registration
  loop runs once per encountered vec type, since `params[0]` of each
  method must be the concrete vec type for the IR's type checker to match.
- Add the `IrType.string` → `IrType.extern { className: "String" }` and
  vec → `IrType.extern { className: "Array" }` widening in
  `lowerMethodCall` (and `lowerPropertyAccess` for property access) so
  the existing extern dispatch path takes over for these receivers.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `ctx.externClasses.has("String")` and `ctx.externClasses.has("Array")`
   return `true` after the pass runs.
2. `String.length` works through the extern path (matches the existing
   slice-1 string-receiver handling, which can then be deleted).
3. End-to-end tests verifying that a simple `str.slice(1, 3)` and `arr.push(x)`
   in an IR-claimed function claim correctly and produce valid Wasm.
4. No regression: legacy compilation of String/Array method calls continues
   to work (the legacy path is unchanged; the IR claims more functions but
   falls back cleanly when a method isn't yet in the pseudo-extern registry).

## MLIR alignment

The pseudo-ExternClassInfo registry must be keyed via the `TypeMap` produced by
`propagate()`, not by inline `atom.kind === "string"` / `atom.kind === "object"`
checks in the emitter. Concretely:

- `resolveMethodDispatch(node, typeMap)` — looks up the receiver's type in
  `typeMap.get(node.receiver)` and returns the matching `ExternClassInfo | null`.
- The registry itself is a static table (no IR node mutations, no ambient maps);
  only the lookup is TypeMap-keyed.

This ensures a future MLIR optimizer can produce the same `TypeMap` shape and
the dispatch logic is unchanged. **Anti-pattern to avoid**: calling
`atom.fields` or `atom.kind` directly in the emitter path — route through the
TypeMap contract defined in #1231.
