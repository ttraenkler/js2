# Issue 80: JS file compilation via `.d.ts` types and TS inference

## Current status

**Phase 1 complete. Phase 2 complete.**

### Phase 1 (done)
- `allowJs` and `fileName` options added to `CompileOptions`
- `analyzeSource` in `checker/index.ts` handles `.js` files with `allowJs: true`, `checkJs: true`
- Auto-detects JS mode from `.js` fileName extension
- JSDoc-annotated JS compiles correctly (params, returns, all primitive types)
- 5 tests passing

### Phase 2 (done)
- **Auto-detect JS from source content**: When TS parsing fails with syntax errors that indicate
  the source is plain JS (e.g., "Type annotations can only be used in TypeScript files"),
  the compiler automatically retries with `allowJs` mode enabled.
- **Better error messages for JS without types**: When compiling JS files, the compiler checks
  exported function parameters and return types. If any resolve to implicit `any`, it emits
  helpful warnings suggesting specific JSDoc annotations (e.g., `/** @param {number} x */`).
- **Comprehensive tests**: 13 tests covering multiple exported functions, arrays/loops,
  function-calling-function, boolean returns, conditional logic, and warning messages
  for untyped JS parameters.

The harder parts (CommonJS, implicit globals, inference gaps) depend on #79
(gradual typing) for handling `any` types that TS infers.

## Summary

Accept `.js` files as compiler input, deriving types from three sources:
1. Paired `.d.ts` declaration files
2. JSDoc annotations in the JS source
3. TypeScript's built-in type inference on JS files

## Motivation

Most npm packages ship as `.js` + `.d.ts`. Currently we only accept `.ts` files.
Supporting `.js` input with type information from declarations would unlock
compilation of many existing packages without requiring them to be rewritten.

Even packages without `.d.ts` files often have JSDoc annotations or enough
structure for TypeScript's inference to determine types. Supporting all three
sources means maximum compatibility with minimal user effort.

## Design

### Input modes

```typescript
// Mode 1: JS + paired .d.ts
compile({
  files: ["lib.js"],
  declarations: ["lib.d.ts"],  // types come from here
});

// Mode 2: JS with JSDoc (auto-detected)
compile({
  files: ["annotated.js"],     // types from /** @param {number} x */
});

// Mode 3: JS with inference
compile({
  files: ["simple.js"],        // TS infers what it can
  allowJs: true,
});

// Mode 4: Mixed TS + JS project
compile({
  files: ["app.ts"],
  jsFiles: ["vendor/lib.js"],
  declarations: ["vendor/lib.d.ts"],
});
```

### How it works

We already use TypeScript's compiler API (`ts.createProgram`) for parsing and
type checking. TS natively supports:

- **`.js` with `allowJs: true`** — parses JS, infers types
- **`.js` with `checkJs: true`** — also reports type errors in JS
- **JSDoc type annotations** — `@param`, `@returns`, `@type`, `@typedef`
- **`.d.ts` files** — declares types for `.js` files

The compiler change is mostly plumbing:

1. Accept `.js` files in the input
2. Configure the TS program with `allowJs: true`
3. Use the same type checker we already use — it handles JS inference
4. Codegen receives AST + types exactly as it does for `.ts` files

### JSDoc support (free from TS)

TypeScript already reads JSDoc annotations from JS files:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @returns {number}
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

TS infers `(a: number, b: number) => number`. Our codegen sees the same types
as if it were written in TS. No extra work needed — TS does the inference.

### `.d.ts` pairing

```typescript
// lib.d.ts
export function processData(input: number[]): number;
export function formatResult(n: number): string;
```

```javascript
// lib.js
export function processData(input) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (const x of input) sum += x;
  return sum;
}

export function formatResult(n) {
  return n.toString();
}
```

TS merges the `.d.ts` types with the `.js` implementation. Our codegen sees
fully-typed AST nodes.

### Handling inference gaps

When TS can't infer a type, it assigns `any`. With gradual typing (#79),
these become boxed values. Without #79, they're compile errors — the user must
add JSDoc annotations or a `.d.ts` to fill the gaps.

A `--strict-js` flag could require all JS inputs to be fully typed (via `.d.ts`
or JSDoc), rejecting any `any` inference. This ensures JS files compile to the
same quality as TS files.

### npm package compilation flow

```
1. User: compile("my-app.ts", { deps: ["lodash"] })
2. Compiler: find node_modules/lodash/lodash.js + @types/lodash/index.d.ts
3. TS program: parse both, merge types
4. Codegen: compile lodash functions used by my-app.ts
5. Output: single .wasm with everything inlined
```

This requires tree-shaking (only compile functions actually called) to avoid
compiling entire libraries.

### Limitations

- **Dynamic patterns in JS** — `arguments`, `eval`, computed property access,
  prototype mutation. These fail to compile even with type annotations.
- **CommonJS `require()`** — Need to handle `require()` as an import. TS
  already does this with `esModuleInterop`.
- **Implicit globals** — JS files may reference `window`, `process`, etc.
  without declarations. Need host import fallback.
- **Not all `.d.ts` types are compilable** — Complex mapped types, conditional
  types, and template literal types may simplify to `any` at the wasm level.

## Complexity

M — Most of the work is TypeScript program configuration. The actual codegen
doesn't change — it already works on TS's typed AST, which is the same for
JS files with type information. The harder part is handling edge cases:
CommonJS modules, missing types, implicit globals. ~300 lines for core
support, more for npm resolution.

## Dependencies

| Issue | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **#79** | Gradual typing — handles inferred `any` types gracefully |
| **#28** | Multi-file modules — JS files as additional modules |
| **#77** | Object literals — JS uses object literals pervasively |
| **#78** | Standard library — JS code uses builtins freely |
