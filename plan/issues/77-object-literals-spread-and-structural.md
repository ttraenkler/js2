# Issue 77: Object literals, spread, and structural typing

## Summary

Support ad-hoc object literals (`{ a: 1, b: "hi" }`), object spread
(`{ ...obj, extra: true }`), and structural compatibility between objects with
the same shape.

## Motivation

Almost all real TypeScript code constructs objects inline. Currently the compiler
only supports class instances as structured data — you can't write:

```typescript
const config = { host: "localhost", port: 8080 };
const response = { status: 200, body: "ok" };
const merged = { ...defaults, ...overrides };
```

This is the single biggest gap blocking typical TS code from compiling.

## What to support

### Object literals

```typescript
const p = { x: 10, y: 20 };        // infer struct type from literal
const r = { name: "test", ok: true }; // mixed-type fields
```

Compile each unique shape to a WasmGC struct type. The compiler already does
this for classes — object literals are anonymous classes with no methods.

### Object spread

```typescript
const a = { x: 1, y: 2 };
const b = { ...a, z: 3 };           // { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 }
const c = { ...a, x: 99 };          // { x: 99, y: 2 } — override
```

At compile time, compute the merged type and emit a `struct.new` with values
copied from the source(s) plus overrides.

### Interface / type alias compatibility

```typescript
interface Point { x: number; y: number }
function dist(p: Point): number { return Math.sqrt(p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y); }

dist({ x: 3, y: 4 });               // literal satisfying interface
dist(somePoint);                     // variable satisfying interface
```

If a literal or variable has all fields an interface requires (structural match),
it should be compatible. In WasmGC, this requires either:
- **Shared struct supertype** for compatible shapes
- **Compile-time shape unification** — deduplicate struct types with matching
  field layouts

### Shorthand and computed (limited)

```typescript
const x = 10;
const p = { x, y: 20 };             // shorthand
const key = "name" as const;
const o = { [key]: "val" };          // const computed key — resolve at compile time
```

Dynamic computed keys (`{ [expr]: val }` where `expr` is not const) are out of
scope — they require a hashmap representation.

## Design considerations

### Type deduplication

Two object literals `{ a: number, b: string }` at different call sites should
share the same struct type. Use a canonical field-signature key
(sorted field names + types) to deduplicate.

### Optional fields

```typescript
interface Config { host: string; port?: number }
```

Optional fields compile to nullable WasmGC types. `port?: number` becomes
`(field $port (ref null i31))` or similar boxed representation.

### Nested objects

```typescript
const data = { user: { name: "Alice", age: 30 }, active: true };
```

Each nesting level gets its own struct type, recursively.

## Complexity

L — New AST handling for object literal expressions, struct type generation
from inferred shapes, spread semantics, structural compatibility checking.
Touches type resolution, codegen, and the type system. ~600 lines.

## Dependencies

| Issue | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **#6** | Classes — object literals reuse class struct infrastructure |
| **#17** | Destructuring — destructuring of object literals |
| **#65** | Computed property names — const computed keys in literals |
