# #425 — Async/yield keyword parsing edge cases (12 CE)

## Problem

12+ tests fail with parsing errors related to async and yield keywords in edge-case positions. These are cases where the keywords are used as identifiers in non-strict mode or in specific syntactic positions.

## Priority: low (12 tests)

## Complexity: XS

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Identify the specific parsing failures
- [x] Fix parser configuration or pre-processing to handle edge cases
- [x] Reduce this CE pattern to zero

## Implementation Summary

### Root cause
The `renameYieldOutsideGenerators` function in the test262 runner had two issues:
1. It did not detect `*method()` generator method syntax (only `function*`), so when a test used generator methods without `function*`, the early-return path renamed ALL `yield` tokens indiscriminately.
2. It treated the entire generator body as a single region, so `yield` used as an identifier inside nested non-generator functions within generator bodies was not renamed.

Additionally, diagnostic code 1106 ("The left-hand side of a 'for...of' statement may not be 'async'") was not in `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES`, causing 1 async-related CE.

### What was done
1. Rewrote `renameYieldOutsideGenerators` with a nesting-aware approach:
   - Finds all function/function* declarations, `*method()` generator methods, and arrow functions
   - Builds a nesting tree of function ranges (including parameter lists, so default param values are correctly scoped)
   - For each `yield` token, finds the innermost enclosing function and checks if it's a generator
   - Only preserves `yield` as keyword when the innermost function is a generator
2. Added diagnostic code 1106 to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` for the `async` as for-of variable edge case.

### Files changed
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- rewrote `renameYieldOutsideGenerators`
- `src/compiler.ts` -- added 1106 to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES`

### Tests
- All 697 passing equivalence tests still pass (3 pre-existing failures unrelated)
- All 25 generator/async equivalence tests pass
- Test262: yield-as-identifier tests now compile successfully (verified with arrow-function and object/method-definition categories)
