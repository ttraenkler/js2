# #1278 — Update stale lodash-tier1 stress test

## Problem

`tests/stress/lodash-tier1.test.ts` asserts *old broken behavior* that no longer exists.
5/6 tests now fail because the behavior they document has changed:

- **Tests 4, 5** (ModuleResolver @types, resolveAllImports @types): The resolver was fixed
  — it now prefers real `.js` bodies over `@types/.d.ts` declarations. The tests assert
  the broken behavior (`anyTypeDecl: true`, `anyRealJs: false`) which is now inverted.

- **Tests 2, 3** (clamp Wasm validation, add undeclared-ref): Both tests assert that
  `new WebAssembly.Module(result.binary)` throws a specific error. The actual behavior has
  drifted — they no longer throw the same error (either validates now or throws differently).

- **Test 1** (CJS no exports): Also now failing — behavior changed.

## Fix

For each failing test, determine the *current* actual behavior and update the assertion to
match it. Tests documenting progress (fixed gaps) should flip to assert the correct behavior.
Tests documenting remaining gaps (clamp, add) should be updated with the current error message
or marked `.skip` with a comment pointing to the relevant issue (#1275, #1276).

## Acceptance criteria

1. `npm test -- tests/stress/lodash-tier1.test.ts` passes (all 6 tests)
2. Tests 4, 5 assert the fixed resolver behavior (real .js resolved, not @types)
3. Tests 2, 3 either assert new current error or are `.skip`-ped with issue refs
4. No new logic added — test-only change

## Resolution (2026-05-03)

`tests/stress/lodash-tier1.test.ts` was already updated to assert the current
correct behavior — likely as part of the #1277 (CJS module.exports) and #1074
work that landed before this issue was claimed. All 6 tests pass on current
main:

- Test 1 (CommonJS lodash/identity): asserts `identity` + `default` Wasm
  exports (PR #1277 fix)
- Test 2 (ESM lodash-es/identity): asserts `default` + `identity` exports (#1074)
- Test 3 (clamp): asserts validates as Wasm module (instantiation gap noted)
- Test 4 (add): asserts validates (HOF gap #1276 noted)
- Test 5 (ModuleResolver): asserts real `.js` body resolved, not `@types/.d.ts`
- Test 6 (resolveAllImports): asserts `anyRealJs: true, anyTypeDecl: false`

Status retroactively flipped to `done`. No code changes — issue file metadata
cleanup only.
