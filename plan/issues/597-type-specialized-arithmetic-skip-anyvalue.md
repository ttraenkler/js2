# #597 — Type-specialized arithmetic: skip AnyValue for known types

## Status: open

When both operands of a binary operation have known TypeScript types (both `number`, both `string`), the compiler should emit direct Wasm ops without AnyValue boxing:

```typescript
// x: number, y: number → direct f64.add (1 instr)
// x: number, y: unknown → AnyValue dispatch (4-5 calls)
```

Currently some mixed-type paths fall through to AnyValue dispatch even when one side is typed. The coerceType function should short-circuit more aggressively when source types are known.

## Complexity: M
