# #3420 — non-writable Array element write traps `oob` instead of throwing TypeError

## Problem
Under the honest v8 harness, `propertyHelper.js::verifyProperty` and frozen-array
tests exercise writes to non-writable / frozen Array elements. Instead of throwing a
catchable `TypeError` (strict) or silently no-op'ing (sloppy), the compiler emits an
**uncatchable `unreachable`/`oob` trap**:

```
array element access out of bounds [in verifyProperty() ← __module_init]
```

Because the trap is uncatchable, `assert.throws(TypeError, …)` can't catch it and the
test fails; it also drove the merge-group **oob 45→49 (+4)** trap-growth flag on the
oracle-v8 refresh.

Measured (oracle-v8, run 29634290540): 19 tests newly `oob` vs v7 (11 were v7-pass),
in the Object.freeze / Array.prototype non-writable-target family:
- `built-ins/Object/freeze/15.2.3.9-2-c-*.js`
- `built-ins/Array/prototype/{splice,unshift,pop,reverse,slice,map,filter}/…non-writable…`
- `built-ins/Promise/all{,Settled}/resolve-element-function-{length,name}.js`
Plus a larger latent propertyHelper corpus once #3419 (Duplicate identifier) unblocks
compilation.

## Root cause
Array element assignment lowers to a bounds-checked store that traps on a
non-writable / frozen (or length-locked) element rather than consulting the element's
`[[Writable]]`/extensibility slot and taking the spec path (throw TypeError in strict,
no-op in sloppy). Frozen/sealed/non-writable state (from `Object.freeze` /
`defineProperty` with `writable:false`) is not honored on the fast array-element write
path. Related slot machinery: #2744 (extensible/preventExtensions/seal/freeze
queries).

## Implementation Plan
- Locate the array element **store** lowering (`src/codegen/expressions.ts` assignment
  path + `src/codegen/array-methods.ts` for the prototype mutators splice/unshift/pop/
  reverse). On a write to an element whose descriptor is non-writable, or whose array
  is frozen / element index is non-configurable/length-locked:
  - **strict mode** → throw a real `TypeError` (catchable) — reuse the existing
    TypeError-throw helper so `assert.throws(TypeError)` matches (see #3287 patterns).
  - **sloppy mode** → silently ignore the write (no trap), return the RHS.
- Route the frozen/non-writable query through the extensibility-slot machinery
  (#2744) rather than a raw bounds/`unreachable` trap.
- Ensure the prototype mutators (splice/unshift/pop/reverse) that relocate elements
  also honor per-element writability and throw/short-circuit correctly.

### Edge cases
- Genuine out-of-bounds (index ≥ length on a NON-frozen array that should extend) must
  still extend, not throw.
- `length` non-writable (frozen array) → setting `length` throws TypeError.
- Distinguish "index out of allocated capacity" (grow) from "element non-writable"
  (throw/no-op) — today both collapse to oob.

## Verification
- Scoped: the 19 listed tests + `Object/freeze/15.2.3.9-2-c-*` pass; assert.throws
  catches the TypeError.
- Confirms as a real spec-fidelity fix, not oracle skew: these throw catchably rather
  than trapping.
- Zero-regression on ordinary array growth/mutation.

## Notes
Filed per coordinator request as the REAL bug behind the oracle-v8 oob +4 trap flag
(#3335/#3189). The trap growth itself was within #3370's declared ceiling and
promoted via a one-time forced refresh; this issue fixes the underlying gap.
