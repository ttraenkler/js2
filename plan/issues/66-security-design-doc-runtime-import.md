# Issue 66: Security design doc — runtime import hardening

Sub-issues:
- [#67](67.md) — Closed import objects (replace Proxy with compiler manifest)
- [#68](68.md) — DOM containment (scope access to subtree / shadow root)

## Problem

The runtime (`src/runtime.ts`) uses three `Proxy` objects to serve host imports
to wasm modules: `jsApi`, `domApi`, and the `env` Proxy inside `buildImports()`.
These proxies accept **any property name** — they are open-ended dispatchers that
answer "yes" to whatever the wasm module asks for.

This is unnecessary. Wasm externrefs are **opaque** — wasm code cannot inspect
them, walk their prototype chain, or call arbitrary methods on them. The *only*
way wasm interacts with host objects is through import functions we explicitly
provide. That means **we control the entire attack surface** just by choosing
which functions to put in the import object.

Today we give that control away by using a Proxy.

## How the current Proxy is insecure

### The `domApi` Proxy accepts any method name

```ts
// runtime.ts — current code
export const domApi = new Proxy({}, {
  get(_, prop) {
    const name = String(prop);
    const rest = name.slice(name.indexOf("_") + 1);
    // Accepts ANY property name after the prefix:
    if (rest.startsWith("get_")) return (self) => self[rest.slice(4)];
    if (rest.startsWith("set_")) return (self, v) => { self[rest.slice(4)] = v; };
    return (self, ...args) => self[rest](...args);
  }
});
```

A compiled wasm module only imports the methods that were declared in the
TypeScript source (e.g., `Element_get_textContent`). But the Proxy doesn't know
that. It will happily serve `Element_get___proto__` or `Element_get_constructor`
if a wasm binary requests them. This means a hand-crafted `.wasm` file (not
produced by our compiler) could:

1. Get a DOM element via a legitimate `Element_new` import
2. Request `Element_get_constructor` → gets `HTMLElement.constructor`
3. Request `Element_get___proto__` → walks the prototype chain
4. Reach `Function`, `Object`, `window` — full sandbox escape

### The `jsApi` Proxy has `__extern_get`

```ts
if (name === "__extern_get") return (obj, idx) => obj[idx];
```

This is a generic dynamic property accessor. Combined with any externref, it
allows reading **any property by name** — including `__proto__`, `constructor`,
`prototype`. It's the equivalent of giving wasm the `[]` operator on JS objects.

### The `string_*` pattern is unbounded

```ts
if (name.startsWith("string_")) {
  const method = name.slice(7);
  return (s, ...a) => s[method](...a);
}
```

Any import name starting with `string_` calls that method on a string. A
string's prototype chain includes `Object.prototype`, so methods like
`string___defineGetter__` or `string_constructor` are reachable.

## Why this matters

**Today it doesn't** — we compile our own TypeScript and trust the output. The
compiler only generates imports for declared methods. But:

- If we ever compile **untrusted TypeScript**, a user could declare a fake
  `extern class` with methods like `constructor` or `__proto__` to escape
- If someone loads a **hand-crafted wasm binary** with our runtime, they get
  full access
- The Proxy pattern makes it **impossible to audit** what the host exposes —
  the answer is "everything"

## Solution: closed import objects from the compiler manifest

The compiler **already knows every import** at compile time. It even generates
them as a closed object in `generateImportsHelper()` (compiler.ts:419-486).
The runtime just doesn't use this information.

### Step 1: Export the import manifest from `CompileResult`

```ts
export interface CompileResult {
  // ... existing fields ...
  /** List of required env imports with their intent */
  imports: ImportDescriptor[];
}

interface ImportDescriptor {
  module: "env" | "wasm:js-string" | "string_constants";
  name: string;
  kind: "func" | "global";
  /** What this import does — used to generate the implementation */
  intent:
    | { type: "string_literal"; value: string }
    | { type: "math"; method: string }
    | { type: "console_log"; variant: string }
    | { type: "extern_class"; className: string; action: "new" | "method" | "get" | "set"; member?: string }
    | { type: "string_method"; method: string }
    | { type: "builtin"; name: string }
    // ...
}
```

### Step 2: Replace `buildImports()` with a closed builder

```ts
export function buildImports(
  manifest: ImportDescriptor[],
  deps?: Record<string, any>,
): WebAssembly.Imports {
  const env: Record<string, Function> = {};

  for (const imp of manifest) {
    if (imp.module !== "env") continue;
    env[imp.name] = resolveImport(imp.intent, deps);
  }

  return { env, "wasm:js-string": jsString };
}
```

`resolveImport` is a closed switch (not a Proxy) that returns a function for
each known intent type. Extern class methods call only the specific method that
was declared — not an arbitrary property name from the import string.

### Step 3: Remove all three Proxies

- `jsApi` Proxy → gone, functions generated per-import
- `domApi` Proxy → gone, functions generated per-import
- `buildImports` inner Proxy → gone, plain object

### Step 4: Restrict `__extern_get`

Either:
- **Remove it entirely** — replace with specific property access imports that
  the compiler generates per-property
- **Allowlist mode** — the compiler emits which property names are accessed,
  `__extern_get` checks against that list at runtime

## What stays the same

- The wasm binary format doesn't change
- `generateImportsHelper()` (standalone JS wrapper) already works this way
- `wasm:js-string` polyfill stays as-is (it's already a closed object)
- `instantiateWasm()` with native builtins fallback stays as-is

## Security properties after this change

| Property | Before (Proxy) | After (closed) |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Can wasm request arbitrary methods? | Yes | No — only manifest entries |
| Can wasm access `__proto__`? | Yes via `__extern_get` or `domApi` | No |
| Can wasm walk prototype chain? | Yes | No |
| Can hand-crafted wasm escape sandbox? | Yes | No — unrecognized imports fail linking |
| Auditable surface area? | No — Proxy is open-ended | Yes — `manifest` lists every import |

## Migration

The `compileAndInstantiate()` convenience function keeps working — it just
uses the new `result.imports` manifest internally. External users who call
`buildImports()` directly pass the manifest instead of `stringPool`.

## Complexity

M — ~300 lines across 3 files (compiler.ts, runtime.ts, index.ts)

## SES/Endo threat model checklist

SES (Secure ECMAScript) by Agoric defines the most comprehensive threat model
for JavaScript sandboxing. Here's how our closed-import approach addresses each
attack vector, and what remains out of scope:

| Attack vector | SES mitigation | ts2wasm (after this issue) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prototype pollution** | Freeze all intrinsics | Not needed — wasm can't touch prototypes | Wasm has no `__proto__`, no `Object.prototype`. Externrefs are opaque. |
| **Global object access** | Compartment with bare `globalThis` | Not needed — wasm has no globals concept | Wasm modules have zero JS scope. No `window`, no `globalThis`. |
| **Ambient authority** (fetch, localStorage...) | Only what you endow | Only what the manifest declares | Closed import object = explicit capability list. Same principle. |
| **Property descriptor manipulation** | Frozen intrinsics | Import functions are plain closures | No `Object.defineProperty` possible from wasm. |
| **Coercion attacks** (valueOf, toString, Symbol.toPrimitive) | Defensive coding at trust boundaries | Not applicable | Wasm values are i32/f64/externref. No implicit coercion. |
| **eval / Function constructor** | Replaced with compartment-scoped versions | Not applicable | Wasm cannot eval. No code generation at runtime. |
| **Dynamic import()** | Controlled by compartment's importHook | Not applicable | Wasm has no dynamic import mechanism. |
| **Timing side-channels** | Disable Date.now, Math.random | Only if manifest excludes Date/Math | Compiler controls which Math/Date functions are importable. |
| **Proxy-based reentrancy** | Defensive coding | Not applicable | Wasm calls are synchronous, no trap handlers. |
| **Resource exhaustion / DoS** | Not addressed by SES | Not addressed | Wasm fuel metering could help (future work). |

**Key insight**: Wasm GC modules are inherently more restricted than JS code.
Most of SES's threat model doesn't apply because wasm can't manipulate
prototypes, define properties, eval code, or access globals. The one attack
vector that *does* apply — ambient authority via imports — is exactly what this
issue fixes.

### What we should still check

1. **Returned externrefs must not leak capabilities**: If an import returns
   `window` or `document` as an externref, and the module has `__extern_get`,
   it can walk properties. Fix: remove `__extern_get` or restrict it (Step 4).

2. **String method proxy**: Even with closed imports, `string_replace` still
   calls `s.replace(...)` which could trigger Symbol.replace on a non-string
   argument. Fix: the closed import should type-check: `(s: string, ...) =>
   String(s).replace(...)`.

3. **Extern class method dispatch**: The generated import for
   `Element_get_textContent` does `(self) => self.textContent`. If `self` is
   not the expected type (e.g., someone passes a Proxy), the property access
   could trigger traps. Fix: consider `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor`-based
   access for sensitive properties, or just document that the host controls
   what externrefs are passed in.

### Zena: the closest comparison

[Zena](https://github.com/elematic/zena) is the most architecturally similar
project — a Wasm GC-first language with TypeScript-like syntax. Key differences:

- **Sound type system**: Zena has no `any`, no escape hatches, nominal classes.
  ts2wasm compiles real TypeScript with its unsound structural type system.
- **No runtime reflection**: Zena has no dynamic property access, no object-as-map.
  This eliminates `__extern_get` entirely by language design. ts2wasm needs to
  handle TS's dynamic patterns (bracket access, `any` types) at the import boundary.
- **Explicit `@external` imports**: Zena uses `@external("module", "name")`
  decorators on `declare` functions. The host surface is visible in source code.
  Same idea as our import manifest, but enforced at the language level rather
  than the runtime level.
- **No DOM story yet**: Zena is positioned as "TypeScript-like alternative to
  Rust for wasm/WASI". No extern class pattern for DOM. ts2wasm's extern class
  model with typed DOM access is a differentiator.
- **Smaller binaries**: Zena optimizes aggressively for wasm GC — 37 bytes for
  a minimal program, unboxed primitives, monomorphized generics. ts2wasm
  prioritizes compatibility with real TS over binary size.

The security takeaway: Zena gets import-surface security "for free" by being a
new language with no dynamic features. ts2wasm needs to *enforce* it at the
runtime boundary because TypeScript has dynamic features that compile to
dynamic imports (`__extern_get`, `string_*` patterns). This issue closes that gap.

### Why ts2wasm's approach is interesting

Most sandboxing approaches fall into two camps:

1. **Process/thread isolation** (Workers, iframes): Strong isolation, but
   no DOM access from the sandbox (Workers) or heavy resource cost (iframes).
   Both give the sandboxed code a full JS environment with ambient authority.

2. **Interpreter-in-wasm** (QuickJS, Javy): Strong isolation via double
   sandboxing, but 50-200x performance penalty and 500KB+ bundle size.
   No DOM access.

ts2wasm is in a unique position:

- **Real TypeScript** compiled to Wasm GC — not a different language
  (unlike AssemblyScript), not an interpreter (unlike QuickJS)
- **Typed DOM access** via extern classes — the compiler knows exactly which
  DOM methods the code uses, and the manifest lists them explicitly
- **Near-native performance** for compute, with boundary overhead only for
  host calls
- **Tiny bundle** — the wasm binary is the only payload, typically 1-30 KB
- **Auditable surface** — the import manifest is a complete, inspectable
  list of every capability the module needs

The combination of "real TypeScript + DOM access + auditable capability list"
is unique. SES can also do DOM access but requires extreme care to avoid
leaking references. Iframes can do DOM access but only in their own isolated
document. ts2wasm can do DOM access in the *host's* document, scoped to
exactly the declared API surface.

### DOM containment: scoping to a subtree or shadow root

Beyond this issue, a natural extension is **DOM containment**: restricting
a wasm module's DOM access to a specific subtree or shadow root.

The mechanism is straightforward since we control the import functions:

```ts
// Instead of:
Element_querySelector: (self, sel) => self.querySelector(sel)

// Generate:
Element_querySelector: (self, sel) => {
  if (!container.contains(self)) throw new Error("DOM access out of bounds");
  return self.querySelector(sel);
}

// Or even better — scope the root:
document_querySelector: (sel) => container.querySelector(sel)
```

Since the compiler knows every DOM method in the manifest, we can:
1. Replace `document` references with a container element or shadow root
2. Add containment checks to methods that traverse the DOM
3. Block methods that escape containment (`document.body`, `parentElement`
   beyond the root, `window` access)

This is a separate issue but builds naturally on the closed-import architecture.

## Out of scope

- CSP / iframe sandboxing (orthogonal)
- Wasm memory isolation (not applicable — we use GC, no linear memory)
- Signing or verifying wasm binaries
- DOM containment (separate issue, builds on this one)
- Wasm fuel metering for DoS prevention (separate issue)
