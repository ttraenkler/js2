# #533 — Wasm validation: struct.get on null ref type (125 CE)

## Status: in-progress

125 tests fail Wasm validation with "struct.get[0] expected type (ref null N), found ref.null of type externref" -- the compiler emits struct.get on externref null because object literal method parameters with binding patterns (ArrayBindingPattern, ObjectBindingPattern) were not being destructured.

## Root Cause

Object literal methods in `compileObjectLiteralForStruct` (expressions.ts ~16550) name binding-pattern params as `__param0` but never emit destructuring code to extract individual bindings into locals. When the method body references the destructured bindings (e.g. `x.length` from `method([...x])`), the compiler cannot find them in the local map and falls back to emitting `ref.null.extern`, which fails Wasm validation when used with `struct.get`.

## Fix

Added parameter destructuring for object literal methods by calling `destructureParamObject`/`destructureParamArray` after `emitMethodParamDefaults`. These functions were already implemented in `index.ts` for class methods and standalone functions but were not exported or used for object literal methods.

## Complexity: S
