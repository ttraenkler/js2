# #1073 — Scope injection for `__extern_eval`: preserve caller-visible identifiers

## Context

#1006 (PR #102, commit 2e195d09) routed `eval(...)` through a new
`__extern_eval` JS-host import. That's the correct narrow first step:
JS-host-only mode gets real eval semantics, standalone mode traps on
instantiation. However, the implementation evaluates the string via
`(0, eval)(src)`, which runs in JS global scope with **no visibility**
into any identifier defined by the enclosing wasm-compiled code.

On its own that doesn't matter for pure-JS eval snippets. But the
test262 harness in `tests/test262-runner.ts::wrapTest` does a blanket
text-rewrite of assertion helpers across the whole source — including
inside string literals passed to `eval()`. After the rewrite, an
annexB eval-code test contains this in its compiled form:

```ts
eval(
  'assert_throws(function() { f; });' +
  'assert_sameValue(typeof f, "undefined");' +
  '...'
);
```

The identifiers `assert_throws`, `assert_sameValue`, `__assert_count`,
`__fail`, `fnGlobalObject`, `isSameValue`, `verifyProperty` are all
wasm-compiled functions/vars in the outer `test()` function. The
JS-host `(0, eval)` call has no way to see them, so every eval'd
assertion raises `ReferenceError: assert_throws is not defined` (or
similar) and the test crashes.

## Quantitative impact

Regression diff on PR #102 branch vs current main baseline (2026-04-11):

| Sub-bucket | Count | Error pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Harness visibility | 107 | `assert_throws/assert_sameValue/__assert_count/fnGlobalObject is not defined` |
| Invalid eval body | 48 | `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'as'` (export/namespace syntax the JS parser rejects) |
| Indirect-eval wiring | 24 | `(0 , eval) is not a function` |
| **Total in annexB/language/eval-code** | **179** | |

Plus ~44 tests in the same directory that **improved** under PR #102
(simple `eval("var x = 1")` + enclosing `assert_sameValue(x, 1)` — the
wasm-scope assertion works because `x` is now real). Net: directory is
−135 under a naive implementation.

As a temporary mitigation in PR #102, `shouldSkip` was extended to skip
the entire `annexB/language/eval-code` directory (commit 4a4a0182),
restoring the regression ratio to ~3%. This issue tracks the proper fix
that unskips the directory and converts 179 regressions → ~155
additional improvements.

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§19.2.1.1 PerformEval](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-performeval) — step 4: eval code is parsed in the context of the calling function's LexicalEnvironment and VariableEnvironment
- [§9.1.2.1 GetIdentifierReference](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-getidentifierreference) — identifier resolution walks the lexical environment chain, which eval inherits from its caller


## Root cause

Three orthogonal gaps:

### Gap 1: harness visibility (107 tests)

`wrapTest` compiles harness helpers as **local TypeScript functions
inside the exported `test()` function**. They become wasm-scope
identifiers with no JS-side counterpart. The eval source string
containing `assert_throws(...)` cannot reach them.

### Gap 2: invalid eval bodies (48 tests)

48 tests eval source strings containing ES module syntax (`export * as
...`, `export { ... } from ...`). JavaScript's `eval` rejects these as
syntax errors — they are Module-Goal constructs, not Script-Goal.
Examples: `test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/func-switch-dflt-eval-func-skip-early-err-switch.js`.

These are arguably **un-fixable** through JS host eval — even a
perfectly scoped injection can't make `eval("export * as foo ...")`
succeed in a Script context. They need either a skip filter or
self-hosted eval that calls back into js2wasm's compiler.

### Gap 3: indirect-eval wiring (24 tests)

24 tests have source that, inside their eval'd string, references
`(0, eval)` or stores `eval` to a variable and calls it indirectly.
The current implementation routes both `eval(x)` and `(0, eval)(x)`
to `__extern_eval` via codegen intercept in `compileCallExpression`.
But when the user code *inside* an eval'd string does
`var e = (0, eval); e("...")`, the runtime evaluates `(0, eval)` on
the JS side. In JS-host eval scope, `eval` is the JS built-in, not
our wasm import — so the indirection works but the call-site
afterwards doesn't follow through properly. Needs investigation of
why the returned function is "not a function" per the error message.

## Design options

### Option A: JS-side harness shim (cheapest, rescues ~107)

In `src/runtime.ts::__extern_eval`, prepend a JS-side definition of
the test262 harness helpers to the source before evaluating. Each
shim mirrors the wasm-compiled logic (`__fail` counter, early-exit
on first failure) using a local JS closure.

```ts
if (name === "__extern_eval")
  return (src: any) => {
    if (typeof src !== "string") return src;
    const shim = `
      var __fail = 0, __assert_count = 1;
      function assert_throws(fn) { __assert_count++; try { fn(); } catch { return; } if (!__fail) __fail = __assert_count; }
      function assert_sameValue(a, b) { __assert_count++; if (a !== b && !(a !== a && b !== b)) { if (!__fail) __fail = __assert_count; } }
      // ... rest of harness ...
    `;
    const wrapped = shim + ";(function(){" + src + "})();"
      + ";if (__fail) throw new Error('harness assertion ' + __fail + ' failed');";
    return (0, eval)(wrapped);
  };
```

**Pros:** local change, no codegen impact, unlocks 107 tests.
**Cons:** doesn't share state with outer wasm `__fail`, so if an eval
sub-assertion fails the outer test still needs to observe via thrown
exception. Doesn't address Gap 2 or Gap 3.

### Option B: Expose wasm harness as module exports, pass via globalThis

Make the test262 wrapper `export` the harness helpers from the wasm
module. `buildImports` can then pull them out via `callbackState.getExports()`
and install on globalThis before eval runs. Eval'd code finds
`globalThis.assert_throws` — works, and state is shared with the
outer test.

**Pros:** correct state sharing; harness only defined once.
**Cons:** requires wrapTest to mark helpers as exported, runtime to
install/uninstall globalThis properties around each eval call (risk
of leakage between tests), and the identifier set is fixed at
compile time.

### Option C: Self-hosted eval — recursive js2wasm compile

`__extern_eval` runs the source through `compile()` itself and
instantiates a new module that imports the caller's harness exports.
Strict, correct, matches ES semantics.

**Pros:** handles Gaps 1 and (partially) 2 — still can't run module
syntax but can run any valid Script body.
**Cons:** by far the largest change — compiler reentrancy, module
composition, per-call compilation cost. Likely a multi-sprint effort.

### Recommendation

Ship Option **A** now as a first pass, combined with the existing skip
filter for the 48 export-syntax tests (Gap 2). Defer Option C as a
longer-term design goal under a separate ticket. Investigate Gap 3
separately — it may turn out to be fixable by a small change in how
the indirect-eval intercept coerces the returned externref.

Projected impact of Option A alone: +107 tests pass (annexB eval-code
harness-visibility sub-bucket).

## Files to touch

- `src/runtime.ts` — `__extern_eval` handler (see Option A code sample)
- `tests/test262-runner.ts::shouldSkip` — narrow the existing annexB
  eval-code skip filter to only skip tests whose eval'd string
  contains `export ` or `(0, eval)` (the Gap 2 and Gap 3 subsets),
  unskipping the Gap 1 tests.
- `tests/issue-1073.test.ts` — direct, indirect, harness-visible,
  state-shared cases.

## Acceptance criteria

1. After fix, at least **90 of the 107 harness-visibility regressions**
   in `annexB/language/eval-code` convert to pass.
2. No new regressions outside `annexB/language/eval-code` vs current
   main baseline.
3. Tests cases covering: direct eval with `assert_throws` inside,
   indirect eval `(0, eval)(...)` with harness inside, nested eval
   (eval inside eval), error propagation from eval'd assertion
   failure.
4. Wider test262 scope: no regressions in `test/language/eval-code`
   (non-annexB) from the shim prepending mechanism.

## Source

Filed by `dev-1053` as follow-up to PR #102 (#1006) triage. Team-lead
directed the hold on PR #102 pending this fix — PR #102 stays open as
draft and references this ticket in its body.

## Known gap

Gap 3 (`(0, eval) is not a function` — 24 tests) is not directly
addressed by Option A; it needs separate root-cause investigation in
`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts::isEvalCallExpression` or the
`__extern_call` path that handles callable externrefs. Track as a
sub-task of this issue or spawn a #1074 if scope grows.

## Test Results

### annexB/language/eval-code batch test (471 tests, was 0/471 — all skipped)
- **Pass: 230**, Fail: 128, Runtime Error: 113, Skip: 0
- Error breakdown:
  - 128x FAIL(2) — wasm/JS scope gap for variables (eval can't modify wasm locals)
  - 64x eval harness assertion fires — correct Annex B hoisting semantics differ
  - 49x WebAssembly.Exception — wasm throws propagate correctly

### language/eval-code (non-annexB, regression check)
- Pass: 114, Fail: 23, CE: 137, RuntimeErr: 83, Skip: 3
- No new regressions vs baseline (these numbers match pre-fix state)

### Issue-specific tests (tests/issue-1073.test.ts)
- 6/6 pass: assert_sameValue in eval, assert failure throws, assert_throws in eval,
  non-harness eval, TS annotation stripping, nested eval

### Deep analysis of remaining 241 failures (all in direct/)
- **128x FAIL(returned 2)**: First outer-scope assertion fails — eval can't modify
  wasm-scope variables. Fundamental wasm/JS scope boundary, needs Option B/C.
- **64x eval harness assertion failed**: Shim assertions fire correctly but Annex B
  hoisting semantics differ between JS eval and spec expectations.
- **49x WebAssembly.Exception**: Wasm throws propagating — outer assertions fail.
- All 164 indirect/ tests pass. No actionable single-fix cluster remains.

## Implementation

Modified `src/runtime.ts::__extern_eval` handler (Option A — JS-side harness shim):
1. Strip TypeScript annotations (`as number`, `as any`) that wrapTest leaks into eval strings
2. Detect harness identifiers in eval'd source (assert_sameValue, assert_throws, etc.)
3. When detected, prepend JS-side shim definitions that mirror wasm-compiled preamble
4. If any shim assertion fails, throw Test262Error to propagate to outer wasm try/catch

Removed blanket `annexB/language/eval-code/` skip filter in `tests/test262-runner.ts`.
Gap 2 (export syntax) and Gap 3 (indirect eval wiring) tests fail naturally.

## Harvest note — 2026-08-11 (residual, `status: done` but not resolved)

Source: `test262-current.jsonl` from `loopdive/js2wasm-baselines`, run
`20260811-103533` (gitHash `9268d5a5`).

`annexB/language/eval-code` still carries **184 official failures** with the
same root-cause shape this issue was opened for — harness identifiers not
visible inside the eval'd string:

| Signature | Count | Directory |
|---|---|---|
| `assert is not defined` | 120 | `annexB/language/eval-code` (all) |
| `null is not a function [in __module_init()]` | 64 | `annexB/language/eval-code` |

The original scoping table recorded **179** failures in this same directory
("Harness visibility 107 / invalid eval body 48 / indirect-eval wiring 24").
The count has **not gone down** — it is now 184.

What did change is the identifier: the fix targeted the rewritten names
(`assert_throws`, `assert_sameValue`, `__assert_count`, `fnGlobalObject`), and
the failing tests now report the **un-rewritten** `assert`. That is consistent
with the harness text-rewrite having changed since this fix landed, leaving the
JS-side shim list matching names the harness no longer emits.

Samples:

- `test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/func-if-stmt-else-decl-eval-func-skip-early-err-block.js`
- `test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/global-switch-case-eval-global-skip-early-err-try.js`
- `test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/global-block-decl-eval-global-existing-block-fn-no-init.js`

**Action:** re-open, or file a successor that re-derives the shim list from the
harness rewrite rather than hard-coding names. Left as `done` pending a
maintainer call — flagged here so it is not invisible.
