# #172 — Array.isArray edge case

## Problem
`assert.sameValue(Array.isArray(x), true/false)` failed to compile because `assert_sameValue` expected `number` but `Array.isArray` returns `boolean` (i32). The boolean assert routing fix in #171 resolves this.

Remaining compile errors in `Array/isArray` are due to other unrelated limitations:
- `Array.isArray` as a property reference (not call) — needs first-class function references
- `new Array()` constructor form
- Missing identifiers (`Math`, `JSON` as values)

## Fix
The boolean assert routing added in #171 (`assert_sameValue_bool`) allows Array.isArray tests that use `true`/`false` comparisons to compile and pass correctly.

## Tests unblocked
Array.isArray: 9 pass, 0 fail, 8 compile_error (unchanged — the 8 CEs are due to other features, not Array.isArray itself)

## Status: Done
## Complexity: XS
