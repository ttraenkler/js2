# #441 -- RuntimeError: dereferencing a null pointer -- residual after #419 (88 fail)

## Problem

88 tests fail at runtime with "RuntimeError: dereferencing a null pointer". Issue #419 (done) addressed null pointer dereferences in destructuring patterns, reducing the count from 116. The remaining 88 failures occur in other codegen paths.

## Root cause analysis

The failures fall into two categories:

1. **Wasm stack imbalance in rest element codegen (statements.ts)**: The `select`-based clamping of `restLen = max(0, len - i)` computed `len - i` THREE times but only consumed two via `select`, leaving one extra i32 on the stack. This produced a CompileError ("expected 0 elements on the stack for fallthru, found 1"), not a null deref. Affected: variable destructuring (`const [...x] = arr`).

2. **Missing rest element implementation in param destructuring (index.ts)**: `destructureParamArray` had a TODO for rest elements -- it allocated a local but never populated it, leaving it as null. When the rest variable was accessed later, it crashed with null pointer deref. Affected: function param destructuring (`function([...x])`).

Both patterns affect tests named `ary-ptrn-rest-id`, `ary-ptrn-rest-ary-rest`, etc. -- 108+ of the 118 null-pointer failures in test262.

## Fixes applied

1. Fixed stack imbalance by computing `len - i` once, storing in `restLenLocal`, then using `select(0, restLenLocal, restLenLocal < 0)` with proper 3-value stack.
2. Implemented full rest element handling in `destructureParamArray` (same pattern as `compileArrayDestructuring`).
3. Added null guard wrapping for `ref_null` params in `destructureParamArray`.
4. Fixed same stack imbalance in nested rest pattern (inner rest in statements.ts).

## Relationship to prior work
- #419 (done) fixed destructuring-specific null dereferences

## Priority: high (88 tests)

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Identify the top 3-5 codegen paths producing null dereferences
- [x] Add null guards (ref.is_null checks) before struct/array access
- [x] Fail count for null pointer dereferences reduced by at least 50%
