# Issue #245: Switch statement with string case values

## Status: done

## Summary

1 test (`S12.11_A1_T1.js`) fails in the switch statement category. The test uses a switch statement with string case values and expects specific evaluation order. The runtime returns 0 (failure), suggesting the switch matching does not correctly handle string values or the case evaluation order.

## Root Cause

The switch codegen may use reference comparison for string case values instead of value comparison. When `case "foo":` is matched against a string variable, ref equality fails even though the strings have the same content.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- switch statement codegen
- Tests affected: 1 runtime failure (but likely similar issues in compile_error tests)

## Expected Impact

Fixes 1 runtime failure and potentially prevents similar failures as more switch tests become compilable.

## Suggested Approach

1. In switch statement codegen, when the discriminant or case values are string-typed:
   - Use `__str_equals` import instead of `ref.eq` for comparison
2. Verify evaluation order: case expressions should be evaluated in order per ES spec

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Switch with string case values uses content comparison
- [ ] `S12.11_A1_T1.js` passes
- [ ] No regression in existing switch tests

## Implementation Notes

The `compileSwitchStatement` function in `statements.ts` only handled `f64.eq` and `i32.eq` for
case matching. For string-typed switch discriminants or case values, the code either:
- Forced externref strings to unbox to f64 (wrong for strings)
- Used `f64.eq` as default for ref types (wrong for native strings)

Fix: Before compiling the switch, detect if the discriminant or any case value is string-typed.
If so:
- Non-fast mode: keep discriminant as externref, use `equals` import from `wasm:js-string`
- Fast mode: keep as native string ref, flatten both operands, use `__str_equals` helper

Added `addStringImports` and `ensureNativeStringHelpers` imports to statements.ts.

## Complexity: S
