# #519 — Internal error: targetLocal is not defined (66 CE)

## Status: in-review
66 tests crash the compiler with "Internal error compiling statement: targetLocal is not defined". This is a compiler bug — a variable reference is unresolved during codegen.

Likely cause: destructuring in for-of or catch blocks where the binding variable isn't registered in the local scope before use.

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Removed a stray `emitCoercedLocalSet(ctx, fctx, targetLocal, innerElemType)` call at line 2694 of `src/codegen/statements.ts`. This call was placed *outside* the `for` loop where `targetLocal` was defined (scoped to the loop body at line 2681), causing a ReferenceError at runtime when the compiler tried to compile for-of destructuring of vec-of-vec (non-tuple) arrays.

The `local.set` was already correctly emitted inside the loop body at line 2692, making the stray line both out-of-scope and redundant.

### What worked
- Simple one-line deletion fixed the issue
- The tuple branch (line 2648) did not have this problem, confirming the stray line was a copy-paste artifact

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — removed stray `emitCoercedLocalSet` call outside its `targetLocal` scope

### Tests
- All existing equivalence tests pass (48/48)
- `for-of-array-destructuring.test.ts` specifically covers the vec-of-vec destructuring path
