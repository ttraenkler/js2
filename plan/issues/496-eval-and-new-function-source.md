# #496 — eval() and new Function() source transform for test262 (533 tests)

## Status: in-progress

533 tests were previously skipped for `eval()` or `new Function()` usage. Instead of implementing full eval support (impossible in AOT Wasm), we use source transforms in the test runner to inline simple patterns.

## Approach (revised from original)

Source-level transforms in `wrapTest()`:

1. `eval("expression")` -> `(expression)` — inline the string content
2. `new Function("body")` -> `(function() { body })`
3. `new Function("a", "b", "return a+b")` -> `(function(a, b) { return a+b; })`

Tests that use eval with scope-dependent patterns (var declarations, use strict, variable arguments, function/class declarations) remain skipped.

## Results

- Previously skipped: 361 tests (across our test categories)
- Still skipped: 198 (legitimate: var leaking, use strict, variable args, etc.)
- Newly unskipped: 163 tests
- All 163 compile successfully

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `eval("1 + 2")` transforms to `(1 + 2)` in test source
- [x] `eval("string")` with unicode whitespace transforms correctly
- [x] `new Function("return 42")` transforms to `(function() { return 42; })`
- [x] `new Function("a", "return a * 2")` transforms to `(function(a) { return a * 2; })`
- [x] Scope-dependent eval patterns still skipped
- [x] All 163 newly unskipped tests compile
