# Issue #513: Any-typed equality returns wrong results for object identity

## Problem

When comparing `any`-typed values with `===` or `!==`, object/reference identity was broken. For example:

```ts
var a: any = {};
var b: any = a;
a === b  // returned false (should be true)
```

This affected ~480+ test262 tests that returned 0 instead of their expected value.

## Root Cause

Two separate bugs in the equality comparison paths:

### 1. `__any_strict_eq` / `__any_eq` helpers (fast mode)

The AnyValue boxed-any struct uses tags to distinguish types:
- 0: null, 1: undefined, 2: i32, 3: f64, 4: bool, 5: string, 6: ref

The equality helpers only handled tags 0-4 in their comparison chain. Tags 5 (string) and 6 (ref) fell through to a `tag < 2` check which always returned false for those tags.

### 2. Externref equality path (non-fast mode / test262)

In non-fast mode, `any` types resolve to `externref`. When comparing two externrefs for equality, the code unconditionally unboxed both to `f64` via `__unbox_number` and used `f64.eq`. Objects unbox to NaN, and `NaN !== NaN`, so any two object-externrefs (even the same reference) compared as not-equal.

## Fix

### Fast mode (`__any_strict_eq` / `__any_eq`)
- Added `ref.eq` fast-path at the top: if both AnyValue struct refs are the same, return 1
- Added tag 6 (ref) handling: compare `refval` fields with `ref.eq`
- Tag 5 (string) with different AnyValue boxes still falls through (string content equality handled by string-specific codepaths)

### Non-fast mode (externref equality in expressions.ts)
- When both operands are externref and neither is a known string/number/boolean, added a reference identity check before numeric unboxing
- Uses `any.convert_extern` to convert externrefs to anyref
- Uses `ref.test` with the `eq` abstract heap type (-19) to check if values are GC refs
- If both are eqref-compatible, uses `ref.cast eq` + `ref.eq` for identity comparison
- Falls back to numeric unboxing only when the identity check doesn't apply (non-GC externrefs)

## Implementation Summary

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` - Fixed `__any_eq` and `__any_strict_eq` helpers (fast mode)
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` - Added externref identity fast-path (non-fast mode)

### What worked
- `ref.eq` fast-path on AnyValue struct refs catches all same-reference cases in fast mode
- `any.convert_extern` + `ref.test eq` + `ref.cast eq` + `ref.eq` correctly identifies same-GC-ref externrefs in non-fast mode
- Using EQ_HEAP_TYPE = -19 for the abstract `eq` heap type works with the existing LEB128 encoding in the binary emitter

### What didn't work
- Cannot use `ref.eq` directly on externrefs (not an eq type)
- Cannot use `ref.eq` directly on anyrefs (need eqref operands)
- `ref.cast` without `ref.test` would trap for non-GC externrefs (host strings/numbers)
