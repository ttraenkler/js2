# Issue #307: Promise.all and Promise.race compile errors

## Status: done

## Summary
7 tests fail in built-ins/Promise/all with compile errors. These tests call Promise methods with complex argument patterns or use patterns the codegen does not handle.

## Category
Sprint 5 / Group C

## Complexity: S

## Scope
- Support Promise.all/race with array literal arguments
- Handle Promise.all with iterables
- Ensure Promise constructor argument patterns compile
- Update Promise compilation in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Promise.all/race calls compile
- At least 5 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
The root cause of Promise compile errors was that TypeScript's `PromiseConstructor` type (with static methods `all`, `race`, `resolve`, `reject`) was missing from the compiler's bundled type libraries. The `lib-es5.ts` only had the `Promise<T>` interface (type), not the constructor (value), causing TS errors like "'Promise' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here."

Changes:
1. **`src/checker/lib-es2015.ts`**: Added `PromiseConstructor` interface with `all`, `race`, `resolve`, `reject` methods and `declare var Promise: PromiseConstructor` to make Promise available as a value.
2. **`src/codegen/expressions.ts`**: Extended Promise static method handling to also support `Promise.resolve()` and `Promise.reject()` (previously only `all`/`race`). Added `new Promise(executor)` handling in `compileNewExpression`.
3. **`src/codegen/index.ts`**: Extended `collectPromiseImports` to also scan for `resolve`, `reject` calls and `new Promise()` constructor usage, and register corresponding host imports.
4. **`src/runtime.ts`**: Added `Promise_resolve`, `Promise_reject`, and `Promise_new` host import implementations.

### What worked
- Adding the PromiseConstructor type definition resolved the TypeScript-level compile errors
- Extending the existing Promise host import pattern was straightforward

### What didn't work
- N/A

### Files changed
- `src/checker/lib-es2015.ts` (PromiseConstructor type declarations)
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` (resolve/reject/new handling)
- `src/codegen/index.ts` (import scanning)
- `src/runtime.ts` (host import implementations)
- `tests/issue-307.test.ts` (new test file)

### Tests now passing
- 7 new tests in `tests/issue-307.test.ts` covering Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, Promise.resolve() (no args), Promise.all with array literal, Promise.race with array literal, new Promise, Promise.all with function return
- All existing `tests/promise-combinators.test.ts` and `tests/async-await.test.ts` tests continue to pass
