# #1024 — Destructuring rest / hole paths still conflate null and undefined

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§13.15.5.3 Runtime Semantics: DestructuringAssignmentEvaluation](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-destructuringassignmentevaluation) — ArrayAssignmentPattern with elision and rest element
- [§7.4.2 IteratorNext](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-iteratornext) — iteration produces undefined for holes, not null


## Problem

#1021 patched destructuring **default** guards (`[a = 1] = [x]`) but did not touch:
1. **Rest elements**: `const [a, ...rest] = [null, null, 1]` — `rest` should contain `[null, 1]`, not `[undefined, 1]`
2. **Array holes (elision)**: `const [a, , b] = [1, null, 2]` — `b` should be `2`; the middle hole discards the `null` correctly, but the NEXT slot after a hole must still distinguish null from undefined

Current codegen uses `ref.is_null` on the raw element to decide "was this slot present?", which is wrong in two directions:
- A present `null` element is treated as "missing slot" → default applies
- A rest element's downstream indexing path may promote null to undefined inside the rest array

## Investigation

1. Sample failing tests in `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl` under `test/language/statements/variable/dstr/` with `null` in the input array
2. Look at `src/codegen/statements/destructuring.ts` for rest-element handling and array-hole (elision) handling
3. Find every remaining `ref.is_null` in destructuring paths that are NOT default guards (#1021 only fixed default guards)

## Fix

Two separate paths to audit:

**Rest elements** — the rest array is materialized by iterating the source. Wherever the source element is copied into the rest array, ensure `null` is preserved as `null`, not re-promoted to `undefined`. If the rest builder path pushes raw externref, it should Just Work — but if it goes through any numeric/any coercion it may lose the distinction.

**Array holes** — verify that the codegen for `[a, , b]` uses slot index (not "is this element undefined?") to advance past the hole. The hole is a *source* property, not a *value check* — `[1, null, 2][1]` returns `null`, not missing. So `b` should bind to `2` via index `[2]`, unchanged.

The likely real bug: the iterator-protocol destructuring path (for iterables, not plain arrays) uses `{ done, value }` and treats `value === undefined` as "step missing", which crashes when the iterator yields `null`.

## Expected impact

~400–800 passes. Mix of `test/language/.../dstr/` and `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/...`.

## Key files

- `src/codegen/statements/destructuring.ts`
- `src/codegen/statements/loops.ts` (if iterator-protocol path is involved for for-of destructuring)

## Acceptance

- New tests in `tests/issue-1024.test.ts` covering rest + hole + null
- Sharded CI net positive
