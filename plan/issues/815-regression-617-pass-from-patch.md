# #815 -- Regression: -617 pass from patch-rescue commits

## Problem

Pass count dropped from 15,997 (best, 2026-03-23) to 15,380 (current, 2026-03-27) on the full test suite (~49.8k tests). CE improved (1,593 → 693), but pass decreased.

## Root cause

Three "patch-rescue" commits bulk-applied code from killed agent worktrees without test validation:

1. `b8c9f083` — rescue orphaned dev patches (fallthru, illegal cast, for-of, drop) — 158 insertions
2. `09e723d2` — remove call to undefined compileForOfArrayTentative — 2 insertions
3. `98f05f2d` — apply dev patches (illegal cast guards, fallthru repair, void drops) — 410 insertions

## Key changes to investigate

- **stack-balance.ts** (~247 lines added): Complete rewrite of `fixBranchType` to use forward type-stack simulation instead of backward `inferLastType`. This is the most likely regression source — incorrect type inference could cause valid code to get wrong coercions or drops.
- **expressions.ts** (~242 lines added): ref.test guards before ref.cast in method dispatch and closure invocation. These guards may be over-triggering (similar to #789 pattern).
- **closures.ts** (~44 lines): ref.test guards in closure calls
- **property-access.ts** (~39 lines): additional ref.test guards
- **statements.ts** (~35 lines): void context drop fixes + for-of changes

## Bisection plan

1. Test at `f7929f2c` (after #812, before patch-rescue) — should match ~15,997 baseline
2. Test at `b8c9f083` (after first patch-rescue) — isolates first batch
3. Test at `98f05f2d` (after second batch) — isolates second batch
4. If both contribute, selectively revert changes by file

## Regression analysis (test-by-test comparison)

Compared `56691a8e` (pre-patch-rescue, 39,818 tests) with current (49,861 tests):
- **2,063 regressions** (pass → fail/ce)
- **3,432 improvements** (fail/ce → pass)
- Net: +1,369 improvements, but 2,063 previously-passing tests now fail

### Regression error breakdown (2,063 total)
| Pattern | Count | Likely cause |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| assert #1 failed (wrong value) | **1,655** | **stack-balance.ts rewrite** |
| assert #N failed | 153 | stack-balance.ts |
| null-related | 114 | ref.test guards |
| TypeError over-trigger | 113 | ref.test guards (#789) |
| not a function | 15 | closure/method dispatch |
| SyntaxError | 10 | misc |
| compile_error | 3 | misc |

**80% of regressions are wrong-value failures** — the stack-balance forward simulation is the primary suspect. It's producing incorrect type coercions or drops that change computation results.

### Sample regressed tests
- `Array.isArray([])` returns false (should be true)
- `x.length` returns wrong value after array operations
- `assert.sameValue(result, true)` fails on boolean comparisons

## Fix approach

1. **Primary**: Revert `stack-balance.ts` forward simulation back to backward `inferLastType` — this is causing 1,800+ wrong-value regressions
2. **Secondary**: Review ref.test guards for over-triggering (227 regressions)
3. Keep other changes that improved CE count (693 vs 1,593)

## Files to modify
- `src/codegen/stack-balance.ts`
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`
- `src/codegen/closures.ts`
- `src/codegen/property-access.ts`
- `src/codegen/statements.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Pass count ≥ 15,997 (restore to previous best)
- CE count stays ≤ 693 (keep CE improvements)
- No new runtime traps

## Implementation Notes

The root cause was `fixStructNewUnderflow` in `stack-balance.ts`, added between
the known-good state (`56691a8e`) and the current HEAD. This function tracked
stack depth linearly per-body, starting at 0 for each inner block body
(if-then, if-else, block, loop, try/catch). However, struct.new instructions
inside those inner bodies can consume values pushed in the outer scope (before
the block). The function incorrectly detected "underflows" and padded with
default values (0, ref.null), corrupting struct fields.

Example: if values are pushed before an if-block and struct.new appears inside
the then-branch, the inner depth counter starts at 0 but the actual stack has
the values from the outer scope. The function would pad with zeros, pushing
the actual values to wrong field positions.

Fix: Removed `fixStructNewUnderflow` entirely. This restores stack-balance.ts
to the known-good state at `56691a8e`. Genuine struct.new underflows (missing
field values) will manifest as compile errors caught by the Wasm validator,
which is preferable to silently corrupting values at runtime.

## Complexity: M
