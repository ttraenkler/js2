# #457 — WeakMap/WeakSet via host imports

## Problem
React-reconciler uses WeakMap for metadata caching (fiber → metadata). WasmGC has no weak reference primitive. Implementing via host imports is pragmatic — it works, and can be replaced with native Wasm weak refs when the proposal lands.

## Approach
Delegate to JS-side WeakMap/WeakSet via host imports. Each WeakMap/WeakSet instance is an opaque `externref` handle.

## Host Imports
```
__weakmap_new() -> externref
__weakmap_get(map: externref, key: externref) -> externref
__weakmap_set(map: externref, key: externref, value: externref) -> void
__weakmap_has(map: externref, key: externref) -> i32
__weakmap_delete(map: externref, key: externref) -> i32
__weakset_new() -> externref
__weakset_add(set: externref, value: externref) -> void
__weakset_has(set: externref, value: externref) -> i32
__weakset_delete(set: externref, value: externref) -> i32
```

## Implementation
- Detect `new WeakMap()`, `new WeakSet()` in codegen
- Compile method calls (`.get()`, `.set()`, `.has()`, `.delete()`) to host import calls
- Box keys/values to externref before passing to host
- Add imports to `addUnionImports` or a new `addCollectionImports` function
- Update `src/runtime.ts` with the JS-side implementations

## Test Impact
- Unblocks WeakMap/WeakSet test262 tests (currently skipped)
- Required by react-reconciler for fiber metadata caching

## Acceptance Criteria
- `new WeakMap()` compiles and works
- `.get()`, `.set()`, `.has()`, `.delete()` all work correctly
- Keys are weakly held (GC can collect unreferenced keys)
- WeakSet equivalent works
