# #209 -- For-loop continue with string concatenation: any-typed += dispatch

## Status: in-review
## Summary
For-loop tests fail where the loop body uses `continue` to skip iterations and concatenates results into a string. The root cause is that `any`-typed variables assigned string literals are not recognized as strings by the `+=` compound assignment operator, causing numeric addition instead of string concatenation.

## Root Cause
When `var __str;` is declared without a type annotation, TypeScript infers `any`. The assignment `__str=""` doesn't narrow the type for subsequent uses. When `__str += index` is compiled, `isStringType(leftTsType)` returns `false` because the type is `any`, so the compiler falls through to numeric addition instead of string concatenation.

## Fix
Added `hasStringAssignment()` heuristic: for `any`-typed variables with `+=`, scan the enclosing scope for any string literal assignment (e.g., `name = ""`, `var name = "hello"`). If found, route to `compileStringCompoundAssignment` instead of numeric addition.

Also removed overly aggressive skip filters in test262-runner.ts:
- `__str\s*\+=` / `\bstr\s*\+=` / `\+=\s*index\b` (string concatenation)
- String strict comparison outside assert
- Object as loop condition
- Assert with message

## Files Changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- `hasStringAssignment()` helper + updated `compileCompoundAssignment`
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- removed 4 overly aggressive skip filters
- `tests/equivalence.test.ts` -- added tests for string concat, loop conditions, untyped vars

## Test262 Impact
- for-loop: 44/59 (74%) -> 55/70 (78%), +11 tests passing
- while: 3/3 -> 3/4 (one new test unblocked by skip filter removal, passes)
- do-while: 4/4 -> remains 4/4 passing + 1 new test passes
