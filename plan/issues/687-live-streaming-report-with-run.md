# #687 — Live-streaming report with run selector and progress indicator

## Status: open

### Requirements
1. **Run selector dropdown** — lists all runs from results/runs/*.jsonl, defaults to latest
2. **Live streaming** — if the selected run is in progress, poll the JSONL every 5s and update charts/tables incrementally without page reload
3. **Progress indicator** — show "X / Y tests (Z%)" bar when a run is active
4. **Auto-detect active run** — check if test262 workers are running (via a meta.json status field)

### Approach
- Load run list from results/runs/ directory listing
- For live runs: fetch JSONL with Range header (only new bytes since last fetch)
- Parse new lines incrementally, update summary counts and category table
- Show a pulsing progress bar at the top when streaming

## Complexity: M
