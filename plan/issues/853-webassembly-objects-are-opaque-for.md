# #853 -- WebAssembly objects are opaque: for-in and Object.create property enumeration (58 tests)

## Problem

58 tests fail with "WebAssembly objects are opaque" when JavaScript code tries to enumerate or inspect properties of Wasm struct objects. This happens in `for-in` loops and `Object.create` with property descriptors -- the JS host cannot see inside Wasm GC structs.

### Sample files with exact errors and source

**1. for-in enumerable shadowed properties**
File: `test/language/statements/for-in/order-enumerable-shadowed.js`
Error: `WebAssembly objects are opaque`
```js
// Lines 11-22:
var proto = { p2: 'p2' };
var o = Object.create(proto, {
  'p1': { value: 'p1', enumerable: true },
  'p2': { value: 'p1', enumerable: false },
});
var keys = [];
for (var key in o) { keys.push(key); }
```
Root cause: `for-in` on a Wasm struct object fails because the JS host cannot enumerate its properties.

**2. Object.create with property descriptors**
File: `test/built-ins/Object/create/15.2.3.5-4-308.js`
Error: `WebAssembly objects are opaque`
Root cause: `Object.create` with a second argument (property descriptors) tries to define properties on a Wasm struct, which is opaque to JS.

**3. Object.create with accessor descriptors**
File: `test/built-ins/Object/create/15.2.3.5-4-39.js`
Error: `WebAssembly objects are opaque`

**4. Object.create with data descriptors**
File: `test/built-ins/Object/create/15.2.3.5-4-46.js`
Error: `WebAssembly objects are opaque`

**5. Object.create with enumerable check**
File: `test/built-ins/Object/create/15.2.3.5-4-312.js`
Error: `WebAssembly objects are opaque`

## Root cause in compiler

Wasm GC structs are not directly inspectable from JavaScript. When compiled objects are passed to `for-in`, `Object.keys`, `Object.create`, etc., the JS host sees an opaque Wasm struct and cannot enumerate its fields.

This is a fundamental limitation of the Wasm GC ↔ JS boundary. Objects that need to be inspectable by JS host code must either:
1. Use externref-based property maps instead of Wasm struct fields
2. Implement property enumeration as a Wasm export that returns the key list

Primary file: `src/codegen/index.ts` (object/struct creation), `src/codegen/expressions.ts` (for-in compilation)

## Suggested fix

1. For objects that may be passed to `for-in` or property reflection APIs:
   - Store properties in a JS-side Map (via host import) in addition to or instead of Wasm struct fields
   - Export a `getOwnPropertyNames` helper that returns the list of keys

2. For `for-in` compilation:
   - Emit a call to a host import that enumerates the object's properties
   - The host import checks if the object is opaque and falls back to the Wasm-side property map

3. For `Object.create`:
   - Implement property descriptor application via host imports that can work with both opaque and non-opaque objects

## Acceptance criteria

- for-in on compiler-created objects enumerates properties correctly
- Object.create with property descriptors works on compiler objects
- >=40 of 58 tests fixed
