# #951 -- Unused imports cause "Missing initializer in const declaration" compile error

## Problem

When an ES module import binding is not used in the source code, the compiler emits "Missing initializer in const declaration" instead of silently dropping the unused import. This causes compilation failures for real-world code that imports more bindings than it directly uses.

### Reproduction

```typescript
// FAILS: "Missing initializer in const declaration"
import { a, b } from "./x.js";
a();  // only 'a' is used, 'b' is unused

// WORKS: all imports are used
import { a, b } from "./x.js";
a(); b();

// FAILS: unused default import
import state from "./state.js";

// FAILS: unused star import is OK, but subsequent unused named imports fail
import * as THREE from "three";
import { foo } from "./bar.js";  // ← foo unused
```

### Impact

Blocks compilation of `game-loop.ts` (THREE.js game loop test) which imports from 10 modules but only uses a subset of bindings per function. Also affects any real-world code with imports used only in some code paths.

## Proposed fix

When processing import declarations, if a binding is not referenced in the code:
1. Skip codegen for that binding (don't create a local/global)
2. Do NOT report an error — unused imports are valid JS/TS

This is essentially tree-shaking at the import level — the compiler already has `treeshake.ts` for function-level dead code elimination. The import case just needs the unused binding to be ignored rather than treated as an uninitialized const.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `import { a, b } from "./x.js"; a();` compiles without error (b silently dropped)
- [ ] `import foo from "./bar.js";` compiles without error even if foo is unused
- [ ] game-loop.ts import errors resolved
- [ ] No regression in test pass count
