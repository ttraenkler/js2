# Issue 38: Implement `instanceof` operator

## Status: done

## Summary

Add support for the TypeScript `instanceof` operator using a hidden `__tag` field on class structs. Each class gets a unique compile-time tag value, and `instanceof` checks compare the tag.

## Motivation

The `instanceof` operator is a fundamental TypeScript/JavaScript feature for runtime type checking. Since Wasm GC's isorecursive type system canonicalizes structurally identical types (making `ref.test` unable to distinguish them), a tag-based approach provides correct nominal type discrimination.

## Design

### Compilation strategy

`expr instanceof ClassName` compiles to:

1. Compile left operand (the value) — pushes a ref onto the stack
2. Emit `struct.get` to read the hidden `__tag` field (field index 0)
3. Emit `i32.const` with the class's compile-time tag value
4. Emit `i32.eq` — returns i32 (0 or 1)

### Class struct modification

Every local class gets a hidden `__tag` field (i32, immutable) at field index 0. The tag value is assigned from a counter (`classTagCounter`) during `collectClassDeclaration`. The constructor sets the tag via `struct.new` initialization.

### Why not `ref.test`?

In Wasm GC's isorecursive type system, structurally identical struct types in separate singleton rec groups are canonicalized to the same type. This means `ref.test` returns true for any struct with the same layout, even if it's a different class. The tag-based approach provides correct nominal discrimination.

## Files modified

- `src/codegen/index.ts` — added `classTagCounter` and `classTagMap` to context, added `__tag` field to class structs, constructor initializes tag
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — added `compileInstanceOf` function, `InstanceOfKeyword` dispatch in `compileBinaryExpression`
- `tests/instanceof.test.ts` — 4 tests

## Test plan

- `instanceof` with matching class → returns 1 (true) [PASS]
- `instanceof` with non-matching class → returns 0 (false) [PASS]
- `instanceof` used in if-statement for type narrowing [PASS]
- `instanceof` with multiple checks on different classes [PASS]
