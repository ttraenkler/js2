# #1001 -- Preallocate counted `number[]` push loops into dense WasmGC arrays

## Problem

The landing-page `array.ts` benchmark lost its old Wasm advantage even on the
optimized path.

Current lowering already uses WasmGC storage, but it still goes through a
generic growable vec wrapper:

- backing store: `(array (mut f64))`
- wrapper: `(struct (field $length i32) (field $data (ref null $__arr_f64)))`

For the benchmark pattern

```ts
const arr: number[] = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) arr.push(i);
let total = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) total += arr[i];
```

the emitted hot path still performs:

- per-iteration capacity checks
- reallocation / `array.copy` growth logic
- wrapper field traffic for logical length
- extra `i32 <-> f64` conversions around indices and length checks

This is amortically fine as a generic runtime strategy, but it is not the
right lowering for a counted fill loop with statically obvious final size.

## Evidence

The generated WAT for `bench_array` currently shows:

- `push` lowering via wrapper bookkeeping and geometric growth
- backing array growth by `max((len + 1) * 2, 4)`
- sum loop repeatedly re-reading wrapper length and converting through
  `f64.convert_i32_s` / `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s`

Representative WAT excerpt:

```wat
(type $__arr_f64 (array (mut f64)))
(type $__vec_f64 (struct (field $length (mut i32)) (field $data (mut (ref null 0)))))
...
local.get 3
struct.get 1 0
local.set 5
local.get 3
struct.get 1 1
local.tee 4
array.len
local.get 5
i32.const 1
i32.add
i32.lt_s
(if
  (then
    ...
    array.copy 0 0
    ...
  )
)
...
local.get 0
struct.get 1 0
f64.convert_i32_s
i32.trunc_sat_f64_s
```

Observed benchmark state after enabling optimized output:

- committed baseline: `array.ts` ratio `3.02x` (`wasmUs 37.27`, `jsUs 112.40`)
- local rerun: ratio `0.77x` (`wasmUs 40.14`, `jsUs 30.98`)
- CI rerun: ratio `0.60x` (`wasmUs 59.84`, `jsUs 36.00`)

So the old headline win is gone, and the generic dynamic-growth lowering is a
plausible direct cause.

## What to do

1. Detect the counted fill pattern:
   - `const arr: number[] = []`
   - monotonic counted loop
   - `arr.push(expr)` in the loop body
   - no escaping alias of `arr` before fill completes
2. When the final element count is statically derivable, preallocate exact or
   sufficiently tight capacity up front.
3. Lower the fill loop to direct indexed `array.set` writes on the backing
   WasmGC array, without per-iteration growth checks.
4. Hoist final length / bound metadata so the subsequent sum loop can:
   - read length once
   - stay on `i32` for loop control
   - avoid redundant `i32 <-> f64` conversions
5. Keep the generic growable vec-wrapper path as the fallback for non-provable
   dynamic append cases.
6. Add focused regression tests for:
   - exact preallocation on counted numeric append loops
   - unchanged semantics when array escapes or loop trip count is not provable
   - benchmark-style `fill + sum` path producing tighter WAT

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§23.1.3.22 Array.prototype.push](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.push) — step 5: Set(O, ToString(len), E); step 6: update length property after each push


## Acceptance criteria

- counted `number[]` append loops no longer emit geometric growth logic inside
  the loop when final size is statically known
- resulting WAT for the benchmark-style path removes `array.copy` from the hot
  loop and substantially reduces index/length conversion churn
- generic dynamic array behavior remains correct for non-optimizable cases
- `examples/benchmarks/array.ts` recovers a material Wasm speedup locally and
  no longer trips the benchmark-regression gate on normal CI variance

## Notes

This is primarily a lowering/specialization issue, not a substrate issue:

- the current implementation already uses WasmGC arrays
- the missing piece is recognizing that this benchmark does not need a generic
  growable wrapper at runtime

This issue is orthogonal to the currently broken `fast: true` benchmark path,
which still fails in `__str_copy_tree` before useful timings can be collected.

## Test Results

### Benchmark (200 runs, fill+sum 10k elements)
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Wasm | 0.10ms/run | 0.06ms/run |
| JS | 0.07ms/run | 0.07ms/run |
| Ratio | 1.54x (slower) | 0.73x (faster) |

### Correctness (7/7 pass)
- counted push loop (basic): PASS
- counted push loop (expression): PASS
- non-counted loop (while) — no prealloc: PASS
- push after loop still works: PASS
- empty array no loop: PASS
- large prealloc sum (10k): PASS
- prefix increment loop: PASS

## Implementation

Added `detectCountedPushLoopSize()` in `src/codegen/literals.ts`. When an empty
array literal `[]` is followed by a counted for-loop that only pushes to it
(`for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) arr.push(expr)`), the backing WasmGC array is
preallocated to size N instead of 0. The push code still runs but the capacity
check never triggers, eliminating all growth/`array.copy` overhead at runtime.
