# #761 -- Rest/spread elements silently dropped in destructuring (5 codegen paths)

## Status: in-progress

## Problem

Rest elements (`...rest`) in destructuring patterns are silently skipped in 5 codegen locations, producing incorrect results with no error:

1. **Array destructuring on externref** (`statements.ts:1307`) — `const [a, ...rest] = externArray` skips rest
2. **String destructuring** (`statements.ts:1759`) — `const [a, ...rest] = "hello"` not supported
3. **Tuple rest** (`expressions.ts:2445`) — needs type conversion for remaining elements
4. **Assignment destructuring on externref** (`expressions.ts:2655`) — `[a, ...rest] = externArr` skips rest
5. **For-of assignment destructuring on non-array iterables** (`statements.ts:3727`) — throws error

These silent drops cause subtle wrong-value failures that are hard to diagnose.

### Fix approach

For externref arrays:
1. Use `__array_slice` or equivalent to capture remaining elements into a new array
2. Assign the sliced array to the rest binding

For strings:
1. Convert remaining characters via `string.substring` + split into array

For tuples:
1. Collect remaining tuple fields into an array struct

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria

- Rest elements in array destructuring produce correct values
- Rest elements in assignment destructuring produce correct values
- String destructuring with rest captures remaining characters
- No silent drops — either implement or throw a clear compile error
