# Issue #250: For-loop with function declarations (113 compile errors)

## Status: in-progress

## Summary

113 tests in `language/statements/for/` fail to compile. Many involve function declarations inside for-loop bodies, labeled loops, or complex loop constructs that combine multiple unsupported patterns. This was deferred from Sprint 2.

## Root Cause

Function declarations inside for-loop bodies create scope challenges. The function may reference the loop variable (closure), or the function declaration may need hoisting to the loop body scope. The codegen does not handle function declarations in all statement positions within loop bodies.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- for-loop body statement handling
- Tests affected: ~113 compile errors

## Expected Impact

Fixing function declarations in loop bodies could resolve ~40-60 of the 113 errors (others have additional issues).

## Suggested Approach

1. Treat function declarations inside for-loop bodies as function expressions assigned to a local variable
2. Ensure the function captures the loop variable correctly (closure over ref cell)
3. Handle labeled for-loops with function declarations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Function declarations inside for-loop bodies compile
- [ ] Loop variable captures work correctly
- [ ] At least 40 compile errors resolved

## Complexity: M
