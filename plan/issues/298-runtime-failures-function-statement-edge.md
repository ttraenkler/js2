# Issue #298: Runtime failures -- function statement edge cases

## Status: done

## Summary
7 tests in language/statements/function fail at runtime. These involve function hoisting behavior, nested function captures, and test runner preprocessing issues.

## Category
Sprint 5 / Group B

## Complexity: M (turned out larger than S)

## Scope
- Analyze the failing function tests to identify specific patterns
- Fix mutable capture mechanism for nested function declarations
- Fix argument padding bug that ignored capture params
- Fix test runner stripping side effects from undefined comparisons
- Fix hoisting failure preventing re-compilation at statement position

## Acceptance criteria
- Function statement runtime failures resolved
- No regressions in existing tests

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Four distinct bugs were identified and fixed:

1. **Mutable captures for nested function declarations** (`statements.ts`, `expressions.ts`, `index.ts`):
   Nested function declarations (via `compileNestedFunctionDeclaration`) passed captured variables by value, not by reference. When a nested function wrote to a captured variable (e.g., `x = 1`), the change was lost because only a copy was modified. Added ref cell support (matching the existing pattern used for arrow/function expressions) so that mutable captures use `struct { field $value (mut T) }` wrappers. The call site creates the ref cell, and the nested function reads/writes through it.

2. **Capture param double-counting in argument padding** (`expressions.ts`):
   When calling a nested function with captures, the compiler's argument padding logic (`totalPushed` calculation) did not account for the capture values already pushed before user arguments. This caused extra default values to be pushed, corrupting the stack. Fixed by tracking `captureCount` and including it in `totalPushed`. This also fixed a pre-existing bug where `codegen.test.ts > nested function capturing outer local` returned 0 instead of 142.

3. **Test runner stripping side effects** (`test262-runner.ts`):
   `stripUndefinedThrowGuards` removed `if (expr !== undefined) { throw ... }` blocks entirely, losing side effects from function calls in the condition (e.g., `__func() !== undefined`). Fixed by extracting and preserving function call expressions from the condition.

4. **Hoisting failure preventing re-compilation** (`statements.ts`):
   When a nested function captured a `const`/`let` variable, hoisting failed because the variable wasn't in `localMap` yet. The function was added to `hoistFailedFuncs` and never retried. Removed the `hoistFailedFuncs` skip so functions are re-attempted during normal statement compilation when the captured variables are available.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- mutable capture detection, ref cell setup, hoisting retry
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- ref cell wrapping at call site, capture param counting fix
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- extended `nestedFuncCaptures` type with `mutable` and `valType`
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- preserve side effects in `stripUndefinedThrowGuards`
- `tests/issue-298.test.ts` -- 6 new equivalence tests

### Test results
- 10 failed test files (was 11 on main) -- fixed `codegen.test.ts` closure capture test
- 24 failed tests (was 26 on main) -- net improvement of 2 tests
- 0 regressions
