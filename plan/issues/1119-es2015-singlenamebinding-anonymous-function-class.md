# #1119 — ES2015 SingleNameBinding anonymous function/class naming from destructuring context

## Problem

**~203 test262 failures in the `*-fn-name-*` family** (71 `null_deref`, 77 `assertion_fail`, 24 `runtime_error`, 13 `type_error`, 6 `compile_error`, 12 already pass in current baseline `benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260418-151655.jsonl`) exercise the ES2015 "anonymous function naming" rule applied at destructuring sites.

Per spec:
- **13.3.3.6 step 6d** — Array SingleNameBinding: `BindingElement : SingleNameBinding Initializer_opt` → if `Initializer` is an anonymous function definition, `SetFunctionName(v, bindingId)`
- **13.3.3.7 step 5e** — Object SingleNameBinding: same rule for object destructuring
- Applies to any `IsAnonymousFunctionDefinition(Initializer)`: `class {}`, `function () {}`, `() => {}`

The narrow sub-cluster this issue focuses on is the **`*-fn-name-class.js`** pattern — 71 `null_deref` failures where the default initializer is a class expression (`class {}`).

Example (`test/language/statements/class/dstr/meth-static-ary-ptrn-elem-id-init-fn-name-class.js`):

```js
class C {
  static method([cls = class {}]) {
    // cls.name === 'cls' — per 13.3.3.6 step 6d "If Initializer is present and
    // IsAnonymousFunctionDefinition(Initializer) is true, then SetFunctionName(v, bindingId)"
  }
}
```

Current behavior: `null_deref` (or `type_error` / `runtime_error` depending on call path) at the destructuring-default site — the class struct has no `.name` property set, so property access on `.name` traps.

## Scope

Files matching `*-fn-name-class.js` in `test/language/**/dstr/`:
- 203 total in current baseline
- Breakdown: 71 `null_deref`, 24 `runtime_error`, 13 `type_error`, 77 `assertion_fail`, 6 `compile_error`, 12 already pass

Covers both:
- **Array dstr** (13.3.3.6): `[cls = class {}]`
- **Object dstr** (13.3.3.7): `{cls = class {}}`

And all containing constructs:
- Function parameters: `function f([cls = class {}]) {}`
- Class methods: `class C { m([cls = class {}]) {} }`, including static/generator/async-generator/private variants
- For-of: `for (const [cls = class {}] of iter) {}`
- Variable declarations: `const [cls = class {}] = arr`

## Why this needs an architect spec

This is **ES2015 feature work**, not a mechanical bug fix. Four reasons:

1. **Spec rule is cross-cutting.** Anonymous function naming lives in 13.3.3.6 step 6d / 13.3.3.7 step 5e — separate from the destructuring algorithm itself. The compiler currently has no notion of "set `.name` at the destructuring site from the binding identifier."

2. **Synthesizing `.name` on a class struct.** The compiler needs to set the WasmGC string `.name` field of the class object to the binding identifier text. Class representation and where `.name` is stored must be confirmed by architect before touching codegen.

3. **Must detect `IsAnonymousFunctionDefinition(Initializer)`.** Applies to `class {}`, `function () {}`, arrow `() => {}`, and named-via-computed-property. Detection must happen at the binding element, not inside the expression emitter.

4. **Multiple touch points — consistency required.** The `.name` assignment must happen at every destructuring emit site:
   - `src/codegen/destructuring-params.ts` — `destructureParamArray`, `destructureParamObject`
   - `src/codegen/loops.ts` — `compileForOfDestructuring`
   - Variable-declaration destructuring (statements.ts)
   All four sites need consistent handling, or you get feature drift across contexts.

## Touch points identified (preliminary probe)

- `src/codegen/destructuring-params.ts` — emits function-parameter destructuring for standalone functions, class methods, object methods, private methods, closures, nested declarations. Default-initializer path lives around the `ref.null`/sentinel branches.
- `src/codegen/loops.ts` — `compileForOfDestructuring` (separate path from function params, handles `for (const [...] of ...)`)
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — variable-declaration destructuring (`const [x] = ...`)
- `src/codegen/classes.ts` (or wherever class structs are emitted) — need to confirm where `.name` field lives on the class struct and how to write to it from codegen

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] **Architect produces `## Implementation Plan` in this file** with:
  - Exact call sites that emit destructuring defaults (names + line numbers)
  - How to detect `IsAnonymousFunctionDefinition(Initializer)` from the TS AST (including covered cases: class expr, function expr, arrow)
  - Where `.name` is stored on a class struct and how to write to it
  - Whether to handle this at the destructuring site or via a helper that rewrites the anonymous expression pre-emit
  - Answer: does array + object + for-of + var-decl + fn-param all share one helper, or four separate patches?
- [ ] **Regression tests** in `tests/issue-1119.test.ts` cover at minimum:
  - Array dstr: `[cls = class {}]` — assert `cls.name === 'cls'`
  - Object dstr: `{cls = class {}}` — assert `cls.name === 'cls'`
  - Function param default with anonymous class
  - For-of default with anonymous class
  - Variable-decl default with anonymous class
  - Arrow-function default (`[fn = () => 1]` → `fn.name === 'fn'`)
- [ ] **50+ `*-fn-name-class.js` test262 tests flip from `null_deref` → `pass`** (expect some to remain failing on unrelated issues: privileged member access, async-generator semantics, etc.)

## Related

- Sprint 42 #825 residual bucket — parent issue covering 143 class/dstr failures; `fn-name-class` cluster was deferred out of it
- Task #14 "Fix class/dstr fn-name-class null-deref cluster (47 tests)" completed earlier with a partial fix (null-check on `.name` access). That shipped a safe default but did NOT implement the spec rule. The remaining 71+ tests require setting the actual `.name` value per 13.3.3.6/7.
- PR #209 fixed nested rest-in-rest destructuring in for-of and fn-param contexts — same mental model (destructuring codegen touches multiple emit sites), but a different spec rule.
- Spec: <https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-iteratorbindinginitialization> (steps 6d/5e)
- Test262 baseline: `benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260418-151655.jsonl`

## Dispatch notes

Route to architect for implementation spec before dev dispatch. Feasibility: **hard** because the fix crosses destructuring + class codegen + property-access boundaries and must be consistent across 4-5 emit sites. `reasoning_effort: high` — architect should read at least `destructuring-params.ts`, `loops.ts`, `statements.ts`, and the class codegen path before writing the plan.
