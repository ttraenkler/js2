# #917 -- Make lint, format, and typecheck apply consistently across the whole source tree

## Problem

Current quality scripts do not project the feeling of a uniformly maintained codebase.

In particular, linting currently targets a small set of files rather than the whole source tree, which suggests:

- the repo is too inconsistent to check broadly
- contributors need maintainer judgment to know what quality bar applies where

That is a deterrent for outside engineers.

## Goal

Make formatting, linting, and typechecking feel like default project-wide expectations instead of selective spot checks.

## Requirements

1. Apply formatting and linting consistently across relevant source directories
2. Keep the rules practical enough that the transition is maintainable
3. Ensure CI runs the same contributor-facing checks that local docs recommend
4. Document any intentionally excluded paths
5. Avoid expanding the surface so aggressively that the repo becomes impossible to clean incrementally

## Acceptance criteria

- quality scripts apply consistently enough that contributors understand the default bar
- CI reflects those same default checks
- the project feels less ad hoc from a maintenance perspective
