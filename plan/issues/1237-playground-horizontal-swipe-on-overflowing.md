# #1223 — Horizontal swipe on overflowing tab bar drags tab instead of scrolling

## Problem

On mobile (touch), when the tab bar in a playground panel has more tabs
than fit horizontally, the user's natural intent for a horizontal swipe is
to **scroll** the bar to reach off-screen tabs. Instead, the swipe
initiates a drag-and-drop and the touched tab gets pulled out of the bar,
re-laying-out the panel. The bar **is** scrollable
(`.panel-tab-bar { overflow-x: auto }` at `playground/index.html:497`),
but the gesture never reaches the browser's scroll handler.

## Repro

1. Open https://js2.loopdive.com on a phone (or DevTools touch emulation).
2. Navigate to a playground layout that has enough tabs in one bar to
   overflow horizontally — e.g. open a few of the
   `examples/benchmarks/*.ts` files.
3. Try to swipe the tab bar left/right to scroll to a tab that's off-screen.

Expected: the tab bar scrolls horizontally, revealing off-screen tabs.
Actual: the touched tab starts a drag-and-drop, drop overlays appear, and
on touchend the tab is moved into a different panel.

## Root cause

Two interacting decisions force every horizontal touch into a drag:

1. **`playground/index.html:523`** sets `.panel-tab { touch-action: none }`,
   which tells the browser to skip its built-in touch gesture handling on
   tab elements (so the script can implement its own).
2. **`playground/layout.ts:476–491`** registers a `pointerdown` handler
   that, for any non-mouse pointer, immediately calls
   `e.preventDefault()` and `tabEl.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId)`. From
   that point the browser cannot deliver scroll gestures to the bar; the
   handler then waits for 10px of movement (`Math.hypot(dx, dy) < 10` at
   line 499) and starts the drag in any direction.

Because the preventDefault / capture happens on pointerdown — before the
script has any signal about scroll-vs-drag intent — horizontal scroll on
an overflowing bar is impossible.

## Acceptance criteria

1. On a tab bar whose `scrollWidth > clientWidth` (i.e. tabs overflow),
   a horizontal touch-drag scrolls the bar natively. No drag-and-drop is
   initiated and no drop overlay appears.
2. On the same overflowing bar, a clearly **vertical** touch-drag (intent
   to lift the tab out of the bar) still initiates the existing drag flow
   so users can re-arrange tabs across panels.
3. On a non-overflowing tab bar (`scrollWidth === clientWidth`), behaviour
   is unchanged: any drag direction can move the tab.
4. Tap-to-activate on a tab continues to work in both states (no
   regression to `suppressTabClickId` flow).
5. Mouse drag (`pointerType === "mouse"`) is unaffected — it still uses
   the native HTML5 dragstart path.

## Implementation sketch

In `setupTabDrag` (`playground/layout.ts:452`):

1. On pointerdown, capture `startX/startY` and the pointerId but **do
   not** call `preventDefault()` and **do not** `setPointerCapture` yet.
   Mark the gesture pending.
2. Add a `pointermove` listener that, on the first move past the 10px
   threshold:
   - Computes `dx = ev.clientX - startX`, `dy = ev.clientY - startY`.
   - Looks up the enclosing `.panel-tab-bar` and checks
     `scrollWidth > clientWidth + EPSILON` (overflowing).
   - If overflowing **and** `Math.abs(dx) > Math.abs(dy)` (predominantly
     horizontal), abandon the drag intent and let the browser handle the
     gesture as a scroll. Remove the listeners; do **not** call
     `preventDefault`. The bar's `overflow-x: auto` plus the absent
     `touch-action: none` will scroll naturally.
   - Otherwise, commit to the drag: `preventDefault`, set pointer
     capture, mark `started`, and continue with the existing flow.
3. Switch `.panel-tab { touch-action: none }` to
   `.panel-tab { touch-action: pan-x }` (or `pan-y` — pick whichever
   axis we want the browser to keep). `pan-x` lets the browser scroll
   the parent bar horizontally when the script doesn't preventDefault,
   which is exactly the contract we want.

The CSS change alone is not sufficient — without the move-direction
gate, vertical drags would also fail to initiate the cross-panel
drop. The two changes are paired.

## Test plan

- Manual check on iOS Safari and Chrome DevTools touch emulation:
  - Overflowing bar → horizontal swipe scrolls.
  - Overflowing bar → vertical swipe lifts tab into drag.
  - Non-overflowing bar → any direction lifts tab into drag.
  - Tap on a tab activates it (no drag triggered).
- No regressions in the existing mouse drag-and-drop flow on desktop.

## Workaround in the meantime

Tap individual tabs to activate them; close some tabs to reduce the bar
width below the panel width before reaching for off-screen tabs.
