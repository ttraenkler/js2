# #968 — Block scope variable dedup merges locals that should stay separate

## Problem

~25 tests fail with assertion errors like `assert.sameValue(x, 'outer')` after #954 dedup locals. The deduplication merges local variables from sibling block scopes that should remain separate.

## Sample files

- test/language/block-scope/leave/verify-context-in-labelled-block.js
- test/language/block-scope/leave/try-block-let-declaration-only-shadows-outer-parameter-value-2.js

## Likely Cause

#954's `deduplicateLocals()` in src/codegen/context/locals.ts merges locals with the same name across different block scopes. But sibling blocks (e.g. `{ let x = 'inner' } { let x = 'outer' }`) need separate locals even though they share a name.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Block-scoped variables in sibling scopes are not merged
- No assertion failures on variable shadow tests
