# Issue #268: Iterator protocol -- Type must have a Symbol.iterator method

## Status: done

## Summary
~100+ tests fail with "Type X must have a [Symbol.iterator]()' method that returns an iterator". For-of loops and spread on non-array iterables (strings, Maps, Sets, custom iterables) require iterator protocol support. Currently only arrays are supported for for-of.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group D

## Complexity: L

## Scope (partial -- strings only)
- Implement iterator protocol for for-of on strings (iterate chars)
- Map/Set and spread support deferred to future issues

## Acceptance criteria
- For-of over strings compiles and iterates characters

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
1. Added `compileForOfString()` in `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- a new function that compiles `for (const c of someString)` by iterating character-by-character using the native `__str_charAt` helper. Uses the same block/loop pattern as the existing array for-of.
2. Updated `compileForOfStatement()` to detect string types (via `isStringType()`) in fast mode and route to `compileForOfString()` instead of falling through to the externref-based `compileForOfIterator()`.
3. Fixed a pre-existing bug in `collectIteratorImports()` in `src/codegen/index.ts`: when a for-of loop on a string was detected, it would register iterator host imports (`__iterator`, `__iterator_next`, etc.) which are unnecessary in fast mode. These late imports shifted function indices and broke `__str_copy_tree`'s recursive calls. Added a check to skip string types in fast mode.

### What worked
- The native string infrastructure (`__str_charAt`, AnyString struct with length field 0) was already in place. The for-of implementation simply reads the string length from the struct and calls charAt in a loop.
- Reused the same break/continue stack pattern from `compileForOfArray`.

### What didn't
- The `__str_copy_tree` function index corruption was a subtle pre-existing bug that only manifested when both native strings and iterator imports were present in the same module.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- added `compileForOfString()`, updated `compileForOfStatement()` dispatch
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- fixed `collectIteratorImports()` to skip strings in fast mode
- `tests/issue-268.test.ts` -- 4 new tests

### Tests now passing
- for-of on string literal (count characters)
- for-of on string variable
- for-of on empty string
- break inside for-of on string
