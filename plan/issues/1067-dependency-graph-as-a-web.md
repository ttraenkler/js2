# #1067 — Dependency graph as a web component

## Goal

Turn the current Markdown issue dependency graph (`plan/log/dependency-graph.md`)
into an interactive web component embedded on the landing page. The component
must adopt the existing landing-page color scheme — the same
`rgba(255,255,255,*)` on dark gradient background used by `t262-charts.js`,
`trend-chart.js`, and `perf-benchmark-chart.js`.

Currently the dependency graph is a static Markdown list. It doesn't
communicate the DAG shape (what blocks what, which issues are on the critical
path, what's unblocked vs deep in the chain) and it doesn't update as issues
land.

## Requirements

### Data source

The component reads from a generated JSON artifact produced at build time
(`build:pages`) by walking the `plan/issues/{ready,done,blocked,backlog}/`
directory and extracting each issue's frontmatter:

- `id` — node identifier
- `title` — node label
- `status` — `ready` | `blocked` | `done` | `backlog` | `wont-fix`
- `depends_on` — array of parent IDs
- `priority` — `critical` | `high` | `medium` | `low`
- `feasibility` — `easy` | `medium` | `hard`
- `sprint` — which sprint owns this

Artifact path: `assets/generated/dep-graph.json`. Build step writes it
before the pages build runs.

### Rendering

- **Layered DAG layout** (roots at the top, terminals at the bottom) — not
  force-directed. Use dagre or elkjs for layering; no heavy viz libraries
  like cytoscape.
- **Node shapes** encode status: rounded rectangle for ready, dashed outline
  for blocked, filled muted for done, faded for backlog, struck-through for
  wont-fix.
- **Node size** encodes priority (larger = higher priority).
- **Edges** are solid curved arrows from parent (prerequisite) to child
  (dependent). Use a subtle `rgba(255,255,255,0.3)` stroke; highlight
  on-path-to-hover at `rgba(255,255,255,0.9)`.
- **Hover** reveals the issue title, status, feasibility, sprint in a
  compact tooltip styled to match the existing tooltip conventions in
  `t262-charts.js`.
- **Click** opens the issue file on GitHub (or a Markdown viewer route if
  one exists).

### Color scheme (matches landing page)

Primary text + active edges: `rgba(255,255,255,1)` → `rgba(255,255,255,0.9)`
Secondary edges + idle nodes: `rgba(255,255,255,0.7)` → `rgba(255,255,255,0.3)`
Disabled / done / wont-fix: `rgba(255,255,255,0.2)`
Background: transparent — inherits page gradient.
Accent highlight (hover, critical path): use the same accent the trend chart
uses for its latest-point marker (check `trend-chart.js` for the exact value).

No additional colors. The whole site is monochrome-white-on-gradient; adding
red/green/yellow would break the aesthetic.

### Interactions

- **Filter bar** at the top: toggle sprint, status, priority.
- **Critical path highlight**: clicking a node highlights its full ancestor
  chain (prerequisites that must land first) and descendant chain (work
  this unblocks).
- **Sprint filter** defaults to "active sprints only" so the default view
  shows the current sprint's critical work.

### Component shape

Web component tag: `<dep-graph>`. Same pattern as the existing
`<t262-charts>`, `<trend-chart>`, `<perf-benchmark-chart>`. Lives under
`components/dep-graph.js`. Registered in the site nav via
`components/site-nav.js`.

### Responsiveness

- **Desktop**: wide layered layout, tooltip on hover.
- **Mobile** (<440px, matching the donut breakpoint): vertical scroll, tap
  for tooltip (no hover), filter bar collapses into a hamburger.

## Non-goals

- Force-directed or organic layouts — layered DAG only.
- Live updates from a running agent — the component reads the build artifact,
  not a websocket.
- Interactive editing — read-only visualization, not an issue editor.
- Integration with GitHub API — link-only.
- Large viz libraries (cytoscape, d3-force, sigma) — too heavy.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `scripts/build-dep-graph.ts` generates `assets/generated/dep-graph.json`
      from issue frontmatter
- [ ] `components/dep-graph.js` defines `<dep-graph>` web component
- [ ] Component renders the DAG with layered layout, node sizes by priority,
      node shapes by status
- [ ] Colors match the existing landing-page `rgba(255,255,255,*)` scheme
- [ ] Hover reveals tooltip; click opens issue file
- [ ] Filter bar works for sprint, status, priority
- [ ] Critical-path highlight on node click
- [ ] Mobile-responsive below 440px
- [ ] Embedded on landing page in an appropriate slot (new section or under
      the existing dependency-graph documentation link)
- [ ] Lighthouse perf score on landing page does not drop by more than 5
      points after adding the component

## Notes

- Layering library choice: **dagre** is the smallest footprint for layered
  layouts. elkjs is more flexible but larger. Pick dagre unless a layout
  edge case specifically needs elkjs.
- The build step should be idempotent and run in <1s on current issue count
  (~200 issues).
- Consider embedding the component in the existing `/plan` route as well,
  so the dep graph is also accessible from the plan-oriented views.
