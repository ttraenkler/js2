# #1090 — ToPrimitive "Cannot convert object to primitive value" (161 FAIL)

## Problem

161 test262 tests fail with "Cannot convert object to primitive value" or
related ToPrimitive errors. The error fires when an object is used in a
context that requires a primitive (string concatenation, comparison,
arithmetic) and the object's `[Symbol.toPrimitive]`, `valueOf`, or
`toString` methods are missing or non-callable.

Two sub-buckets:
- **111x** "Cannot convert object to primitive value" — the main
  ToPrimitive conversion path returns an object instead of a primitive,
  or throws too eagerly when the spec allows fallback
- **50x** "non-callable [Symbol.toPrimitive]" — test sets
  `Symbol.toPrimitive` to a non-function value and expects a TypeError
  with a specific message; our runtime either doesn't check or throws
  the wrong error

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§7.1.1 ToPrimitive](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-toprimitive) — invokes @@toPrimitive or falls back to OrdinaryToPrimitive
- [§7.1.1.1 OrdinaryToPrimitive](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ordinarytoprimitive) — tries valueOf/toString in order; throws TypeError if neither returns a non-object


## Root cause

The host runtime's `__to_primitive` helper (or equivalent coercion path
in `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts`) likely:
1. Doesn't walk the full ToPrimitive algorithm (try `[Symbol.toPrimitive]`
   → try `valueOf` → try `toString` → throw TypeError)
2. Doesn't handle the "hint" parameter (string vs number vs default)
3. Throws immediately on missing `valueOf` instead of falling through to
   `toString`

The codegen side in `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` may also emit incorrect
coercion sequences for binary operations where one operand is an object.

## Affected tests

- 111 tests with "Cannot convert object to primitive value"
- 50 tests with "non-callable [Symbol.toPrimitive]"
- Categories: language/expressions (majority), built-ins/Object, built-ins/Date

Example files (from test262-current.jsonl):
- `test/language/expressions/addition/coerce-symbol-to-prim.js`
- `test/language/expressions/equals/coerce-symbol-to-prim.js`
- `test/built-ins/Object/prototype/valueOf/non-callable-toprimitive.js`
- `test/built-ins/Date/prototype/Symbol.toPrimitive/called-as-function.js`
- `test/language/expressions/template-literal/coerce-symbol-to-prim.js`

## Proposed solution

1. Audit `src/runtime.ts` for the ToPrimitive host helper — ensure the full
   algorithm per ECMA-262 §7.1.1 is implemented with correct hint handling
2. Audit `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` for object-to-primitive coercion
   in binary operations — ensure the codegen emits the host call when an
   operand might be an object
3. Add a `[Symbol.toPrimitive]` callable check before invocation — throw
   TypeError if present but non-callable
4. Test: `npm test -- tests/issue-1090.test.ts` with 5-6 representative
   cases covering hint=string, hint=number, hint=default, non-callable
   Symbol.toPrimitive, and missing valueOf/toString fallback

## Effort estimate

**M** — the ToPrimitive algorithm itself is well-specified and bounded.
The complexity is in ensuring every codegen path that performs implicit
coercion (addition, comparison, template literals, property access) routes
through the correct host call. Expect ~100-150 LOC across runtime.ts +
type-coercion.ts + 1-2 codegen expression files.
