# Issue #223: Computed property names in class declarations

## Status: in-review
## Problem

88 compile errors from computed property names in class body declarations. TypeScript's checker rejects computed property names with non-simple-literal types, and our codegen skipped all computed property names in class members (property declarations, methods, getters/setters, static properties).

## Solution

Added `resolveClassMemberName()` helper in `index.ts` that resolves class member property names to static strings. Supports:
- Regular identifiers
- Private identifiers (#name)
- String literals
- Numeric literals
- Computed property names via `resolveComputedKeyExpression()` (string literals, const variable refs, enum members)

Updated all class member collection and compilation sites to use this helper instead of checking only `isIdentifier || isPrivateIdentifier`:
- `collectClassDeclaration`: property declarations, method declarations, getter/setter declarations, static properties
- `compileClassBodies`: field initializers, method bodies, getter/setter bodies

Dynamic computed names that cannot be resolved at compile time are silently skipped.

## Tests

- "class with string literal computed property name" - equivalence test
- "class with numeric literal computed property name" - equivalence test

## Files changed

- `src/codegen/index.ts` - `resolveClassMemberName()`, updated 8 member iteration sites
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` - exported `resolveComputedKeyExpression()`
- `tests/equivalence.test.ts` - 2 new tests
