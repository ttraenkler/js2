# #1068 — parser: 'await' not allowed as label identifier

## Problem

Running `#1034` prettier stress test against `node_modules/prettier/index.mjs`
(prettier 3.8.1 bundled ESM, ~19K lines) fails with exactly four diagnostics,
all of the same shape:

```
'await' is not allowed as a label identifier in this context
```

The compiler bails before emitting a binary. This is the **only** blocker for
compiling the full bundled prettier core module — once this parser rule is
relaxed (or the four sites are recognized as valid), the module reaches the
same codegen stage that `doc.mjs` already passes.

## Context

Prettier ships a pre-bundled ESM (`index.mjs`) where multiple source files
have been concatenated and transformed by rollup. In the concatenated output,
some local bindings named `await` land in statement positions that
TypeScript's parser classifies as "label identifier context," triggering an
unconditional diagnostic regardless of async/module status.

These are not real language errors — the original source files use `await`
legitimately as an identifier (pre-ES2017 variable names) or as a property
key that the rollup passthrough left as a bare identifier in a switch-case
chain. In module context, `await` is a reserved word for expressions but the
original prettier code predates this reservation, and bundling preserved the
identifier form.

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§13.13 Labelled Statements](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-labelled-statements) — LabelIdentifier must not be a reserved word
- [§12.1.1 Static Semantics: Early Errors — IdentifierReference](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-identifiers-static-semantics-early-errors) — `await` is a reserved word in async function contexts and module code


## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `prettier/index.mjs` compiles without the four `'await' is not allowed as a label identifier` diagnostics
- [ ] Parser rule aligned with ECMAScript: `await` is reserved only as a
      `LabelledStatement` label when the enclosing function is async, or at
      module top level. Outside those contexts it remains a valid identifier.
- [ ] No regression on `tests/test262.test.ts` for `language/statements/labelled/`

## Notes

- Surfaced by #1034 prettier stress run, 2026-04-11
- Report: `plan/log/issues/1034-report.md`
- Related to the TypeScript-checker-vs-codegen-reserved-word mismatch — we
  share TS's lexer, and the strict-module rule here is stricter than our
  codegen needs.
