# #894 -- test262 runner fails on macOS due to Linux assumptions and missing direct esbuild dependency

## Problem

The chunked `test:262` runner was developed against a Linux/container environment and was not portable to a native macOS workspace. On macOS it failed before meaningful test execution because of multiple environment assumptions:

1. `scripts/run-test262-vitest.sh` hardcoded `MAIN_DIR="/workspace"`.
2. The lock logic required `flock`, which is not present by default on macOS.
3. The script assumed Linux-only memory-monitor tools (`free`, `/proc`).
4. `git worktree add` was blocked in the local sandbox, with no fallback path.
5. The script invoked `esbuild` directly but the repo only depended on it transitively via `vite`, so a local install could have a valid lockfile entry but no root-linked executable.

This made the runner look broken on macOS even before actual compiler/runtime test failures could be observed.

## Fix approach

1. Add `esbuild` as an explicit `devDependency` and commit the lockfile update.
2. Record approved build scripts in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` so the native install is reproducible.
3. Make `scripts/run-test262-vitest.sh` portable:
   - derive repo root from the script location instead of `/workspace`
   - fall back to a PID/mkdir lock when `flock` is unavailable
   - skip the Linux-only memory monitor on unsupported platforms
   - fall back to the current workspace when `git worktree add` is unavailable
   - resolve `esbuild` from PATH, `node_modules/.bin`, or the pnpm store

## Acceptance criteria

- `pnpm run test:262` starts successfully on macOS
- compiler/runtime bundles build via local `esbuild`
- no hard dependency on Linux-only tooling for basic execution

## Test Results

- Native macOS reinstall completed with working `esbuild` postinstall
- `pnpm run test:262` successfully launched and completed a full run after the portability fixes
- Merged in commit `bd26b5f5`
