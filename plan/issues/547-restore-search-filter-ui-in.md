# Issue #547: Restore search/filter UI in report.html

The filter UI was lost when conformance-report.html was merged into report.html. Add back:

- Text search box to filter categories by name
- Status toggle cards (pass/fail/CE/skip) to filter by status
- Click-to-expand category rows showing individual test results (already present)

## Key files
- `benchmarks/report.html`
