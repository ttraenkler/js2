# Issue #558: Performance -- add hash-based function type deduplication

## Problem

`addFuncType` in `src/codegen/index.ts` performs a linear scan over all existing
function types to find duplicates. With 100+ function types in a typical module,
this O(n^2) behavior is measurable during codegen.

## Solution

Replace the linear scan with a `Map<string, number>` cache keyed on a canonical
string representation of the function type signature (param kinds + result kinds,
including typeIdx for ref/ref_null types).

## Implementation Summary

**What was done:**
- Added `funcTypeCache: Map<string, number>` field to `CodegenContext` interface
- Initialized the cache in both `generateModule` and `generateMultiModule`
- Created `funcTypeKey()` helper that builds a canonical string key from params and results
- Replaced the O(n) linear scan in `addFuncType` with O(1) Map lookup

**Key design decisions:**
- Key format: `"kind1,kind2:typeIdx|kind3"` where `|` separates params from results
  and `:typeIdx` is appended only for ref/ref_null types
- The cache is populated on insert and checked before any type array access

**Files changed:**
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- CodegenContext interface, generateModule, generateMultiModule, addFuncType

**Tests:** All existing tests pass (pre-existing failures unrelated to this change).
