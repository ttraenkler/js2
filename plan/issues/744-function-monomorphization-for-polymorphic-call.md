# #744 -- Function monomorphization for polymorphic call sites

## Status: open

## Problem

When whole-program type flow (`#743`) detects that a function is called with
different type signatures at different call sites, it must widen to
`externref`. This loses type information even though each individual call site
still has known types.

```javascript
function identity(x) { return x; }
identity(42);      // wants f64
identity("hello"); // wants externref (string)
```

Without monomorphization, `x` becomes generic everywhere.

Issue `#1124` now makes the architectural implication explicit: this kind of
call-site-sensitive cloning belongs in the new middle-end layer, not as another
ad hoc extension of direct AST-to-Wasm lowering.

## Approach

### When to monomorphize

After whole-program analysis (`#743`) and within the middle-end direction from
`#1124`, identify functions where:

1. parameter types conflict across call sites and would otherwise widen
2. each individual call site still has a concrete type signature
3. the function body is small enough that duplication is worthwhile

### How

For each distinct type signature observed at call sites:

1. clone the function body
2. compile with concrete parameter types
3. name it `$funcName$mono_f64_f64` or similar
4. at each call site, emit a call to the matching specialization

### Example

```javascript
function square(x) { return x * x; }
square(3);     // -> call $square$mono_f64
square(3n);    // -> call $square$mono_i64
```

Two function copies, each using native Wasm arithmetic and no generic value
plumbing.

### Limits

- do not monomorphize for already-generic `externref` call sites
- cap at N specializations per function to avoid code bloat
- recursive functions should monomorphize the entry specialization and keep
  recursive calls within the same specialization when possible

### Code size trade-off

Monomorphization increases binary size. Mitigate with:

- only monomorphizing small functions
- later deduplication opportunities for identical bodies
- preferring tagged-union or generic fallback strategies for large functions

## Complexity

## Notes

- Depends on `#743` for whole-program type flow
- Depends on `#1124` for the middle-end and call-site metadata architecture
- `#773` covers the simpler monomorphic-by-observation case; this issue is the
  explicit cloned-specialization path for truly polymorphic call sites
