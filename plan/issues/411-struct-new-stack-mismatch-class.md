# #411 -- struct.new stack mismatch: class/object construction emits wrong argument count

## Status: ready

114 tests fail with "not enough arguments on the stack for struct.new" (down from 517 after partial fixes). The compiler emits a `struct.new` instruction but pushes fewer values than the struct type requires.

## Root cause

When compiling `new ClassName()` or object literals, the codegen must push exactly one value per struct field before emitting `struct.new`. Mismatches occur when:
- Class has inherited fields that are not accounted for in the constructor emission
- Default field initializers are not emitted as stack values
- Object literals with optional/missing properties do not push defaults for absent fields
- Computed property names change the field layout at compile time

## Example failures

- `test/language/expressions/class/accessor-name-inst/computed.js` -- class with computed accessor
- `test/language/expressions/class/elements/fields-string-name-static-propname-constructor.js`
- `test/language/expressions/object/accessor-name-computed.js`

## Relationship to prior work

#401 (done) fixed some struct.new mismatches but focused on call argument counts. This issue covers the remaining 517 cases specific to struct field count mismatches during object/class construction.

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `struct.new` always receives exactly the number of arguments matching the struct definition
- [ ] Inherited fields are included in the argument count
- [ ] Missing object literal properties emit default values (null/0/NaN)
- [ ] CE count for "struct.new" stack mismatch reduced by at least 75%
