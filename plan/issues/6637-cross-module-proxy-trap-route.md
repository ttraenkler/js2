# #6637 — untyped-receiver Proxy property access misroutes to "null or undefined" (S53 fix, #5383 stack)

## Origin

Dispatched as the S52c slice of #5383 (standalone Temporal). S52 diagnosed a
PROVIDER-side callable-classification gap; S52b implemented the prescribed
fix (a reverse-peer "is this externref callable" channel) and confirmed it
does not fix the empty-handler-Proxy repro, then found "the empty-handler GET
case is the load-bearing result" — no trap exists to misclassify, so S52's
diagnosis could not be the cause of `NS.readOverflow(new Proxy({overflow:1},
{}))` throwing across a standalone link. S52c was dispatched to find the real
cause under a "cross-module struct field layout" hypothesis.

## The corrected diagnosis: this is NOT a cross-module or struct-layout bug

**The leading hypothesis in scope (a `$Proxy`/`$ProxyTraps` field-order
mismatch between the two modules' canonical types) is falsified.** Every
piece of direct evidence contradicts it:

1. **The struct shapes are byte-identical.** Decompiled both binaries
   (`wasm-dis -all`, never wabt) and diffed the `$Proxy` (7 fields:
   `ptag`/`ptarget`/`phandler`/`ptraps`/`revoked`/`callable`/`constructible`)
   and `$ProxyTraps` (13 externref fields, `get`(0)…`construct`(12)) type
   declarations side by side — field count, field types, field ORDER all
   match. The field index constants (`TRAP_GET=0`, `F_PTARGET=1`, …) are
   literal numeric constants in `object-runtime-proxy.ts`'s source, baked
   identically on every compile — there is no registration-order dependency
   to diverge.
2. **`ref.cast $Proxy` genuinely succeeds in the provider** — confirmed by
   reading `__proxy_get_dispatch`'s own compiled body (`struct.get $19 4`
   [revoked], `struct.get $19 3` [ptraps], `struct.get $18 0` [get trap] —
   all correctly-indexed reads on the RIGHT canonical types). A failed
   canonical-type match would trap the whole cast, not silently misread one
   field.
3. **The bug reproduces through a PLAIN, minimal, single-argument, direct
   `call` to a top-level exported function — no `__apply_closure`/
   `__js2wasm_link_method_call` vec-args bridge involved at all.**
   `export function readOverflowDirect(o) { return o.overflow; }`, called as
   `readOverflowDirect(proxy)`, throws identically to `NS.readOverflow(proxy)`
   — ruling out S52b's own "peer-owned closure hijacks `__apply_closure`"
   mechanism (#5383 S41/#6628) as the cause here; that mechanism is real but
   is not THIS defect.
4. **Plain (non-Proxy) objects cross the exact same boundary correctly.**
   `hasOverflowDirect({overflow:1})`, `isExtDirect({overflow:1})`,
   `keysDirect({overflow:1})` (all `("overflow" in o)` / `isExtensible` /
   `Object.keys(o).length` style reads on a crossed `$Object`) all answer
   correctly (`1`/`1`/`1`). Only Proxy receivers misbehave.
5. **The decisive test: the SAME defect reproduces in a SINGLE STANDALONE
   MODULE with NO link, NO second instance, NO cross-module call at all.**
   ```ts
   function readOverflow(o) { return o.overflow; }   // untyped param — "any"
   export function readViaUntypedFn() {
     const options = new Proxy({ overflow: 1 }, {});
     try { return readOverflow(options) === 1 ? 1 : 2; }
     catch (e) { return -1; }               // → -1 (THROWS)
   }
   export function readViaKnownType() {
     const options = new Proxy({ overflow: 1 }, {});
     try { return options.overflow === 1 ? 1 : 2; }
     catch (e) { return -1; }               // → 1 (correct)
   }
   ```
   Both functions do the identical `.overflow` read on the identical
   `new Proxy({overflow:1}, {})` value, in the same module. The only
   difference is whether the receiver's static type is known (`options`,
   locally declared, TS infers `Proxy<...>`) vs unknown ("any" — `o` is an
   UNTYPED function parameter, exactly the shape every provider function's
   parameter has, since the link stub declares it as `any`). `readViaProxy`/
   `readViaEmptyProxyCross` etc. in the original repro only "looked"
   cross-module-specific because **every provider function parameter is
   necessarily untyped** — the real trigger is the untyped/"any" receiver,
   not the module boundary.

**Conclusion: `NS.readOverflow(proxy)`'s repro is an instance of a general,
single-module, standalone defect — dynamic ("any"-typed) property access on a
value that turns out to be a `Proxy` at runtime throws `TypeError: Cannot
access property on null or undefined`, instead of correctly dispatching
through the Proxy's trap machinery. The cross-module framing in #5383 S52/S52b
was a coincidence of where the untyped receiver came from, not the cause.**

## Root cause (traced to source)

`e.message.charCodeAt(i)`-decoded the actual thrown message (native strings
can't be `console.log`'d directly in standalone — decode via `.charCodeAt`,
not `wasm-dis`/host tricks) for the single-module repro's throw:

```
"Cannot access property on null or undefined at 2:50"
```

This is `typeErrorThrowInstrs`'s compile-time-baked message
(`src/codegen/property-access.ts` ~1398), and `diagNullCheck(o)` — a provider
probe doing `if (o === null) return 1; …` on the raw Proxy argument BEFORE any
property read — answers `1`: **the compiled code treats the live, non-null,
correctly-typed `$Proxy` receiver as if `===null`.** A companion probe
(`localNullCheckOfProxy`, same `===null` test on the SAME just-constructed
`options` value, no crossing) answers `3` ("genuinely not null") — so the
value is fine right up until the untyped-receiver dot-access runs its guard.

`emitNullGuardedStructGet` (`src/codegen/property-access.ts` ~1656) explains
the mechanism: for a member read where the compiler has a `propName` but no
certain static struct type for the receiver, it does a **guarded cast to some
assumed static struct type** (`emitGuardedRefCast`, `src/codegen/
type-coercion.ts` ~53) and then "multi-struct dispatch": try the primary
struct, then try every OTHER statically-known struct type that happens to
have a field literally named `overflow`. A `Proxy`'s properties are never
static struct fields — they resolve dynamically via `[[Get]]`/traps — so this
by-field-name struct search can never find `$Proxy`, the guarded cast fails
(produces `ref.null`), and `emitNullCheckThrow` (~1461) treats that failed
cast as "the receiver is null" and throws, instead of falling through to the
GENERIC dynamic path (`__extern_get`, which correctly recognizes `$Proxy` via
its own `ref.test` front-guard — confirmed working for `known-type` receivers
and for plain-`$Object` receivers in every control above).

The remaining trap/target-forward split observed in the original run (get/
set/delete THROW; has/isExtensible/`Object.keys` return silently-wrong
`0`/`0`/`0` instead of the correct `1`/`1`/`1`) is a SEPARATE downstream
consequence, not a separate defect: dot/bracket `[[Get]]`/`[[Set]]`/`delete`
compile through this same STATIC guarded-struct-cast+`emitNullCheckThrow`
path (property-access.ts), which throws on a struct-shape miss; `in`/
`Object.isExtensible`/`Object.keys` compile through the GENERIC dynamic
helpers (`__extern_has`/`__object_isExtensible`/`__object_keys`), which DO
correctly `ref.test $Proxy` and correctly recognize the trap-absent case —
their own miswiring (answering `0` instead of forwarding to the real target)
is a second, smaller, separate bug in that generic path, not investigated
further this session (lower priority: it does not throw, and it is reachable
only once the primary defect above is fixed for those receivers too, since
they were never gated by the guarded-cast throw in the first place — WAIT,
they already bypass it and already answer wrong on today's `main` equivalent,
independent of #6637's throw path; see "What's still open" below).

## What was implemented (this branch)

Nothing shipped. **S52b's WIP terminals were reverted** (`localCallableKind`/
`reverseCallableKind`/`localApply`/`reverseApply` in
`standalone-link-reverse-peer.ts`, plus the `__typeof_function` reverse
fallback arm in `typeof-natives-finalize.ts`) — they target a callable-
classification gap that this session's evidence shows is not implicated in
the empty-handler repro at all (no trap closure exists to misclassify, and
the defect reproduces identically with zero linking). Keeping unused,
untested cross-module plumbing in the tree pending a defect it does not fix
is not warranted; `git revert --no-edit HEAD` cleanly removed exactly S52b's
diff (`git diff 0bb08d20a0..HEAD -- src/codegen/standalone-link-reverse-peer.ts
src/codegen/typeof-natives-finalize.ts` is empty after the revert).

A fix for the REAL defect (untyped-receiver dot-access on a Proxy) was
**not** attempted this session. It is a different, larger-blast-radius change
than what was scoped for S52c: `emitNullGuardedStructGet`/
`emitGuardedRefCast`/`emitNullCheckThrow` are the generic machinery behind
EVERY "any"-typed property read in the compiler (not Proxy-specific), so a
fix has to reason about every other struct-shaped runtime value (open
`$Object` bags, class instances, Map/Set/RegExp carriers, wrapper primitives,
…) that ALSO reaches this path via an untyped receiver, to make sure a
"guarded cast failed — fall through to the dynamic path instead of throwing"
change does not regress an existing, deliberate "receiver really is the wrong
shape, throw" case elsewhere. That needs its own architect-level design pass,
not a same-session patch.

## What's still open

1. **The fix itself.** Likely shape: when `emitGuardedRefCast`'s cast fails
   AND the receiver's declared/inferred type is "any" (not proven to be one
   of the specific static struct candidates), `emitNullGuardedStructGet`
   should fall through to the GENERIC dynamic property-read helper
   (`__extern_get`/`__extern_set`/`__delete_property`, which already handle
   `$Proxy` correctly via `ref.test` front-guards) instead of treating the
   failed cast as null. Needs an architect pass on blast radius: which of the
   "multi-struct dispatch by field name" call sites are meant to be
   EXHAUSTIVE static resolution (legitimately throw on a genuine shape miss)
   vs. which are a FAST PATH over a truly dynamic ("any") receiver that
   should fall through to `__extern_get` on any miss, not just a
   `$Proxy`-shaped one.
2. **The has/isExtensible/`Object.keys` silent-wrong-value bug**, confirmed
   present and REACHABLE INDEPENDENTLY of #1 (their code path never goes
   through the guarded-cast throw at all — they already answer wrong on
   today's tree). Root cause not traced this session; worth its own
   diagnosis pass once #1 is understood, since it may turn out to share a
   root cause with #1 (something about `ptarget` forwarding through the
   Proxy dispatch's trap-absent arm) or be fully independent.
3. **Re-run the original 10 sample-row list** once #1 lands — not attempted
   this session, since the fix wasn't attempted.
4. **`localApply`/`reverseApply`/`localCallableKind`/`reverseCallableKind`
   terminals**: S52b's WIP, now reverted. May still be independently useful
   for #5383's callable-classification gap (S52's original diagnosis, which
   remains true for the REAL-trap case — `readViaProxy` in the original repro,
   which has an actual `get(t,k,r){...}` closure and threw "Proxy get trap is
   not callable", a message this session did NOT re-derive or re-examine).
   Re-implement from scratch if/when that specific gap is revisited; do not
   resurrect this branch's reverted commit as-is without re-verifying it
   against whatever #1's fix changes in `__typeof_function`'s arm ladder.

## Verification (this session)

Three gitignored probe files (project convention — ad-hoc repro/debug files
go in `.tmp/`, not `tests/`), preserved for the next agent at
`.tmp/s52c/probe-6637-{repro,direct,single-module}.test.ts` in this worktree
(`/home/user/js2/.claude/worktrees/agent-ad93bfa729a45909f`):

- `probe-6637-repro.test.ts` — the original S52b two-module `NS.readOverflow`
  harness, extended with empty-handler LOCAL vs CROSS variants and `in`/
  `isExtensible` controls.
- `probe-6637-direct.test.ts` — the direct-top-level-function-import
  bisection (rules out the `__apply_closure`/methodCall vec-args bridge);
  10 read/has/set/delete/isExt/keys probes, plain-object controls, and the
  `charCodeAt` message-decode diagnostic that found "Cannot access property
  on null or undefined at 2:50" and `diagNullCheck`'s `=== null` confirmation.
- `probe-6637-single-module.test.ts` — the DECISIVE single-module (no link at
  all) repro: `readViaUntypedFn` (`-1`, throws) vs `readViaKnownType` (`1`,
  correct), both reading `.overflow` off the identical `new Proxy({overflow:1},
  {})` value.

No `tests/issue-6637-*.test.ts` witness suite was written — writing a
permanent witness for a defect whose fix location is not yet chosen (see
"What's still open" #1) would need to be rewritten once the architect design
lands; the three probes above are the reproducible evidence trail instead.
Base-vs-fix comparison, the four-family battery, the must-not-move A-F
battery, byte-flip tables, and equivalence-gate numbers were **not run** —
there is no fix on this branch to compare against a base.

## Recommendation

1. **Do not dispatch another "cross-module Proxy" slice against #6637 as
   scoped.** The cross-module framing is retired by the evidence above; the
   next slice should be scoped as "standalone: dynamic property access on a
   Proxy through an untyped receiver" and should NOT require any link/
   provider/consumer harness to reproduce or verify.
2. **Route through an architect pass first** for the blast-radius question
   in "What's still open" #1 before implementation — this touches the
   general "any"-typed member-access fast path, not a Proxy-specific
   function.
3. Keep the has/isExtensible/`Object.keys` silent-wrong-value finding (#2
   above) as a candidate follow-up issue once the primary fix's shape is
   known — it may or may not share a fix.

## Implementation notes / commits (S52c branch, superseded below)

- `git revert --no-edit HEAD` (reverts S52b's `9f7e38ac1e` WIP commit
  cleanly) — `src/codegen/standalone-link-reverse-peer.ts`,
  `src/codegen/typeof-natives-finalize.ts` restored to their pre-S52b state.
- This issue file rewritten with the corrected diagnosis (this commit).
- No `src/` changes beyond the revert.

## S53 fix (2026-09-18) — the real mechanism was NOT `emitNullGuardedStructGet`'s multi-struct dispatch

S52c's own diagnosis (above) named `emitNullGuardedStructGet`/
`emitGuardedRefCast` (`src/codegen/property-access.ts` /
`type-coercion.ts`) as the fix location — "the guarded cast fails, finds no
alternate struct with a field named `overflow`, and `emitNullCheckThrow`
treats the failed cast as null instead of falling through to the dynamic
path." **That is not what happens.** Tracing the compiled WAT for the
single-module repro (`.tmp/s53/repro.dis.wat`, `wasm-dis -all`, decisive
evidence below) shows the multi-struct dispatch chain is never even reached
for this repro: `.overflow` on an untyped receiver already lowers to the
GENERIC dynamic helper (`__dyn_member_get`, `src/codegen/dyn-read.ts`, the
#3053 unified reader), which already `ref.test`s `$Proxy` correctly — this
part of S52c's diagnosis was accurate in spirit (the generic path handles
Proxy) but wrong about which mechanism the repro actually exercises.

**The real defect is one level up, at the Proxy's OWN variable declaration.**
`new Proxy(target, handler)` is typed by TypeScript's own `lib.es5.d.ts` as
its TARGET's type (`ProxyConstructor`'s `new <T>(target: T, handler:
ProxyHandler<T>): T`), so the checker sees `const options = new Proxy({
overflow: 1 }, {})` as `{ overflow: number }`. `src/codegen/analysis/
proxy-binding-escape.ts` (`proxyBindingNeedsExternref` /
`proxyBindingEscapesToCall`, added by #2615 and narrowed by #2615's own
merge_group regression fix — see that issue's "NARROWING" section) exists
precisely to override this: it forces `options`'s WASM local to the raw
externref Proxy carrier instead of the checker-fictional struct, UNLESS the
binding "escapes" into a call/`new` argument, in which case #2615 keeps the
struct typing (that narrowing was needed to keep
`Object.prototype.toString.call(p)` / `Array.prototype.copyWithin.call(p,
…)` / `Object.getPrototypeOf(p)` working on the merged main at the time).

`readOverflow(options)` — passing the Proxy binding as a plain call argument
— trips exactly that "escapes to a call" rule, so `options`'s local gets
struct-typed to WHATEVER WasmGC struct matches `{ overflow: number }`'s
shape (confirmed by `wasm-dis`: local `$0`'s declared type is `(ref null
$25)`, `$25 = struct (field (mut f64))`, vs. the ACTUAL runtime value's type
`$14 = $Proxy`, a 7-field struct — completely different shapes). At `const
options = new Proxy(...)`'s own codegen, `emitGuardedRefCast` casts the
freshly-created Proxy to `$25`; the cast ALWAYS fails (a `$Proxy` struct can
never match a 1-field `struct(mut f64)`), so `options`'s local becomes
`ref.null` **at the point of declaration** — before `readOverflow` is ever
called. Every later dynamic read of `options` (`__dyn_member_get`'s own
null/undefined guard, `__carrier_recv_to_extern`) then correctly reports
"receiver is null or undefined", because by that point it genuinely is: the
Proxy value was discarded three statements earlier. The control
(`options.overflow`, a DIRECT property read with no untyped-function
indirection) never trips `proxyBindingEscapesToCall` at all, so `options`
keeps its externref storage and the read is correct — which is exactly the
single-module bisection S52c ran, just misattributed to the wrong mechanism.

### The fix

`src/codegen/analysis/proxy-binding-escape.ts`'s `expressionIsEscapingArgument`
now declines to treat a plain call `f(...)` as an escape when `f` is a BARE
IDENTIFIER (never a property access — so `.call`/`.apply`/method receivers,
the #2615 regression class, are structurally excluded) and the matching
parameter carries NO type annotation (`ctx.oracle.signatureOf(f).params[i]`
answers the oracle's `{kind:"any"}` fact — genuine implicit-any, checked via
the type oracle per this repo's `ctx.oracle`-not-raw-checker rule, so this
adds zero raw `checker.*` usage — confirmed by `check:oracle-ratchet`
reporting +0/+0). New helper `calleeParamIsUntyped` implements the check;
`expressionIsEscapingArgument`/`proxyBindingEscapesToCall` gained a `ctx`
parameter to reach the oracle (their sole caller already had one).

An untyped parameter reads its argument through the SAME generic dynamic
path (`__dyn_member_get`/`__extern_get`) the working direct-read control
uses, so passing the raw Proxy externref into it is always safe — there is
no typed-struct expectation to violate. `.call`/`.apply`/method-receiver
calls (`Object.prototype.toString.call(p)`, `Array.prototype.copyWithin.call
(p,…)`, `Object.getPrototypeOf(p)`) all have a `PropertyAccessExpression`
callee, not a bare identifier, so they are unaffected by construction — the
`ts.isIdentifier(parent.expression)` guard in `calleeParamIsUntyped` is the
line that keeps #2615's fix intact. Verified directly with a control test
(`a Proxy binding escaping to a TYPED (non-any) call keeps working (#2615
class unaffected)` in the witness suite below, plus manual confirmation that
`Object.getPrototypeOf` was ALREADY on the pre-existing `consumesExternrefCarrier`
allowlist and is untouched either way).

### Verification

Witness suite: `tests/issue-6637-untyped-receiver-proxy-property-access.test.ts`
(13 tests) — single-module untyped read (empty-handler + real get trap),
write (real set trap), `in` (has trap), `Object.keys` (ownKeys trap),
`Object.isExtensible` (empty-handler forward), controls (null receiver still
throws; plain object/class instance/array receivers unaffected;
statically-typed direct Proxy read unaffected; a Proxy binding escaping to a
TYPED call — `Object.getPrototypeOf` — unaffected), and one two-module
control (a linked provider's untyped parameter reading a consumer-built
Proxy). File-copy A/B against `git show HEAD~:src/codegen/analysis/
proxy-binding-escape.ts` (captured to `.tmp/s53/base/proxy-binding-escape.ts.base`
at first edit): **5 of 13 fail on base** (the exact fix-witness cases: read
empty-handler, read get-trap, write set-trap, `Object.keys` ownKeys-trap, and
the two-module control), **all 13 pass on fix**; 8 controls pass on BOTH
trees, confirming they are genuinely unaffected. Two originally-planned cases
(calling a method through ANY Proxy — `proxy.m()` — and an `isExtensible`
TRAP specifically) were found to throw even in the fully static, non-#6637
direct case on both trees (`.tmp/s53/debug-call3.mjs`, `.tmp/s53/debug-isext2.mjs`)
— pre-existing, separate gaps, out of this fix's scope, noted in the
witness file and left for a follow-up filing.

`node scripts/pre-dispatch-gate.mjs 6637`-equivalent hand check + full gate
chain: `npm run -s typecheck` clean; `check-loc-budget`/`check-func-budget`
green both against `merge-base(origin)` and against `origin/main` directly
(`LOC_GATE_BASE=<origin/main sha>`) EXCEPT the pre-existing, unrelated
`emitObjectProtoToStringClassifier` ceiling drift noted in this file's
`func-budget-allow` frontmatter (main moved the ceiling in `0bf2914353`, a
refactor this stack predates; this PR does not touch that function);
`check-coercion-sites`/`check:oracle-ratchet`/`check:dead-exports`/
`check:speculative-rollback`/`check:issue-ids:against-main` all green.
Required suite `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 tests/issue-66*.test.ts
tests/issue-6484-*.test.ts` — **38 files / 240 tests, 0 failed** (227 prior
+ 13 new from this fix's witness file).

See `### S53 findings` in `#5383`'s own issue file and the "Stack state
2026-09-18 (post-S53)" section of the temporal-standalone handover for the
cross-file summary (four-family/A–F/corpus-byte battery status, criterion-4
verdict).

### S53b/S53b2 follow-up — criterion-4 battery run against the real Temporal
provider (2026-09-18)

S53 above left the criterion-4 battery (10 named sample rows, four-family,
A–F must-not-move, corpus-byte) unmeasured. S53b/S53b2 (measurement-only,
`#5383`'s issue file, no `src/` changes) ran it against this fix's HEAD.
**Answering S53's own follow-up question** ("the fix should also move some
of #6628's rows — worth checking first"): confirmed it does **not** — none
of the 10 sampled rows move, and the fix's escape-narrowing shape (Proxy
binding passed to an untyped function parameter) simply does not occur
anywhere in the four-family or A–F corpora.

**10 target rows** — all still fail with the same error strings as S51/S53:

| Row | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `Duration/from/order-of-operations.js` | fail — `TypeError: Proxy get trap is not callable` |
| `PlainDate/from/order-of-operations.js` | fail — `TypeError: Proxy get trap is not callable` |
| `PlainDate/from/observable-get-overflow-argument-primitive.js` | fail — `TypeError: Proxy get trap is not callable` |
| `PlainDateTime/from/order-of-operations.js` | fail — `TypeError: Proxy get trap is not callable` |
| `PlainDateTime/from/observable-get-overflow-argument-primitive.js` | fail — `TypeError: Proxy get trap is not callable` |
| `ZonedDateTime/prototype/add/order-of-operations.js` | fail — `TypeError: Proxy get trap is not callable` |
| `Duration/compare/options-read-before-algorithmic-validation.js` | fail — `Test262Error: … Expected a RangeError but got a undefined` |
| `PlainDate/from/options-read-before-algorithmic-validation.js` | fail — `Test262Error: … Expected a RangeError but got a undefined` |
| `PlainDateTime/from/options-read-before-algorithmic-validation.js` | fail — `Test262Error: … Expected a RangeError but got a undefined` |
| `ZonedDateTime/prototype/add/options-read-before-algorithmic-validation.js` | fail — `Test262Error: … Expected a RangeError but got a undefined` |

The 6 "order-of-operations" rows hit a REAL-trap Proxy path (a still-open,
deeper #6628 mechanism this fix does not touch). The 4 "options-read-before-
algorithmic-validation" rows fail identically to S51's own finding: the
caught value genuinely is a `TypeError` from #6628's mechanism, correctly
failing `assert.throws(RangeError, …)`.

**Corpus-byte battery**: 42 files × {gc, standalone} = 84 rows, `statusFlips=0
shaFlips=0` — not even a byte changed in any compiled binary (S53b, complete
before the restart).

**Equivalence gate**: 22 failing / 1720 passing / 22 known-failures, no new
regressions — unchanged from S50/S51/S53 (S53b2, re-run against the final
HEAD after the A–F battery completed).

**Criterion-4 verdict**: all four sub-batteries measured, zero movement in
every one. S53's fix is criterion-4-clean.

### S63 (2026-09-19, senior-dev, branch `issue-5383-standalone-temporal-s63`)

**Fixed. 9 of the 10 target rows flipped on the first cut, the 10th on the
second; per-family diffs show 0 pass→fail anywhere.**

#### The decisive probe (do this one first if you ever revisit the area)

`.tmp/s63/probe1.mts` — a two-module linked pair (`compileProject` provider +
`compileMulti` consumer, `--target standalone`, `hostBridge: "off"`), where the
PROVIDER exports a diagnostic `checkCallable(f) { return typeof f ===
"function" ? 1 : 0 }` alongside the ordinary `readOverflow(o) { return
o.overflow }`. On the S62 base (`.tmp/s63/probe1.out`):

| probe | base | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `checkCallable(namedConsumerFn)` | **0** | the provider cannot classify a consumer closure |
| `checkCallable(consumerArrowFn)` | **0** | …not a shape effect: arrows too |
| `checkCallable({a:1})` | 0 | control, correctly not callable |
| `readPlain({overflow:7})` | 7 | the #5383 S17 reverse channel IS live |
| consumer-local `proxy.overflow` | 7 | the consumer's own dispatch is fine |
| `readOverflow(consumerProxy)` | throws `Proxy get trap is not callable` | the symptom |

**Root cause, in one line:** the provider's `__typeof_function` classifies
callables by `ref.test`ing the closure wrapper types IT registered, so it
answers 0 for every consumer-owned closure; `__proxy_get_dispatch` reads the
trap out of the foreign `$Proxy`'s `ptraps` field, asks that classifier, and
throws. S52's original diagnosis was right about the gap; S52b/S55's fix
DIRECTION was the problem.

#### Why not S52b/S55's reverse-peer `callableKind`/`apply` terminals

S55 proved that channel classifies a bare cross-module closure correctly
end-to-end and STILL could not run a trap. That is not a wiring bug to chase:
invoking a closure also needs the owner's `this` binding, its own
`__apply_closure` arity ladder and its own argument carriers. Classification
was never sufficient. Those terminals are **not** in this fix; commit
`751ceea68e` stays unmerged.

#### The fix — delegate the operation, do not import the capability

On the ONE path that throws today (the get-trap callable guard in
`ensureProxyRuntime`, `src/codegen/object-runtime-proxy.ts`), hand the WHOLE
`[[Get]]` back to the module that owns the Proxy, over the reverse channel that
already exists. The consumer re-performs `proxy[key]` with its own dispatch,
its own trap and its own closure call, and returns the value as an externref.

Placement is the entire safety argument: every receiver whose trap the provider
CAN call is decided before the arm exists, so the arm cannot change a working
answer — only replace a throw. No peer installed (every gc build, every
single-module standalone build, every provider whose consumer is JS) ⇒ the hop
index is undefined ⇒ **zero bytes emitted**. Locals are reused (`res`), so no
dispatch function grows one.

**Second commit: the delegation needed its own RAW terminal.** Routing through
the existing `localGet` terminal fixed 9 rows and left
`Duration/compare/options-read-before-algorithmic-validation.js` failing,
because `localGet` normalises an `undefined` value to `null` ("not mine") — and
the provider then re-derives the answer through `localIsNull`, i.e. a SECOND
and THIRD observable trap invocation, which the order-asserting rows count.
`__js2wasm_link_local_proxy_get` / `__js2wasm_link_reverse_proxy_get` return
`__extern_get` verbatim (install ABI grows one funcref). `undefined` then
crosses as the boxed-NaN undefined carrier — a canonical, structurally shared
type, so the provider's own `__extern_is_undefined` recognises the consumer's.
Only a trap that genuinely returns `null` stays ambiguous with "not mine", and
that case keeps the pre-existing throw rather than a fabricated value.

#### Results

Ten target rows, `--target standalone`, real @js-temporal provider
(`.tmp/s63/rows-1.tsv` first cut, `.tmp/s63/rows-2.tsv` final): **10/10 pass**,
from 10/10 fail on the S62 base.

Four-family battery vs the S62 base TSVs (per-file diff, not totals):

| Family | Base | S63 | pass→fail | fail→pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PlainDate | 113/120 | 116/120 | 0 | 3 |
| Duration | 106/120 | 108/120 | 0 | 2 |
| PlainDateTime | 113/120 | 116/120 | 0 | 3 |
| ZonedDateTime | 115/120 | 117/120 | 0 | 2 |
| **Total** | **447/480** | **457/480** | **0** | **10** |

A–F must-not-move battery: 0 pass→fail in every group, including the two
Proxy+Reflect groups E-unlinked and E-linked. Corpus byte A/B (42 files ×
{gc, standalone}): `statusFlips=0 shaFlips=0` over all 84 rows — the gc lane is
byte-identical and so is every single-module standalone compile; the only
artifact that moves is the linked PROVIDER binary, **3,334,248 → 3,334,356 B
(+108)**. Equivalence gate: 22 failing / 1720 passing / 22 known-failures, no
new regressions.

#### Witness

`tests/issue-6637-link-proxy-trap-invocation.test.ts`, 13 assertions across two
linked pairs (host-free, empty import object). Teeth: object-literal trap,
named-function trap, one trap call per read, trap sees target/key/receiver,
return value forwarded, undefined result survives in ONE call, a throwing trap
propagates its RangeError. Controls (same answer on both trees): a genuinely
non-callable trap still throws TypeError, a consumer-local Proxy read, a plain
bag read, `in` through an empty handler, an empty-handler read. File-copy
revert-and-measure against `d38e8c52c9`: the fix `it` fails on base at its
first assertion (the guard's TypeError escapes as a raw wasm exception) and
passes whole on the fix; the residual `it` below passes on BOTH trees.

#### Residual found while writing the witness — #6628's class, not fixed here

Bisected with `.tmp/s63/probe4.mts`: **a provider that compiles a Proxy of its
OWN bypasses this fix entirely.** Compiling one registers a closure wrapper
type in the provider; a consumer trap closure of matching shape then passes the
provider's `ref.test` callable ladder, `__typeof_function` answers "callable",
the guard this fix hangs off never fires, and the provider tries to run a
foreign closure through its own `__apply_closure` — which runs nothing and
answers `undefined`. Measured: the identical probe answers 15 (all identity
bits set) with a plain provider and 0 with a provider that owns one Proxy.

That is the older, wider #6628 foreign-closure hazard, and it is a SILENT wrong
value rather than a throw. It does not touch this stack's rows: the compiled
`@js-temporal/polyfill` artifact contains no `new Proxy` (verified on the
artifact, 0 occurrences). The second `it` in the witness pins the residual so it
is a finding rather than a surprise — when #6628 is fixed, that expectation
tightens from 0 to 15 rather than being deleted.

Also NOT covered, deliberately: the `set` / `deleteProperty` / `has` traps. The
reverse channel has no raw `set`/`delete` terminal, and `has`'s existing
tri-state conflates "not mine" with "mine but absent", which would turn a
legitimate `false` into a throw. All ten target rows are get-trap rows. Adding
the write side means three more terminals and a matching install-ABI bump; it
should be its own slice with its own rows to justify it.

#### S63 full-battery table (completed 2026-09-19 09:31 UTC, per-file diff vs the S62 base TSVs)

This supersedes nothing above — the four-family numbers stated earlier in this
section are these numbers; the table here adds the A–F half.

Four families — the four-family total moves **447/480 → 457/480**:

| Family | Base | S63 | pass→fail | fail→pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PlainDate | 113/120 | 116/120 | 0 | 3 |
| Duration | 106/120 | 108/120 | 0 | 2 |
| PlainDateTime | 113/120 | 116/120 | 0 | 3 |
| ZonedDateTime | 115/120 | 117/120 | 0 | 2 |

A–F must-not-move (3,204 files, every group byte-for-byte the same per-file
pass/fail assignment, not merely the same total):

| Group | Base | S63 | pass→fail | fail→pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 1129/1250 | 1129/1250 | 0 | 0 |
| B | 179/205 | 179/205 | 0 | 0 |
| C | 274/349 | 274/349 | 0 | 0 |
| D | 224/300 | 224/300 | 0 | 0 |
| **E-unlinked** | 238/300 | 238/300 | **0** | 0 |
| **E-linked** | 238/300 | 238/300 | **0** | 0 |
| F-class | 136/250 | 136/250 | 0 | 0 |
| F-methoddef | 68/100 | 68/100 | 0 | 0 |
| F-objproto | 136/150 | 136/150 | 0 | 0 |

The two E groups are the Proxy+Reflect must-not-move sets and are the ones this
change could plausibly have moved; both are flat.
