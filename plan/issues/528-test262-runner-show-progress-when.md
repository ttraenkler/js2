# Issue #528: Test262 runner -- show progress when starting each batch

## Problem
The runner shows no output until the first category batch completes (~30-60s). Users see "Running 22972 tests..." then silence. It looks hung.

## Solution
Print a line when each batch starts, showing percentage and test count:
```
  [  0%] Math (273 tests)...
```

Also print when retesting previously-failed tests:
```
  Retesting 30 previously-failed tests...
```

## Files Changed
- `scripts/run-test262.ts`

## Implementation Summary
- Added a `console.log` before each batch dispatches to workers, showing `[pct%] batchName (N tests)...`
- Changed "Prioritizing" message to "Retesting" for clarity
- Added NaN guard for percentage calculation when total is 0
- Verified output format with `npx tsx scripts/run-test262.ts language/types`
