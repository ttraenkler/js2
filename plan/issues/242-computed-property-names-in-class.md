# Issue #242: Computed property names in class declarations (remaining 57 errors)

## Status: done

## Summary

57 tests fail with "A computed property name in a class property declaration must have a simple literal type or a 'unique symbol' type". Sprint 2's #223 fixed computed property names in basic class declarations, but these remaining errors involve computed properties with expressions that TypeScript cannot resolve to a literal type.

## Root Cause

TypeScript requires computed property names in class declarations to be of type `string`, `number`, `symbol`, or `any`. When the expression is a variable or complex expression, TypeScript rejects it. In allowJs mode, this diagnostic should be suppressed since the JS spec allows any expression as a computed property name.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- TypeScript diagnostic filtering
- Tests affected: ~57 compile errors

## Expected Impact

Suppressing this diagnostic would allow ~57 tests to attempt compilation. Many may then hit other errors (unknown identifier, unsupported call), so net improvement is estimated at ~20-30 new passing tests.

## Suggested Approach

1. Identify the TypeScript diagnostic code for "A computed property name in a class property declaration must have a simple literal type"
2. Add it to the diagnostic suppression list for allowJs mode
3. In the codegen, evaluate the computed property name expression at compile time if possible, or fall back to a string representation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Computed property names with variable expressions compile in allowJs mode
- [x] At least 20 compile errors resolved
- [x] No regression in existing computed property tests

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Diagnostic codes TS1166 ("A computed property name in a class property declaration must have a simple literal type") and TS2464 ("A computed property name must be of type 'string', 'number', 'symbol', or 'any'") were added to the `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` set in `src/compiler.ts`. Additionally, TS1468 (a related computed property type diagnostic) was also suppressed.

### Files changed
- `src/compiler.ts` -- added diagnostic codes 1166, 2464, 1468 to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES`

### What worked
Downgrading these diagnostics from errors to warnings allows computed property names with arbitrary expressions to compile in allowJs mode, unblocking ~57+ test262 tests.

### Related issues
- #265 and #276 were identical in scope and resolved by the same code changes.
