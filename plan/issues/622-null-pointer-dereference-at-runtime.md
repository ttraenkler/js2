# #622 — Null pointer dereference at runtime (707 FAIL)

## Status: in-review
707 tests fail with "RuntimeError: dereferencing a null pointer" — struct.get/struct.set on a null reference at runtime.

### Root cause
Class method, constructor, and setter parameters with default values were typed as
non-nullable `ref N` in the Wasm function signature. When callers omitted the argument,
`pushDefaultValue` emitted `ref.null N` + `ref.as_non_null`, which traps immediately
because the ref is null. This happened before the callee's default-value initialization
code could run.

Standalone functions already had the fix (widening `ref` to `ref_null` for params with
initializers), but class members did not.

Additionally, `destructureParamObject` lacked a null guard — unlike
`destructureParamArray`, it did not wrap its struct.get operations in an
`if (not null)` block.

### Fix
1. In all class member parameter registration paths (method type placeholders,
   constructor, setter, and method compilation), widen `ref` to `ref_null` when
   the parameter has an `initializer` (default value).
2. Add a null guard to `destructureParamObject` following the same pattern as
   `destructureParamArray`: pre-allocate binding locals, wrap destructuring in
   `if (ref.is_null) then [] else [struct.get ...]`.

## Complexity: M

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Widened parameter types from `ref` to `ref_null` for parameters with default
  values in 6 locations in `src/codegen/index.ts`:
  - Method type placeholder registration (line ~7828)
  - Constructor type placeholder registration (line ~7765)
  - Setter type placeholder registration (line ~7924)
  - Constructor compilation (line ~9463)
  - Method compilation (line ~9740)
  - Setter compilation (line ~10021)
- Added null guard to `destructureParamObject` with pre-allocation of binding
  locals and if-not-null wrapping of struct.get operations.
- Added test file `tests/null-pointer-deref.test.ts` with 4 test cases.
- Added `tests/null-destructure-param-object.test.ts`, verifying no crash on
  undefined object destructuring params.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — param type widening + destructureParamObject null guard
- `tests/null-pointer-deref.test.ts` — new test file
- `tests/null-destructure-param-object.test.ts` — null object destructuring guard
  coverage

### What worked
- Standalone functions already had the `ref` -> `ref_null` widening for default
  params; the fix was applying the same pattern to class members.
- The `destructureParamArray` null guard pattern was directly reusable for
  `destructureParamObject`. When a nullable parameter is null, destructuring is
  skipped and binding locals keep their zero-initialized defaults.
- This prevents the "RuntimeError: dereferencing a null pointer" crash for the
  test262 cases that pass undefined/null to functions with object destructuring
  parameters.

### What didn't work
- Initial approach of adding null guards only to struct.get sites was too broad
  (hundreds of sites). The root cause was the parameter type itself, not the
  access sites.
