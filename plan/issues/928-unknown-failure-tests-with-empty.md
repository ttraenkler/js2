# #928 -- Unknown failure tests with empty error message (209 FAIL)

## Problem

209 tests fail with `unknown failure` — the test runner could not capture any error output. The Wasm module compiled and ran but produced no usable error information. This makes debugging these failures impossible without individual investigation.

## Error pattern

```
unknown failure
```

## Sample test files

- `test/language/expressions/arrow-function/dstr/dflt-ary-ptrn-elision-step-err.js`
- `test/language/expressions/class/dstr/async-gen-meth-ary-ptrn-rest-id-elision-next-err.js`
- Concentrated in destructuring and class element tests

## Root cause

Likely causes:
1. The Wasm module traps without a catchable exception (e.g., stack overflow, infinite loop timeout)
2. The test harness error capture mechanism misses certain failure modes
3. The compiled code returns a non-zero exit code without writing to stderr

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Investigate the top 10 "unknown failure" tests to determine root cause categories
- [ ] Fix the error capture mechanism if it's a runner issue
- [ ] If it's a compiler issue: >=100 of 209 tests produce either PASS or a meaningful error message
- [ ] Document the failure categories in this issue

## Notes

Start by manually compiling 5-10 sample tests and running them to see what actually happens. The `unknown failure` label suggests the test runner is swallowing the real error.
