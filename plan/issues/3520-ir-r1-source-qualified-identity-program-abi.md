# #3520 — IR-only R1: source-qualified identity and whole-program ABI map

## Objective

Give every source and synthetic compiler unit a structural, source-qualified
identity and build one deterministic `ProgramAbiMap` before changing which
front-end emits bodies.

This is an identity/ABI landing, not an ownership flip. The same units still
take the same direct, compile-twice, or IR-overlay route as before. R1 removes
the name-collision and late-slot-allocation assumptions that would otherwise
make R2's prepare-before-emit inversion unsound.

## Current evidence

The current middle-end calls a display string an identity:

- `src/ir/nodes.ts:36-52` defines `IrFuncRef`, `IrGlobalRef`, and `IrTypeRef`
  with only `{ kind, name }`; the comments explicitly bind those names to the
  legacy context maps.
- `src/ir/nodes.ts:2591-2605` makes `IrModule` only a flat function array;
  imports, globals, types, exports, classes, and synthetic units are not a
  program-owned contract.
- `src/ir/from-ast.ts:561-570` chooses `options.funcName ?? fn.name.text`, and
  `calleeTypes` / `classShapes` / `moduleBindings` are flat string maps
  (`:444-470`, `:503-517`).
- `src/ir/integration.ts:150-220` keys propagated signatures and local calls by
  function name. Its post-pass table at `:685-710` also joins functions by
  name.
- `src/ir/passes/inline-small.ts:88-102` and
  `src/ir/passes/monomorphize.ts:99-126` build `byName` maps. A duplicate
  display name silently overwrites the earlier entry before either pass.
- `src/codegen/index.ts:4970-5046` copies import aliases between the flat
  `funcMap`, `closureMap`, and `moduleGlobals` namespaces. The multi-source
  overlay must separately collect name collisions at `:5274-5284` because the
  IR itself cannot represent distinct same-named declarations.
- `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts:1078-1118` registers instance and static methods
  from the same `${className}_${methodName}` display name. The existing
  collision guard deliberately suppresses a second placeholder; getters and
  setters need separate spelling conventions at `:1197-1283`.
- `src/ir/integration.ts:921-970` finds `__module_init` by display name and
  patches class/module slots allocated by legacy compilation. That adapter is
  temporary and cannot be the identity model for an IR-only program.

These are not hypothetical multi-source-only hazards. Two files may both
declare `main`; two nested classes may both be named `C`; one class may have
static and instance `m`; and `get x` / `set x` are separate executable units
even though users see one property name.

## Identity contract

Add one canonical identity vocabulary, with a single encoder/comparator:

- `IrSourceId` is independent of the process cwd and absolute checkout path.
  It combines a normalized program-relative source key with the source's
  deterministic compiler order. The entry file and synthesized/lib sources
  have explicit kinds; no `Map` insertion accident defines order.
- `IrUnitId` identifies an executable source unit by source, lexical owner
  chain, unit kind, and declaration ordinal. Kinds cover top-level functions,
  class constructors/methods/accessors, object methods, nested declarations,
  closures, module init, and synthetic support units.
- `IrClassId` identifies a class declaration/expression by source, lexical
  owner, and declaration ordinal. The class's spelling is only `displayName`.
- `IrBindingId` (or an equivalently closed union) identifies function, global,
  import, type, export, and synthetic/runtime bindings. A callable reference
  distinguishes a source `IrUnitId` from an intrinsic/import/support binding;
  no ad-hoc magic string enters the identity domain.
- Synthesized identities derive from `{parentId, role, ordinal}`. Lifted
  closures and monomorphized clones never derive uniqueness from a generated
  display name or a type string alone.

Identity values must be immutable and serializable for diagnostics/tests. A
human-readable label is stored separately and may remain byte-compatible with
current telemetry. Equality, maps, call graphs, passes, and ABI resolution may
never use that label.

The inventory exposes two explicit populations rather than conflating nested
support artifacts with terminal source outcomes:

- `allUnits` is exhaustive over source, nested, lifted, and synthetic support
  units. Records rooted in an existing R0 attempt carry `terminalOwnerId` and,
  where applicable, `lexicalOwnerId`. A genuinely exhaustive unit for which R0
  has no attempt root carries `terminalOwnerId: null` plus
  `unownedReason: "no-r0-attempt-root"`; R1 must not fabricate a terminal
  outcome merely to make ownership total.
- `terminalUnits` is the exact one-to-one population consumed by the R0 outcome
  ledger. Its count must equal terminal outcomes, while every additional
  owned `allUnits` record must resolve to one terminal owner.

An equality check between `allUnits.length` and the R0 outcome count is invalid:
R0 deliberately attributes lifted/support preparation failures to their source
owner. R1 makes that relationship structural instead of manufacturing extra
terminal rows.

## `ProgramAbiMap` contract

Build one whole-program inventory in deterministic source order. The map owns:

1. Every source and synthetic unit, class, and binding identity.
2. Callable signatures, global storage, imported callable/global signatures,
   Wasm type intents, exports, class layouts, and support-unit relationships.
3. Stable source order and dependency order, including explicit parent/child
   links for lifted closures and constructor support units.
4. The intention and eventual final-layout Wasm index for each identity.
   `ProgramAbiMap` is an identity/intention ledger, not an allocator:
   `ModuleAssembler` remains the sole allocator, and only binds finalized
   indices after planning. A second binding, an unplanned binding, or two
   identities sharing a non-alias slot is an R0 `Invariant`. In particular,
   global/type raw indices are never preallocated or cached by the ABI plan.
5. Explicit aliases. An import alias, inherited member, or export alias points
   to a canonical binding ID; it is not implemented by copying a display-name
   map entry.

R1 supplies a narrow `LegacyAbiAdapter` (name may follow repository
conventions) so existing direct code can resolve its old `funcMap`,
`moduleGlobals`, `structMap`, and export slots from `ProgramAbiMap`. The
adapter is the only string-keyed compatibility boundary. It must:

- generate collision-free internal Wasm names from IDs while preserving the
  old spelling when it is unambiguous;
- reject an ambiguous reverse lookup instead of choosing first/last wins;
- record intentional aliases separately from accidental collisions; and
- expose the old display labels for telemetry without making them keys.

Repairing the current runtime/legacy collision behavior through this adapter is
later R1 work. The first shadow landing proves identity and alias semantics
without rewiring `funcMap`, `moduleGlobals`, `structMap`, exports, or module
arrays, so it cannot claim that existing runtime collisions are fixed.

## Bounded landing sequence

### Commit 1 — identities and exhaustive inventory

- Add the identity types, canonical encoder/comparator, and source-order
  builder.
- Inventory single- and multi-source ASTs without changing selection or body
  routing.
- Cover class declarations/expressions, static/instance/accessor distinctions,
  nested scopes, object methods, lifted functions, module init, and known
  synthetic support roles. Unsupported syntax is still inventoried.
- Cross-check the R0 outcome ledger: every terminal row maps to exactly one
  `terminalUnits` identity, every `allUnits` record resolves through
  `terminalOwnerId`, and legacy labels/histograms remain unchanged.

### Commit 2 — key source planning and analyses by identity

- Replace source-unit string keys in `propagate.ts`, `type-evidence.ts`,
  `select.ts`, `ast-lowering-plans.ts`, imported/module-binding plans,
  promise-delay ownership, IR-first call-graph closure, outcome reconciliation,
  and self-host selection with structural IDs. Keep `class-member-keys.ts` as
  the legacy slot adapter until Commit 4.
- Key source-level recursion/SCC evidence by identity and add a validated
  source-owner ID only at the linear integration seam. Escape, ownership,
  stack-allocation, encoding, and string-evidence analyses already key their
  semantic facts by IR value/allocation IDs and do not need a source-name
  migration. Property names, intrinsic names, layout field names, and the
  generic linear-plan `ownerFunction` label remain strings in this commit.
- Keep existing selection results, preparation order, and diagnostics stable;
  this commit changes lookup identity only.

### Commit 3 — key IR references, passes, and backends by identity

- Replace name-keyed local-call/type maps in `from-ast.ts`, `integration.ts`,
  lowering, verification, overlay finalization, and backend contracts with
  IDs.
- Put an `IrUnitId` on every `IrFunction`; make direct calls carry a typed
  callable binding ID. Keep `name` only as a display/debug field.
- Key inlining, recursion/SCC analysis, monomorphization, and clone edit tables
  by identity. A clone receives a derived ID; its display name may retain the
  current format.
- Make WasmGC, linear integration, and external-backend adapters consume the same
  binding identity. Backend-local scratch labels and concrete export strings
  remain explicit labels below the ABI boundary.
- Keep runtime/helper string references behind a typed intrinsic/import binding
  variant until R6; do not invent source IDs for runtime providers.

### Commit 4 — ABI map and legacy-slot adapter

- Plan/import/intern every ABI entry once, then feed current declaration and
  integration code through the compatibility adapter.
- Replace collision scanners and name-based patch lookup where an ID is
  available. Keep the existing routing order and legacy body emitters.
- Preserve current public export names. Internal name changes are permitted
  only for a real collision and require runtime evidence.
- Emit diagnostic tables sorted by canonical source/unit order, never JS `Map`
  accident or filesystem walk order.

## R1a implementation status — PR #3490 (merged)

PR #3490 merged to `main` at `9e813698d081417330476e64d495149508b24a76`.
The issue remains `in-progress` on the R1b continuation branch.

Implemented in the bounded landing:

- opaque, serializable `IrSourceId`, `IrUnitId`, `IrClassId`, and
  `IrBindingId` encodings whose uniqueness does not use display names;
- dependency-first source ordering from compiler-resolved edges when available,
  with authoritative empty/external resolutions, unique relative/bare-specifier
  fallback only when resolution is unavailable, checkout-independent
  `@library/` keys, collision rejection, and raw canonical source-key SCC
  ordering as the disconnected-root/cycle tie-breaker;
- fixed-width numeric identity components, so the canonical text comparator
  orders source orders and regular/derived ordinals numerically past 9;
- producer-tagged provenance for timer, node:path, typed Node import wrappers,
  generated ambient import classes, eval/super early-error IIFEs,
  process.stdin, and Iterator source rewrites. Synthetic IDs use semantic
  producer roles; repeated units with the same parent and role use an explicit
  sibling ordinal rather than a display spelling;
- an exhaustive final-target source-AST/compiler-prelude `allUnits` inventory
  plus the exact R0-compatible `terminalUnits` population, including nullable
  ownership for compiler support units that have no R0 attempt root. The
  host-free dead-binding pass snapshots pre-elision ordinals so every retained
  support node keeps its ID; deliberately removed support nodes remain absent
  and never manufacture terminal rows;
- additive `sourceId` / `unitId` fields on compiler-produced terminal outcomes,
  while legacy outcome key, label, count, and order remain unchanged;
- a validated `indexIrTerminalDeclarations` AST-node-to-ID join so subsequent
  declaration planning does not need to rejoin by display name; and
- a semantic/shadow `ProgramAbiMap` and read-only `LegacyAbiAdapter` data-
  structure seam with
  separate plan/final-bind phases, explicit `required | alias | none` policy,
  deterministic numeric plan order, namespace-aware lookup, and typed
  alias/export/final-index invariants. Production codegen does not build this
  map yet, so this landing does not claim whole-program ABI completeness.

Intentionally deferred from this PR:

- changing source planning, call graphs, IR references, passes, or backends to
  use the new IDs (the remainder of commits 2 and 3);
- assigning derived identities to pass-created lifted closures,
  monomorphization clones, and other post-AST support units (Commit 3);
- giving every nested node inside one compiler helper its own named semantic
  role. Iterator helper children currently derive from the semantic top-helper
  parent/role plus structural sibling ordinal; this is deterministic for the
  current helper AST but internal sibling edits intentionally revise those
  child IDs;
- binding current codegen slots into `ProgramAbiMap`, or changing
  `ModuleAssembler` allocation/finalization order; and
- routing the legacy runtime maps through `LegacyAbiAdapter` or repairing their
  current collision cases. Those binding points require the broader locked R1
  file set and runtime evidence; the shadow seam is interface/invariant
  groundwork, not runtime-collision completion.

Remaining numbered work:

- **Commit 2:** thread `IrUnitId` from the validated declaration index through
  selection, propagation, source planning, recursion/SCC evidence,
  imported/module binding, promise-delay, self-host planning, the additive
  linear source-owner join, and terminal outcomes. Keep class-member naming as
  the legacy adapter; value/allocation-keyed ownership, escape, stack, encoding,
  and string-evidence analyses do not need migration here.
- **Commit 3:** put identities on IR functions/references, key inline and
  monomorphization edits structurally, derive IDs for pass-created units, and
  carry the same binding identities through verification/lowering/backends.
- **Commit 4:** populate the whole-program ABI intentions, bind only
  ModuleAssembler-final indices, then route legacy maps/exports through the
  adapter and prove runtime collision behavior plus non-collision byte parity.

## Commit 2 implementation plan — source planning by identity

**Active R1b branch:** `symphony/3520-r1-planning-identity`

### Root cause

R1a created structural source/unit/class identities, but production planning
still rebuilds independent name maps in each phase. `buildTypeMap`, recursive
evidence, selection, IR-first closure, imported/Promise plans, and overlay
reconciliation can therefore resolve the same declaration through different
`Map<string, ...>` instances. Multi-source compilation makes the defect
observable: the inventory distinguishes two declarations named `main`, while
planning still collapses or conservatively rejects them by that label.

The R1a terminal join is also only half-threaded. Outcome rows carry `unitId`,
but `recordObservedIrOutcomes` immediately rejoins selection, failures, and
integration events through `legacyMatchName`. Commit 2 must make the ID the
join key before Commit 3 changes `IrFunction` and `IrFuncRef` themselves.

### One per-program identity context

**Files: `src/ir/identity.ts` and new internal
`src/ir/planning-identity.ts`**

`buildIrUnitInventory` remains the only inventory builder. Its scanner records
the exact source, unit-declaration, and class-declaration objects while it
constructs the returned `IrUnitInventory`; that scanner metadata is associated
with that exact inventory object. `buildIrPlanningIdentityContext` consumes the
already-built inventory and validates the scanner metadata. It must never call
`buildIrUnitInventory`, clone/reconstruct an inventory, or recover a declaration
through name, text, line, or span matching. A copied or independently rebuilt
inventory is rejected with the typed `untracked-inventory` invariant.

The new internal module owns the context/error/validation implementation and
keeps the large identity scanner within the repository LOC budget. This split
does not receive a LOC-budget allowance and does not change any baseline.

```ts
export interface IrPlanningIdentityContext {
  readonly inventory: IrUnitInventory;
  readonly sourceIdBySourceFile: ReadonlyMap<ts.SourceFile, IrSourceId>;
  readonly sourceFileBySourceId: ReadonlyMap<IrSourceId, ts.SourceFile>;
  readonly unitIdByDeclaration: ReadonlyMap<ts.Node, IrUnitId>;
  readonly declarationByUnitId: ReadonlyMap<IrUnitId, ts.Node>;
  readonly terminalByUnitId: ReadonlyMap<IrUnitId, IrTerminalUnitRecord>;
  readonly classIdByDeclaration: ReadonlyMap<ts.ClassDeclaration | ts.ClassExpression, IrClassId>;
  readonly declarationByClassId: ReadonlyMap<IrClassId, ts.ClassDeclaration | ts.ClassExpression>;
  readonly moduleInitUnitIdBySourceId: ReadonlyMap<IrSourceId, IrUnitId>;
  readonly moduleInitUnitIdBySourceFile: ReadonlyMap<ts.SourceFile, IrUnitId>;
}

export function buildIrPlanningIdentityContext(inventory: IrUnitInventory): IrPlanningIdentityContext;
```

Ordinary unit and class entries use their exact scanner-captured declaration
object. Only two semantic anchors are explicit:

- module init is source-owned and therefore appears in
  `moduleInitUnitIdBySourceId` / `moduleInitUnitIdBySourceFile`, not in the
  declaration maps; and
- an implicit constructor is anchored to its owning class declaration or
  expression. Unit and class maps are separate, so that class-like node may
  validly map to both its constructor `IrUnitId` and its `IrClassId`.

A field-initializer support unit retains its own scanner-captured declaration.
There is no general exception that permits a consumer to search by span. Every
forward/reverse pair, terminal owner, source object, and module-init anchor is
validated; duplicate or missing entries are typed R0 invariants.

Dependency order is a derived view, not a second identity index: iterate
`context.inventory.sources` and resolve each record through
`context.sourceFileBySourceId`. This preserves the inventory's SCC/canonical-
key ordering for planning without changing the existing global R0 source loop
or legacy body-emission order.

The compiler builds the final complete inventory once, after all source
rewrites/reparses, then immediately derives one context from that same object.
Single- and multi-source overlays receive that context; no per-source overlay
may rebuild inventory. Checker resolution must select an exact declaration and
look it up in the context. Checker-free textual resolution remains conservative:
only a unique eligible declaration in the existing domain may project to the
legacy path; ambiguous or absent targets retain the current demotion.

### Validated legacy projection retained by Commit 2

Commit 2 does not yet make `IrFunction` or the codegen slot tables structural.
It therefore retains a validated, one-to-one compatibility projection for each
active source-planning population:

```ts
interface IrLegacyUnitProjection {
  readonly unitId: IrUnitId;
  readonly legacyName: string;
}
```

Both directions are validated: an ID has exactly one legacy name and a legacy
name identifies at most one active ID at the receiving API. A collision is
demoted by the current typed collision/safety policy before a name-keyed call;
it is never collapsed by first/last wins. The originating `unitId` remains on
the selection, plan, skip/preparation record, and outcome evidence across that
call, and a returned name is accepted only through the same projection.

This compatibility projection remains required for the still-name-keyed
`compileIrPathFunctions`, `IrTypeOverrideMap`, `from-ast` `calleeTypes`,
`classShapes`, and integration interfaces until Commit 3 or 4 replaces those
interfaces. Class resolution likewise carries `{ classId, legacyName }`; the
local class-expression resolver returns that pair, while `classShapes` remains
name-keyed. `class-member-keys.ts` and every existing static/instance/accessor
collision guard remain active legacy adapters.

### Ordered migration of planning consumers

The dependency order is load-bearing:

1. Land `IrPlanningIdentityContext` over the exact existing inventory and
   export it only through the internal IR barrel.
2. Key propagation and recursive source evidence by `IrUnitId`; derive
   deterministic worklist/SCC order from the context.
3. Make selection and source plans carry unit/class IDs for every executable
   owner/target, without changing which units are selected.
4. Build and validate the one-to-one legacy projection before invoking the
   still-name-keyed compile, override, class-shape, from-AST, or integration
   APIs. Preserve collision demotion.
5. Carry the original ID through IR-first closure, preparation, integration
   correlation, and terminal outcome reconciliation.
6. Add source owner IDs only at the linear integration seam and tighten the
   existing self-host cache eligibility/fingerprint behavior.

Do not start Commit 3's `IrFunction`/`IrFuncRef` migration in this slice. In

### String-versus-identity boundary

After Commit 2, structural source-planning state uses `IrUnitId`/`IrClassId`
for selection membership, caller/callee closure, recursive components, owner/
target facts, blocked/skip decisions, and terminal joins. Strings remain valid
for local/parameter/property/field names, import/export spellings, public names,
intrinsics/helpers, concrete Wasm names, diagnostics, and current legacy slot
interfaces.

The validated `{ unitId, legacyName }` projection is deliberately still used as
a semantic compatibility boundary for `compileIrPathFunctions`,
`IrTypeOverrideMap`, `calleeTypes`, `classShapes`, and integration. The ID must
remain alongside every projected name, and reverse correlation must use the
same one-to-one projection. Thus Commit 2 removes independent name re-joins
without claiming that all string-keyed compiler APIs have already disappeared.

Commit 2 does not assign `IrBindingId` to module globals, put IDs on
`IrFunction`/`IrFuncRef`, derive IDs for lifted/monomorphized functions, migrate
generic linear-plan ownership, or bind ABI slots. Those remain Commit 3/4 work.

### Outcome join and parity requirements

The existing global R0 source loop remains unchanged. Within each source,
`recordObservedIrOutcomes` consumes that source's terminal records in canonical
inventory order and addresses structural state by `unitId`. It validates named
integration evidence through the source's one-to-one projection rather than a
global `legacyMatchName` map.

For every terminal ID, apply and record exactly one branch in this stable
precedence:

1. an inventory-authored `directFailure`;
2. the selector's typed rejection;
3. a typed preparation failure;
4. the explicit `static-class-member` compile-twice outcome;
5. a typed late-preparation rejection;
6. the explicit `module-init-legacy-coupling` integration outcome;
7. another typed integration error; or
8. successful, exactly-once patch evidence.

Duplicate or absent terminal/evidence IDs, multiple compiled/error events for
one projection, a same-label event owned by another ID, or leftover unconsumed
integration evidence produces the existing typed invariant. Branch precedence
must not silently mask duplicate evidence. R0 row count/order, fallback
histograms, `displayName`, `key`, public compiled-name telemetry, the global
source-loop order, and emitted binaries remain unchanged.

### Anti-vacuity tests for Commit 2

Extend `tests/issue-3520-ir-unit-identity.test.ts` and add focused planning
fixtures only where required. Prove behavior through real consumers:

1. Build an inventory once, derive `IrPlanningIdentityContext` from that exact
   object, and prove its forward/reverse maps, source-derived dependency view,
   source-owned module init, and class-anchored implicit constructor. A copied
   or rebuilt inventory must fail as `untracked-inventory`; no span match is
   accepted.
2. Give two files declarations named `same` and classes named `C`; reverse
   caller insertion order and prove distinct propagation/selection IDs with no
   inventory rebuild. Where the receiving legacy API cannot represent both,
   prove the existing collision demotion instead of a collapsed name entry.
3. Create same-named recursive SCCs with different scalar evidence and prove
   the worklist, Tarjan components, decisions, and diagnostics stay attached to
   the correct IDs.
4. Cover instance/static `m`, get/set `x`, repeated computed labels, nested
   same-named classes, class expressions, and implicit constructors. Prove the
   local resolver returns `{ classId, legacyName }`, class shapes remain behind
   the validated projection, and current slot demotions/output do not change.
5. Resolve default and renamed imports through checker declarations. Prove
   `makeIrImportedFunctionResolver(..., identityContext)` returns the exporting
   unit ID and that call/function-value plans retain owner/target IDs across the
   named from-AST/integration boundary.
6. Give same-named Promise/Date owners and `<module-init>` units in two files;
   prove blocked/preparation/outcome state stays separate and named events only
   correlate through their exact pairs.
7. Exercise module binding from a function and module init. Prove structural
   owner IDs coexist with exact binding declaration identity and that a same-
   spelled shadowed local is not captured.
8. Exercise the linear source integration seam with same-label source owners.
   Prove its additive/sidecar `ownerUnitId` is total while generic allocation
   plans still use their unchanged schema and value/allocation IDs.
9. Prove the self-host `memoKey` eligibility and no-ctx-bound-type/resolver
   guard remain active: eligible identity-free templates fingerprint safely,
   while a ctx/typeIdx-dependent build never reads or writes the cache.
10. Cover every outcome branch above, including inventory `directFailure`,
    `static-class-member`, and `module-init-legacy-coupling`; reject same-label
    cross-ID evidence and prove per-source canonical order without changing the
    global source loop. Keep legacy rows/histograms and tracked/untracked output
    byte-identical.

Run the new tests with the R1a identity/ABI/outcome suites, #2138, linear,
self-host, phase3c, equivalence, and cross-backend differential validation. Run
#1983 and inline-small separately as control-matched known-failure matrices:
their exact failures must match the pre-branch base and are not an expected
green command. No local Test262 run or baseline refresh belongs to this commit.

### Commit 2 risks and containment

- **Inventory substitution:** rebuilding or copying an inventory loses its
  scanner object joins. Build once, require exact object identity, and reject
  untracked inventories.
- **AST identity invalidation:** a transform after inventory construction makes
  exact node maps stale. Finish rewrites first; reject unknown nodes without a
  text/span fallback.
- **Ambiguous checker edges:** aliases, overloads, merged declarations, and
  reassignments may resolve to multiple/non-executable declarations. Accept one
  indexed executable declaration or retain Unsupported/compile-twice behavior.
- **Legacy projection collision:** structural planning cannot make the current
  named compiler API represent two occupants. Preserve collision demotion,
  validate both projection directions, and never use first/last wins.
- **ID loss at return:** a name-only compiled/error result can be attached to
  the wrong unit. Retain the ID sidecar through the call, consume each named
  result once through the exact projection, and reject leftovers/duplicates.
- **Linear scope creep:** `IrFunction` lacks a structural ID. Add owner identity
  only at source integration; changing the generic plan would also require the
  #3298/#3299/#3300/#3502 test families and
  `scripts/benchmark-allocation-policies.mts`, so defer that schema change to
  Commit 3.
- **Self-host cache leakage:** a fingerprint cannot make ctx/type-index state
  context-free. Preserve eligibility guards and defer caching when any resolver
  state is bound to the active compilation.

### Commit 2 implementation status

Implemented on the active R1b continuation branch:

- the exact inventory scanner now retains frozen source/unit/class declaration
  metadata outside the serializable identity records;
- `buildIrPlanningIdentityContext(existingInventory)` validates immutable
  bidirectional source, unit, terminal, class, and source-owned module-init
  mappings without rebuilding the inventory or joining by display/span;
- `indexIrTerminalDeclarations` now consumes those exact record/node joins;
  copied or independently rebuilt inventories are rejected; and
- the planning implementation lives in `src/ir/planning-identity.ts` so
  `identity.ts` remains below the 1,500-line subsystem limit without an
  allowance or baseline change.

Validation for this foundation is **30/30** identity tests, **10/10** ABI
tests, and **96/96** across the expanded identity/outcome/multi-source/producer
matrix. Typecheck, lint, formatting, diff, and LOC-budget checks pass. This is
stage 1 of the ordered Commit 2 plan.

Stage 2 now adds the structural propagation boundary:

- `IrLegacyUnitProjection` validates an immutable one-to-one active
  `{unitId, legacyName}` population and correlates returned named evidence
  exactly once. Duplicate IDs/names, missing or mismatched pairs, foreign or
  duplicate results, and deterministic leftovers are typed invariants.
- `buildIrUnitTypeMap` keys declaration collection, calls, inbound sites,
  seeds, worklists, and results by `IrUnitId`. Checker resolution joins only
  exact indexed declarations; checker-free textual resolution is admitted
  only for a unique active label.
- `buildIrRecursiveTypeEvidence` keys SCC graphs, components, decisions,
  signatures, anchors, owners, and targets by `IrUnitId`. Canonical work order
  comes from the authoritative inventory.
- The still-name-keyed selector/integration seam is served only through the
  validated projection. Duplicate labels are conservatively omitted from that
  compatibility population instead of choosing a first or last structural
  owner.

The focused Stage 2 suites pass **13/13**. The existing propagation/evidence
consumer matrix passes **95 tests with 1 skipped**, including reversed-source
numeric and string recursive SCCs that share a display name plus a third
non-recursive peer. Typecheck, lint, formatting, diff, and LOC-budget checks
pass.

Stage 3 threads that context through the production entry seams:

- single-source and multi-source WasmGC planning build one inventory/context
  and retain that exact context from propagation through terminal outcomes;
- tracking-only compilation preserves the pre-R1 binary/result behavior while
  deriving its outcome population from the same authoritative inventory;
- linear propagation and recursive evidence share one inventory/context rather
  than independently rebuilding their source population; and
- outcome collection requires the exact `SourceFile` object, resolves its
  `IrSourceId`, filters terminal units by that ID, and deduplicates whole-source
  failures by source ID. A cloned AST with the same filename is rejected with
  the typed `source-record-mismatch` invariant.

The Stage 3 checkpoint passes **86/86** focused identity, context, propagation,
projection, outcome, multi-source, and linear tests. Typecheck, lint,
formatting, diff, and LOC-budget checks pass. Selection, feature plans,
IR-first closure, and final outcome correlation still need to retain IDs
through their remaining legacy calls.

Stage 4 adds the structural selector and a fail-closed legacy projection:

- `planIrCompilationByIdentity` keys function/member claims, fallbacks,
  recursive evidence, and local call edges by `IrUnitId`; class-member facts
  also retain their exact `IrClassId`, while names remain compatibility labels;
- exact terminal/class/module ownership is validated against the authoritative
  context. Missing or mismatched joins raise typed planning invariants instead
  of becoming name lookups, plain errors, or silent omissions;
- the structural receiving population includes unnamed functions, anonymous
  class members, and implicit-constructor terminals even when an existing
  direct failure keeps them outside the claim set;
- duplicate function/class labels and repeated class-shape descriptors never
  choose first/last wins. The adapter omits ambiguous occupants and re-closes
  their local-call component with the existing host-versus-standalone caller
  policy before producing the still-name-keyed `IrSelection`; and
- the structural selector reuses the production selector predicates and has a
  direct unambiguous projection-parity test. This checkpoint is additive; the
  production overlay has not switched to it yet.

The Stage 4 selector suite passes **12/12**. The combined #3520, #3142,
#3143, and #3529 selector/preclaim matrix passes **192/192**. Typecheck, lint,
formatting, diff, and LOC-budget checks pass. The standalone #1169q control
retains its pre-existing async fallback-expectation mismatch (**9/10**); no
selector semantics changed. No local Test262 run or baseline refresh was
performed.

Stage 5 moves the production overlay onto that structural selector boundary and
adds exact imported-target identity without changing the legacy lowering API:

- production builds one `IrUnitTypeMap`, selects through
  `planIrCompilationByIdentity`, and retains the exact selection, omitted IDs,
  declaration/type rows, and safe `IrUnitId` population throughout override
  preparation;
- the still-name-keyed override, integration, and slot interfaces receive only
  the validated unambiguous projection. Within-source duplicate labels are
  omitted before preparation, and safe names are projected only from the
  retained safe IDs;
- every preparation-time removal keeps the structural safe-ID population and
  its legacy projection synchronized. The old independent selector call,
  independently projected TypeMap, and last-wins top-level declaration scan
  are no longer used by the production overlay;
- the imported-function resolver now has an additive structural form that
  resolves checker-selected declarations to exact `targetUnitId` values.
  Cross-source same-label targets remain distinct and are marked ambiguous
  only at the final legacy compatibility projection; and
- the existing two-argument imported resolver preserves its behavior, while
  cloned, stale, duplicate, or out-of-population source objects fail with typed
  planning invariants in the structural form.

The combined Stage 5 matrix passes **265/265** across all #3520 identity,
projection, context, selector, and overlay suites plus #3214 callable/imported
callback coverage, #3142 module-init, #3143 IR-first, #3529 selector preclaim,
and #2138 multi-module overlay. Typecheck, lint, formatting, diff, and
LOC-budget checks pass. No local Test262 run or baseline refresh was performed.

Stage 6 carries structural identity through the first exact lowering plans:

- imported-call, top-level function-value, and host-callback plans now retain a
  required `ownerUnitId`; imported/function-value plans also retain the exact
  checker-selected `targetUnitId`;
- multi-source production creates the exact imported resolver from the
  authoritative planning context, gives selection only its explicit
  ambiguity-rejecting legacy adapter, and correlates every named certification
  back to the exact resolver at the same AST node before constructing a plan;
- integration receives the validated owner-ID projection alongside the
  remaining name-keyed plan maps and supplies the exact active owner to the
  AST lowerer. Imported calls, function values, host callbacks, and their
  nested lifted bodies reject missing or mismatched owner IDs before emitting
  IR; and
- target IDs remain side-by-side with the current symbolic backend names. This
  stage does not claim that `IrFuncRef` or backend slot lookup is structural
  yet; that is Commit 3 work.

The expanded structural/overlay/feature matrix passes **269/269**. The
fallback gate remains unchanged with zero unintended, post-claim, or
module-level increases, and hybrid IR-only readiness remains **31 emitted / 6
typed Unsupported / 0 Invariants** across 37 terminal units. Typecheck, lint,
formatting, diff, and LOC-budget checks pass.

Stage 7 completes Commit 2's source-planning identity migration:

- Promise-delay plans, module-binding uses, local-class evidence, host-Date
  snapshot plans, and the linear source seam retain exact owner/class IDs.
  Name-keyed lowering and slot APIs are reached only through their validated
  legacy projections;
- blocked-component closure, IR-first skip selection, multi-source safety, and
  terminal outcome correlation are ID-keyed. Named compiler results cannot
  satisfy a foreign or same-labelled unit, and closure is computed over the
  full safe function population before the requested skip subset is projected;
- class shapes are indexed by `IrClassId` with exact checker-selected
  declarations and parent identities. The remaining class-shape name map is a
  checked compatibility view rather than semantic identity;
- integration validates the exact selected function, class-member, compiler
  support, and module-init AST populations. Finalization also proves that
  callback, Promise, and Date sites remain reachable from their exact active
  owners. Replaced, detached, or reordered AST populations fail with typed
  planning invariants instead of matching by text or span;
- integration reports distinguish terminal compiled owners from synthetic
  artifacts and reconcile every logical error event with all public error
  objects. Raw compiled/error labels are telemetry only and cannot prove
  terminal success or patch safety;
- the fallback gate now carries the graph-wide identity inventory, context,
  unit types, and structural selection through its accounting, projecting to
  labels only for the final stable histogram; and
- new identity plumbing was extracted from `planIrOverlay` and
  `generateMultiModule`. Both functions are smaller than the pre-Stage-7 HEAD,
  so the checkpoint adds no new god-function size debt.

The complete #3520 matrix passes **145/145** and the compatibility matrix
passes **249/249**. Hybrid IR-only readiness remains **31 emitted / 6 typed
Unsupported / 0 Invariants** across 37 terminal units. The fallback gate has
zero unintended, post-claim, or module-level increases. Typecheck, formatting,
diff, and LOC-budget checks pass; the six existing god-file baseline failures
remain, while both functions touched by this stage shrink. No local Test262 run
or baseline refresh was performed.

Commit 2 is complete. `IrFunction`/`IrFuncRef`, pass edit tables, verification,
and backend callable references remain the next Commit 3 boundary; whole-
program ABI binding and the legacy slot adapter remain Commit 4.

Stage 8 begins Commit 3 by making function-artifact identity total:

- every `IrFunction` now carries its required `IrUnitId`; the builder accepts
  the structural ID and compatibility label atomically, and WasmGC integration
  rejects a selected function, class member, or module initializer that lacks
  its exact prepared identity;
- main functions retain their terminal owner ID. Lifted closures and nested
  functions derive IDs from `{ parentId, "lifted-closure", ordinal }`, with
  label and ID allocated from the same counter. Monomorphization clones derive
  from the callee ID and canonical clone-plan ordinal rather than clone names;
- the linear integration seam supplies the same owner IDs, and every other
  production pass copy preserves `unitId`. Repeated benchmark construction now
  uses explicit, stable artifact IDs rather than process-order counters;
- the self-host cache stores an `Omit<IrFunction, "unitId">` template, checks
  resolver/dialect/type-index eligibility before lookup, fingerprints the
  template input, and rematerializes a fresh artifact with the caller's live
  support ID; and
- the frozen interchange contract is now v2.0. Serialized functions and
  coverage rows both require `unitId`; `name` is documented as the temporary
  compatibility/reference label while callable/global/type references remain
  symbolic in this bounded sub-slice.

The #3520/backend/phase3c matrix passes **168/168**; including the repeated-
benchmark identity proof, the focused matrix has **174 passing** with one
intentional skip. The compatibility matrix passes **233/233** and the cross-
backend differential suite passes **29/29**. Full equivalence remains **1,608
passing / 35 failing** against 36 known baseline failures: there are no new
regressions and one baseline failure now passes; the baseline is intentionally
unchanged. Hybrid IR-only readiness remains **31 emitted / 6 typed Unsupported
/ 0 Invariants** across 37 terminal units, and the fallback gate has zero
unintended, post-claim, or module-level increases. The separate six-file
known-base matrix is **51 passing / 11 known failures** on this branch versus
**50 passing / 12 failures** on exact control `7906aa8a80327c`: all 11 branch
failures reproduce identically, while the required-identity fixture migration
fixes one stale scaffold failure. Typecheck, lint, formatting, diff, and LOC-
budget checks pass. No local Test262 run or baseline refresh was performed.

Commit 3.1 is complete. Typed callable binding/reference migration, structural
pass edit tables, and backend binding consumption remain the next Commit 3
sub-slices; whole-program ABI binding and the legacy slot adapter remain Commit 4.

Stage 9 completes the Commit 3.2 callable-binding checkpoint:

- every `IrFuncRef` carries a required closed binding domain: exact source or
  compiler unit, declared import, runtime symbol, intrinsic, or structurally
  derived support binding. Factories validate and freeze those references;
  the verifier rejects legacy name-only calls and lifted-function references,
  including refs nested inside buffered control-flow instructions;
- source direct calls are planned at their exact `CallExpression` sites and
  carry the target `IrUnitId` plus signature. Imported calls, top-level
  function values, closure trampolines, lifted functions, Promise support,
  class dispatch, and monomorphized clone calls retain their structural target
  or provider binding instead of reconstructing identity from a label;
- WasmGC binds source-unit refs through an exact unit-to-slot table and never
  falls back to a same-labelled runtime/helper slot. Linear Wasm and external backends
  bind source units by ID as well; runtime, intrinsic, and import dispatch use
  their structural symbol or module field. The remaining compatibility label
  use is confined to the temporary exact unit/support-to-legacy-slot adapter;
- helper preregistration and string-encoding analysis classify by binding
  domain and symbol. Source functions deliberately named like string,
  dynamic-boxing, or undefined-check helpers do not register or resolve the
  corresponding provider; and
- the interchange contract is now v3.0. Schema and documentation require the
  closed callable binding union while retaining `name` only as compatibility
  and diagnostic metadata.

The changed-file matrix passes **115/115** with two intentional skips. The
binding-aware backend/self-host matrix passes **50/50** with one optional
external-backend skip; the class inheritance/collision matrix passes **21/21**; and the
linear/cross-backend regression matrix passes **35/35**, including all 29
differential cases. Typecheck and diff checks pass, and the protected Test262
log and equivalence baseline are unchanged. The LOC allowance records this
checkpoint's required contract threading; extracting the remaining legacy
adapter machinery is follow-up work rather than part of this paused slice.

Commit 3.2 is ready for review. Structural inline/monomorphization edit maps,
integration evidence maps, and the final Program ABI slot adapter remain for
Commit 3.3 and Commit 4 before R1 can close.

## Resume checkpoint

- **Branch:** `symphony/3520-r1-planning-identity`
- **Draft PR:** `#3496`
- **Resume from:** the branch tip containing Stage 9 / Commit 3.2. The pushed
  worktree is expected to be clean; no stash or local-only patch is required.
- **First task:** replace the remaining source-function `byName` tables in
  `src/ir/passes/inline-small.ts` and `src/ir/passes/monomorphize.ts` with
  `IrUnitId`/callable-binding maps. Recursion detection, rewrite sites, clone
  plans, and pass-output reconciliation must all use the same structural key.
- **Then:** migrate integration verifier/error/pass bookkeeping to IDs, thread
  support/import bindings through the backend ABI tables, and replace the
  temporary exact-unit/support-to-legacy-label slot join with `ProgramAbiMap`
  resolution. Only after those steps should R1 acceptance be reevaluated.
- **Do not touch:** `benchmarks/results/test262-run.log` or
  `scripts/equivalence-baseline.json`. No local Test262 run is required for
  this checkpoint.
- **Known unrelated control:** two #2956 L3 string/charCode fixtures remain
  pre-existing failures; binding-affected linear cases and the 29-case
  cross-backend suite pass.
- **Not rerun after Stage 9:** the full equivalence gate and fallback/readiness
  ratchets. Run them before declaring R1 complete; do not infer completion from
  the focused matrices below.

### 2026-07-25 resume state

- Pulled `origin/main` to `6f3e4358033ab8`, then merged it into the continuation
  branch at `30e3553f48b972`. Draft PR #3496 now has a current-main checkpoint.
  The main checkout's existing Test262 log change and `.capc-worktree` link
  were left untouched.
- Reconciled current-main #3565 verifier demotions with #3520's grouped
  terminal-evidence ledger. Public diagnostic order stays stable, while a
  mixed verifier event selects a real invariant as its terminal
  representative. Current-main #2952's new iterator-close call is also typed
  as a runtime binding instead of reintroducing a name-only `IrFuncRef`.
- Merge validation is green: **64/64** focused #2138/#3519/#3520/#3565/#680
  tests, **71/71** #2952 control-flow tests, TypeScript with incremental output
  disabled, scoped Biome lint, Prettier, and diff checks on the resolved files.
- The pre-dispatch gate correctly reported the existing
  `ttraenkler/codex-r1` claim and active #3518 dependency; this is the same R1
  continuation, not a competing dispatch. Three isolated, pushed Symphony
  worktrees were assigned disjoint Commit 3.3 lanes:
  `symphony/3520-c33-inline`, `symphony/3520-c33-monomorphize`, and
  `symphony/3520-c33-integration`.
- Commit 3.3 also absorbed current-main #3551: its ABI-withdrawal cascade,
  reference scan, and orphan-slot records now use exact callable/unit and
  owner identities while preserving withdrawal and stubbing behavior.

### Commit 3.3 completion

- Integrated and pushed the three isolated lanes:
  `5fb6df6272df26` keys inline-local resolution and recursion by `IrUnitId`;
  `06e51c25e4873b` keys monomorphization grouping, clone provenance, growth,
  and edit tables by identity; and `6cf2d2744ae4ee` keys integration artifact
  ownership, failure/TU evidence, pass reconciliation, ABI withdrawal, and
  orphan-slot ownership structurally.
- Added exact duplicate-label/provider regressions for inline,
  monomorphization, nested withdrawal, tagged-union attribution, and
  synthetic-vs-terminal report classification. Runtime/import/intrinsic/
  support lookalikes never become local unit edges.
- Combined validation passes **209/209** across 32 focused #3520/#3529/#3551/
  #3565/#3471/phase3c files. A strict-nullability rerun exposed and fixed an
  impossible post-pass artifact dereference at `fa789b2cc4cbc6`; the focused
  post-fix matrix passes **45/45**, TypeScript is green with incremental output
  disabled, and scoped Biome, Prettier, diff, and LOC checks pass.
- Commit 4 is active in three additional isolated, pushed worktrees:
  `symphony/3520-c4-class-identity`,
  `symphony/3520-c4-backend-identity`, and
  `symphony/3520-c4-abi-session`. The cutover must publish one program-owned
  ABI map after the index space freezes; a per-source map is not acceptable.

### 2026-07-26 Commit 4 foundation checkpoint

The Commit 4 foundation is integrated through `54f30f076f8dbb`, but R1
acceptance remains partial and this issue stays `in-progress`. The integrated
sequence is:

- `100d13edd532d9` makes class shapes source-qualified, and
  `e9674975ee622c` keys class integration caches and checks by exact
  `IrClassId`;
- `b88293dc401ebe` creates one compilation-owned `ProgramAbiSession` for each
  single- or multi-source compilation that requests the IR identity inventory;
- `cf88b88f6d2bc8` keys source-function backend tables by `IrUnitId`;
- `8a574b16b2e6e4` binds the currently adapted globals through structural
  `IrBindingId` references; and
- `50816a88d826f5` plus `216f5ea9e1c370` harden the session lifecycle and make
  every adapted global producer prove the same canonical payload and
  structural order; and
- `54f30f076f8dbb` removes the obsolete name-keyed local-call and
  overlay-finalization cluster after every production caller moved to the
  `IrUnitId`-keyed implementation.

The foundation now validates these boundaries:

- a single session owns the inventory, plan, allocator-object locators, and
  publication for its exact `WasmModule`;
- module, TDZ, argument-count, and function-value-cache globals are planned by
  canonical binding payload rather than display name;
- the runtime API supports exact defined-function/global locator replacement,
  imported slot resolution after late index shifts, and explicit type-cell or
  type-object remaps; and
- publication is one-shot and occurs immediately after
  `indexSpaceFrozen = true`, so final indices are resolved from the frozen
  module layout.

Validation at `216f5ea9e1c370` passes the strict TypeScript check; all #3520
suites plus backend contract, linear integration, and cross-backend coverage
(**34 files / 239 tests**); Prettier; scoped Biome lint with the two existing
`index.ts` `any` warnings; the diff check; and the LOC-budget check. After the
cleanup, the #3143, #3203, #2138, and complete #3520 matrix passes
**249/249**, and `check:dead-exports` reports **15 known / 0 new**. Strict
TypeScript, Prettier, scoped Biome, diff, and LOC checks remain green.

This is not yet the whole-program ABI cutover described by Commit 4:

- production `ProgramAbiSession` planning currently covers the adapted defined
  globals only; callable signatures, callable/global imports, Wasm types,
  classes/layouts, exports, aliases, support bindings, and derived-unit
  provenance are not yet populated as production ABI entries;
- source functions and classes carry structural identity through the IR and
  pass tables, but concrete WasmGC, linear, and compatibility-slot resolution
  still contains direct `funcMap`, `structMap`, module-array, and display-name
  scans instead of routing exclusively through `LegacyAbiAdapter`;
- function/global replacement and type remap APIs have focused lifecycle
  coverage, but allocator replacement, dead-type elimination, and compaction
  do not yet notify the production session; and
- exports are still emitted directly by legacy codegen rather than represented
  as explicit Program ABI aliases.

Accordingly, the acceptance criteria below remain unchecked. This checkpoint
does not enable IR-only mode by default and does not justify retiring any
direct codegen path. Preparation ownership, compile-once migration, remaining
runtime/async/linear adoption, fallback removal, and direct-handler deletion
remain later R2-R10 work and are explicitly outside R1.

### Final PR #3496 validation

- The branch was merged forward through current-main runtime, call, literal,
  interpreter, module-init, global-environment, and baseline-contract changes.
  Main-owned semantics remain present, including the current #2726
  global-environment delete guard.
- The required CI guard suite exposed a missing structural-order anchor for
  ambient and transformed-import classes that have no executable `IrUnit`.
  `ProgramAbiStructuralOrder` now assigns those classes deterministic,
  source-local tail anchors while preserving the existing source, unit, and
  member-backed class anchors. Dedicated coverage includes multiple zero-unit
  classes, mixed live/ambient populations, reversed source input, transformed
  import wrappers, and the exact #2961/#3565 regressions; the final focused
  post-merge matrix passes **44/44**.
- Strict TypeScript, full Biome lint, Prettier, diff, LOC, function-budget,
  oracle, dead-export, issue, and change-scoped quality gates pass. The
  dead-export audit reports **15 known / 0 new** after deleting the obsolete
  name-keyed overlay cluster.
- The post-main regression matrix passes **397 tests in 43 files**, with 46
  intentional Test262-harness skips. It covers every #3520 suite, #2138,
  backend contract, linear integration, cross-backend differential coverage,
  and the current-main #2928/#3615/#3623/#3637/#3638/edition fixtures.
- `check:ir-fallbacks -- --verbose` reports no unintended, post-claim, or
  module-level increase. Hybrid IR-only readiness remains **READY** across 37
  terminal units: **31 emitted / 6 typed Unsupported / 0 Invariants**.
- Full equivalence reports **1,608 passing / 35 known failures**, with no new
  regression and one known baseline failure now passing. The equivalence
  baseline remains unchanged.
- No local Test262 corpus run was performed.
  `benchmarks/results/test262-run.log` and
  `scripts/equivalence-baseline.json` remain unchanged.

### PR #3496 merge-group regression repair

- Exact merge-group run `30183268819` at head
  `83b55f7790096a93aa60c97c25cd14e22d30b1e3` failed the Test262 regression
  and standalone guards against immutable baseline commit
  `de3acdd66f5e9835108502b92e4648747e541a3d`. The host gate reported 63
  stable non-timeout regressions and 31 improvements; 56 of those regressions
  shared the structural-identity diagnostic repaired here. All 52 standalone
  non-CT regressions shared the same diagnostic.
- The field-evaluation support record and a function or arrow used as its
  initializer both used the initializer expression as their declaration
  anchor. This violated the planning context's intentional declaration/unit
  bijection. Field evaluation is a property operation, while the nested
  callable is a separate executable unit, so static and instance field units
  now anchor to their `PropertyDeclaration`. An implicit constructor likewise
  anchors to its class declaration rather than borrowing the first instance
  initializer.
- Moving the inventory anchor exposed a second stale assumption in IR-first
  call-edge collection: property initializers still resolved their terminal
  owner through the initializer expression. They now resolve the field unit
  through the property declaration, then retain the initializer expression as
  the body boundary. This preserves module-init ownership for static fields and
  constructor ownership for instance fields without aliasing nested callable
  units.
- Both defects have red-before-fix invariant tests. The focused identity matrix
  passes 39/39. Replaying the exact affected baseline-pass/candidate-regression
  paths locally restores 56/56 host rows and 52/52 standalone rows to runtime
  pass. A fresh-process standalone replay also passes 52/52 on both this branch
  and current-main control `dde8800c95694231e76ca3a56512a4060dbf81ad`.
  The baseline and allowlists are unchanged; rows outside this diagnosed
  signature are not attributed to this repair.
- After merging current main `c941712943f45994149480b60165b5e18afb9505`,
  the complete #3520/#2138 matrix passes 212/212. Strict TypeScript, lint,
  formatting, LOC, fallback, and hybrid IR-readiness gates pass, with 31
  emitted / 6 typed Unsupported / 0 Invariants. The linear/cross-backend matrix
  passes 43/43. Full equivalence reports 1,608 passing / 35 known failures,
  zero new regressions, and one known baseline failure now passing; the
  equivalence baseline remains unchanged.

### 2026-07-26 production callable/imported-global continuation

The first production ABI populations after PR #3496 are implemented on
`codex/3520-c4-production-abi`:

- every inventory-backed source/unit callable observed by WasmGC IR integration
  now receives the canonical `callable/body` binding ID, a structural callable
  reference key, a canonical signature intention, and an exact
  `WasmFunction` locator;
- migrated unit calls resolve through
  `ProgramAbiSession.resolveCurrentIndex(...)`, so late function-import shifts
  are resolved from the current allocator layout instead of a captured
  `funcMap` index;
- overlay replacement and orphan stubbing update the exact function locator in
  the same mutation seam, so ABI publication follows the final function object;
- host string-constant globals now plan exact imported-global intentions
  anchored to the unique entry source, including deterministic literal order,
  deduplication, late/interleaved imports, lone-surrogate field encoding, and
  the valid empty import field; and
- native-string builds retain the no-import sentinel path and publish no
  string-constant ABI entries.

The complete #3520 matrix plus #2138 multi-source coverage passes **216/216**
across **35 files**. Strict TypeScript, LOC budget, Prettier, and diff checks
pass. Hybrid readiness remains **READY** at **31 IR-emitted / 6 typed
Unsupported / 0 Invariants / 37 legacy bodies**, and the fallback ratchet
reports no unintended, post-claim, or module-level increase. Full equivalence
reports **1,608 passing / 35 known failures / 0 new regressions**, with one
known baseline failure now passing; the baseline remains unchanged.
The existing `ir-scaffold` host fixture still fails **1/7** because it does not
provide the already-requested `env.__unbox_number` import; the identical
failure reproduces on untouched PR #3496 head `c96312ba`.

This remains a bounded R1 continuation, not the final ABI cutover. Derived
lifted and monomorphized units remain explicitly unplanned because
`LoweredFunctionResult` and the monomorphization sidecar do not yet preserve
the complete `{ parentId, sourceId, terminalOwnerId, role, ordinal }`
`ProgramAbiDerivedUnitRecord`. No display-label or encoded-ID inference is
used. Imported/runtime/intrinsic/support callables, remaining imported globals,
Wasm types and class layouts plus DCE remaps, exports and aliases, and
production `LegacyAbiAdapter` replacement of the remaining `funcMap`,
`structMap`, module-array, and display-name scans still remain before R1 can
close.

### 2026-07-26 lifted-callable provenance continuation

The next stacked continuation on `codex/3520-c5-derived-provenance` moves
successfully emitted lifted closures into the production Program ABI:

- lifted allocation now preserves exact `{ id, parentId, role, ordinal }`
  provenance beside `LoweredFunctionResult`; integration joins it to the
  authoritative inventory's `sourceId` and terminal owner by ID, never by
  output order, encoded ID, or display label;
- accepted lifted functions register complete `ProgramAbiDerivedUnitRecord`
  values only after lowering has produced the settled Wasm function and
  signature. The owner body retains derived suborder zero and its owner-wide
  lifted ordinals occupy one-based suborders;
- the backend keeps an exact `IrUnitId -> WasmFunction` table and resolves the
  current live or stable function handle from the allocator object. Synthetic
  compatibility labels may therefore collide with source functions without
  aliasing their slots or locators;
- derived callable planning occurs after the placeholder is replaced, so the
  ABI records the real lowered signature rather than placeholder type zero;
  and
- integration telemetry continues to classify terminal versus synthetic
  artifacts from exact artifact/owner IDs. Equal public labels no longer
  manufacture a false invariant.

The production collision regression compiles one source owner, two lifted
closures, and a top-level function deliberately named like the first lift. All
four callables publish distinct final function slots while the legacy
name-only adapter correctly rejects the ambiguous label. The complete #3520
matrix plus #2138 passes **221/221** across **36 files**. Strict TypeScript,
Prettier, scoped Biome lint, diff, and LOC checks pass. Hybrid readiness remains
**READY** at **31 IR-emitted / 6 typed Unsupported / 0 Invariants / 37 legacy
bodies**, and the fallback ratchet reports no unintended, post-claim, or
module-level increase. The eight-shard equivalence gate passes with **1,608
passing / 35 known failures / 0 new regressions**; one baseline failure now
passes.

This is still a bounded lifted-only slice. Monomorphization already creates
exact clone IDs but its result sidecar drops the clone role and parent-local
ordinal. More importantly, clone-local ordinals are not injective across
different lifted parents after structural ordering collapses to the inventory
ancestor. The next derived-unit slice must preserve full clone provenance and
assign an explicit provenance-path (or equivalent owner-wide) ABI rank before
monomorphized clones can leave the compatibility adapter. Provider/import/
runtime/support callables, remaining imported globals, Wasm types and class
layouts plus DCE remaps, exports and aliases, and the production
`LegacyAbiAdapter` cutover remain after that.

### 2026-07-26 monomorph-clone provenance continuation

The next stacked continuation on `codex/3520-c6-monomorph-provenance` moves
monomorphization clones through the same exact derived-unit Program ABI
contract:

- `monomorphize` now returns one immutable
  `{ id, parentId, role: "monomorphization-clone", ordinal }` provenance record
  for every clone, including clones whose parent is itself a lifted unit. The
  legacy clone-origin sidecar remains temporarily for compatibility, and
  integration rejects any disagreement between origins, provenance,
  signatures, and output functions.
- Integration composes each clone's `sourceId` and `terminalOwnerId` through
  its exact parent record. It registers the complete derived graph
  topologically before callable planning, so module/pass insertion order
  cannot make a child appear to be an inventory root or erase a lifted parent.
- `ProgramAbiStructuralOrder` assigns dense, deterministic per-root ranks from
  complete role/ordinal provenance paths. Source bodies retain rank zero;
  parents precede descendants; the same clone ordinal under two different
  lifted parents cannot collide; and reverse registration/planning order
  produces the same ABI order.
- Ordering is sealed per inventory root rather than globally. A source that
  has started planning rejects later descendants beneath that root, while a
  distinct source may still register a child before its parent. Root-local
  descendant traversal also prevents an unrelated incomplete provenance graph
  from poisoning another source's ordering.

The production integration-contract regression runs the real monomorphizer,
then injects two contract-valid ordinal-zero clones beneath two real lifted
closures sharing one source owner. The clones are deliberately placed before
their parents and in reverse order; publication still recovers
owner/lift/clone provenance order, exact binding IDs, distinct final function
slots, exact function objects, and the distinguishing `f64` versus branded
boolean parameter/result types. This seam is intentionally explicit:
production source lowering currently normalizes direct-call tuples to one
callee signature, so no natural source fixture reaches monomorphization with
heterogeneous tuples. Pass-level tests continue to prove real clone discovery,
call rewriting, and ordinals.

The strengthened regression also exposed the next concrete R1 boundary.
Callable intents containing capture-reference types retain their pre-DCE
`typeIdx`, while the final located Wasm function correctly uses the compacted
post-DCE index. Final identity, locator, and callable dispatch are correct, and
no current consumer treats the stale signature metadata as authoritative.
Program ABI type intentions plus DCE remap notification must nevertheless land
before signatures or aliases can become authoritative; the regression binds
all stable non-capture positions and documents the deferred ref-index check.

The complete #3520 matrix plus #2138 passes **224/224** across **37 files**.
Strict TypeScript, Prettier, scoped Biome lint, diff, and LOC checks pass.
Hybrid readiness remains **READY** at **31 IR-emitted / 6 typed Unsupported /
0 Invariants / 37 legacy bodies**, and the fallback ratchet reports no
unintended, post-claim, or module-level increase. The eight-shard equivalence
gate passes with **1,608 passing / 35 known failures / 0 new regressions**; one
baseline failure now passes, and the baseline remains unchanged.

This remains a bounded R1 slice. Provider/import/runtime/support callables,
remaining imported globals, Program ABI type intentions and DCE remaps, class
layouts, exports and aliases, and the production `LegacyAbiAdapter` cutover
still remain before R1 can close.

### 2026-07-26 type-layout authority continuation

The next stacked continuation on `codex/3520-c7-type-remap` makes the callable
and global intentions already populated by production code authoritative
through DCE type compaction:

- callable and global planners retain immutable structured `ValType`
  contracts beside the frozen public draft. The public canonical strings are
  materialized only at publication, after all reported layout changes;
- dead type elimination constructs the complete old-to-final type-index
  vector, including explicit `null` entries for eliminated types, and reports
  the exact before/after type arrays while the old layout is still installed;
- `ProgramAbiSession` validates the complete layout before changing state,
  remaps every callable/global reference and exact type cell together, and
  rejects invalid, incomplete, ambiguous, or eliminated-reference layouts;
- matching aliases inherit the remapped canonical contract. Aliases whose
  original intent differs retain their own intent and continue through the
  existing `ProgramAbiMap` mismatch checks; and
- function/global locator replacements and final publication validate the
  concrete allocator object against the tracked contract. A late replacement
  can no longer make stale metadata look authoritative.

The production regression compiles a real lifted closure and a contract-valid
monomorph clone whose capture reference shifts during DCE. Both published
signatures now exactly equal their final located Wasm function types, including
the compacted capture index and their distinct `f64` versus branded-boolean
parameters/results. Lower-level regressions cover callable, alias, global, and
type-cell remapping plus transactional rejection of malformed layouts.

The complete #3520 matrix plus #2138 passes **227/227** across **38 files**.
Strict TypeScript, Prettier, scoped Biome lint, diff, LOC, function-budget,
dead-export, and oracle-ratchet checks pass. Hybrid readiness remains **READY**
at **31 IR-emitted / 6 typed Unsupported / 0 Invariants / 37 legacy bodies**,
and the fallback ratchet reports no unintended, post-claim, or module-level
increase. The eight-shard equivalence gate passes with **1,608 passing / 35
known failures / 0 new regressions**; one baseline failure now passes, and the
baseline remains unchanged.

This closes the concrete stale capture-reference gap exposed by C6, but not all
of R1. Provider/import/runtime/support callables, remaining imported globals,
Program ABI type and class-shape intentions, exports and aliases, and production
`LegacyAbiAdapter` replacement of the remaining `funcMap`, `structMap`,
module-array, and display-name scans still remain before R1 can close.

### 2026-07-26 function-value support-callable continuation

The next stacked continuation on `codex/3520-c8-support-callable` moves the
cached top-level function-value trampoline into the production Program ABI:

- function-value preparation now validates and publishes the exact trampoline
  and closure-cache allocator objects as one pair. The trampoline is a
  unit-anchored `callable/support` entry; its existing companion cache remains
  an exact `global/support` entry;
- support-callable planning recomputes the opaque binding ID from the
  authoritative unit anchor and semantic role, owns one exact required
  `WasmFunction` locator, and registers the complete callable type contract.
  The API deliberately supports only ordinal zero until structural ordering
  has an explicit artifact-ordinal dimension;
- the resolver consults a planned support binding by structural key before any
  intrinsic, runtime, or compatibility-name fallback. Once planned, a support
  reference cannot silently redirect through `funcMap`; and
- the paired planning helper lives in `program-abi-planning.ts`, leaving the
  already-large codegen driver seven lines smaller than the C7 branch.

The production regression passes a deliberately nonexistent compatibility
label through the real integration resolver and proves that it still reaches
the exact trampoline slot. It then verifies that the published signature
contains a reference type and exactly matches the final post-DCE function
type. A source-name collision separately proves that a demoted owner publishes
no nonexistent support entry. Planner regressions cover relabelling, a late
function import, mismatched reference role and final signature, and duplicate
allocator ownership.

The complete #3520 matrix plus #2138 passes **232/232** across **39 files**.
The related #3214 callable and imported-HOF matrix passes **60/60** across
**3 files**.
Strict TypeScript, Prettier, Biome lint, diff, LOC, function-budget,
dead-export, and oracle-ratchet checks pass. Hybrid readiness remains **READY**
at **31 IR-emitted / 6 typed Unsupported / 0 Invariants / 37 legacy bodies**,
and the fallback ratchet reports no unintended, post-claim, or module-level
increase. The eight-shard equivalence gate passes with **1,608 passing / 35
known failures / 0 new regressions**; one baseline failure now passes, and the
baseline remains unchanged.

This is the first non-unit defined support callable with an authoritative
production locator, not the end of R1. Non-externref class constructor/init
callables are covered by C9; class-method adapters and externref/Promise-host
helpers remain. Exact imported callable IDs and import locators, dual-mode
runtime/intrinsic providers, remaining imported globals, Program ABI
type/class-layout entries, exports and aliases, and the production
`LegacyAbiAdapter` cutover still remain.

### 2026-07-26 class constructor/support-callable continuation

The next stacked continuation on `codex/3520-c9-class-support-callables`
makes the non-externref WasmGC class constructor pair structurally
authoritative in the production Program ABI:

- `<Class>_new` now resolves to exactly one inventoried
  `class-constructor` or `class-implicit-constructor` unit beneath the exact
  `IrClassId`. The integration seam binds that unit to the allocator-owned
  constructor slot; an omitted source constructor remains a source-unit
  callable and never receives a fabricated support identity.
- `<Class>_init` is now a class-owned `callable/support` entry anchored by the
  exact `IrClassId` and semantic `class-constructor-init` role. It carries
  class-local structural order, the exact defined-function locator, and a
  callable contract that is checked again against the final post-DCE type.
- Support-callable intent now requires exactly one inventoried owner: a unit
  or a class, never both. Source callables reject class provenance;
  import/runtime callables reject source provenance; foreign owners and wrong
  source order fail with typed Program ABI invariants. Session draft equality
  includes the class owner.
- Compatibility-only integration builds and reuses the same exact planning
  identity context for class-shape resolution. Missing or duplicate
  constructor units, absent or mismatched allocator slots, and non-function
  `_init` types fail closed instead of falling back through a display label.
- A collision fixture relocates a compiler-owned `A_init` beside a user
  function named `A_init`, proves distinct ABI IDs and final function slots,
  verifies the published post-DCE signature against the located function, and
  executes the IR `super(...)` path to `"Rex/4|Lab|99"`.

The focused C9 matrix passes **21/21**. The complete #3520 matrix plus #2138
passes **243/243 across 41 files**; the class/collision matrix passes
**27/27**; and the linear/cross-backend/class matrix passes **43/43**. Strict
TypeScript, Biome lint, Prettier, diff, LOC, function-budget, dead-export,
oracle-ratchet, and issue-spec checks pass. Hybrid readiness remains **READY**
at **31 IR-emitted / 6 typed Unsupported / 0 Invariants / 37 legacy bodies**,
and the fallback ratchet reports no unintended, post-claim, or module-level
increase. The eight-shard equivalence gate reports **1,608 passing / 35 known
failures / 0 new regressions**; one baseline failure now passes and the
baseline remains unchanged. No local Test262 corpus run or baseline refresh
was performed.

This is a bounded class-constructor ABI slice, not completion of class or R1
ABI ownership. Externref-backed classes (including the JS-host Promise
`*_new__onhost` path) have no WasmGC `_init` and remain excluded. Inherited
ordinary instance-method adapters are covered by C10; inherited accessors,
statics, and other synthetic helpers remain. Exact imported callables and
import locators, dual-mode runtime/intrinsic providers, Program ABI
type/class-layout entries, exports and remaining alias families, and production
`LegacyAbiAdapter` replacement of the remaining `funcMap`, `structMap`,
module-array, and display-name scans still remain before R1 can close.
Preparation/body ownership, routing policy, and R2-R10 work are unchanged.

### 2026-07-26 inherited instance-method alias continuation

The next stacked continuation on `codex/3520-c10-class-method-aliases` moves
projected local instance-method adapters into the production Program ABI:

- an inherited child method is now an explicit class-owned support alias of
  the exact ancestor source-method callable. The alias has its own structural
  reference, provenance, deterministic inventory-derived order, and callable
  contract, but owns no locator or independent function slot;
- ancestor class shape, AST declaration, source unit, allocator handle,
  `WasmFunction` object, and current Program ABI slot must all agree before the
  alias can be planned. The legacy label is only a consistency assertion and
  cannot select the canonical method;
- structural resolution follows `aliasOf` through the canonical source
  callable. A relocated child compatibility key therefore remains stable
  across import insertion, type-layout remapping, and final DCE publication;
  and
- accessors, statics, externref-backed classes, unresolved projections, and
  builds without a Program ABI session deliberately remain on the
  compatibility seam until their member/provider identities are exact.

The production regression covers an `A -> B -> C` hierarchy, a method
overridden in `B`, a second method inherited transitively from `A`, and a user
function that collides with `C_m`. It proves that `C.m` aliases the exact `B.m`
source unit, `C.n` aliases the exact `A.n` source unit, neither child adapter
allocates a function, both published post-DCE reference-bearing signatures
match their canonical functions, the colliding user function owns a distinct
slot, and the emitted program executes to the expected value. Planner
regressions cover reversed discovery order, multiple derived ordinals,
relabelling, late function imports, type remapping, structural-reference
mismatch, and wrong owner/role/ordinal identities.

The complete #3520 matrix plus #2138 passes **246/246 across 42 files**; the
focused class/planner matrix passes **41/41**; and the
linear/cross-backend/class matrix passes **43/43**. Strict TypeScript, Biome
lint, Prettier, diff, LOC, function-budget, dead-export, and oracle-ratchet
checks pass. Hybrid readiness remains **READY** at **31 IR-emitted / 6 typed
Unsupported / 0 Invariants / 37 legacy bodies**, and the fallback ratchet
reports no unintended, post-claim, or module-level increase. The eight-shard
equivalence gate reports **1,608 passing / 35 known failures / 0 new
regressions**; one baseline failure now passes and the baseline remains
unchanged. No local Test262 corpus run was performed.

C10 completes the currently identified inherited ordinary instance-method
projection, not the remaining class/provider surface or R1. Exact imported
callable IDs and import locators, dual-mode runtime/intrinsic providers,
inherited accessors, externref/Promise-host helpers, Program ABI
type/class-layout entries, exports and remaining alias families, and the
production `LegacyAbiAdapter` cutover still remain. R2 must then prepare the
whole IR program before body emission; R3-R8 move function, class,
module-initializer, multisource, runtime/async, and linear ownership to that
program; R9 removes fallback policy; and R10 deletes the direct codegen path.

### 2026-07-26 retained imported-callable continuation

The next stacked continuation on `codex/3520-c11-import-callables` moves the
module's retained function-import population into the production Program ABI:

- before IR body lowering, every registered function import is validated and
  cataloged by its exact module/field structural key and allocator `Import`
  object. Import refs now resolve through that exact object and current import
  position; a compatibility label cannot redirect the call through
  `funcMap`;
- pre-DCE cataloging deliberately creates no required ABI slots. After
  dead-import and type elimination settles the final module, every retained
  function import receives a deterministic entry-source-owned callable ID,
  complete final signature contract, structural reference, and exact
  `import-function` locator;
- repeated module/field imports are real production allocator entries rather
  than a theoretical error case. The most recently inserted retained object
  owns the base structural ref used by current symbolic IR; every earlier
  retained duplicate receives a separate allocator-occurrence key, ID,
  signature, and final slot. This preserves existing module-index semantics
  without consulting the compatibility map; and
- single- and multi-module finalization invoke the same retained-import
  planner immediately after DCE and before Program ABI publication.

The production regression lowers a real `console.log(number)` import call,
passes a deliberately false adapter label through the resolver probe, verifies
the exact published `env.console_log_number` import object and post-DCE
signature, and executes the emitted program. Planner regressions cover reverse
registration order, equal fields from different modules, late import shifts,
reference-bearing type remapping, runtime-immutable catalogs, dead
preparation-only imports, allocator duplicates, malformed signatures, and
missing entry provenance.

The complete #3520 matrix plus #2138 passes **255/255 across 44 files**. The
focused catalog/production/structural matrix passes **40/40**; the full #3214
imported-HOF and host-callback matrix passes **60/60**; and the linear,
cross-backend, and adjacent constructor matrix passes **43/43**. Strict
TypeScript, lint, scoped Prettier, diff, LOC/function budget, dead-export,
checker-oracle, issue-spec, and fallback gates pass.

The hybrid readiness lane remains **31 IR-emitted / 6 typed Unsupported / 0
Invariant across 37 terminal units**, with all 37 legacy bodies still emitted.
The full equivalence gate reports **1,608 passing / 35 known failing / 0 new
regressions** and one prior baseline failure now passing; the shared baseline
was deliberately left unchanged. This continuation did not run a local
Test262 shard.

C11 closes retained raw function-import IDs and exact import-object locators,
not semantic provider ownership or R1. Dual-mode runtime/intrinsic providers,
inherited accessors, static and externref/Promise-host support helpers, Program
ABI type/class-layout entries, exports and remaining alias families, and the
production `LegacyAbiAdapter` cutover still remain before R2 can start.

### R1a validation evidence

- Representative inventory denominator: **1 source / 2 classes / 12 allUnits /
  6 terminalUnits**, with **6/6** outcome-ID parity and byte-identical tracked
  versus untracked output. The definition-expression fixture separately proves
  **1 / 3 / 10 / 2**, including three unowned implicit constructors.
- Collision matrix: same-named functions across sources, same-named nested
  functions/classes across lexical owners, static versus instance methods,
  get versus set accessors, and two legacy `<computed>` labels all receive
  distinct structural IDs. Two required ABI bindings sharing display label
  `same` receive distinct internal names and reject ambiguous reverse lookup;
  one explicit import alias resolves to its canonical final slot.
- Determinism: `/checkout-one` and `/different/checkout-two` produce identical
  IDs; reversing the caller input array preserves IDs/order; `a.ts` importing
  lexically later `z.ts` orders `z.ts` first, with disconnected sources tied by
  canonical key. Relocating both a project and an external declaration-library
  root preserves source IDs; exact resolved-dependency entries override syntax,
  checker-resolved external modules do not bind unrelated same-basename sources,
  duplicate final source keys fail, and numeric order/ordinal 10 sorts after 2.
- The #3520 identity, #3520 ABI, and R0 outcome suites passed **66/66**
  (**27** identity/provenance, **10** ABI invariants, and **29** R0 outcomes). The
  identity matrix snapshots exact timer/node:path/typed-Node-wrapper/
  process.stdin/Iterator R0 rows; proves raw/gc/standalone/WASI user
  class/member/function IDs and retained host-free-DCE support IDs; and keeps
  tracked/untracked host-free binaries stable. Removed DCE support units are
  target-absent and are not claimed as cross-target identities. The green
  focused matrix passed **93/93**. The separate known-base matrix passed
  **9/15**: its three existing #1983 type-index failures and three inline-small
  harness/expectation failures reproduce identically on the exact pre-branch
  base `d3d2454b`, so the combined nine-file result is **102/108** with no new
  failure attributable to this slice. #2138, #3529, and phase3c are green.
- `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run format:check`, and
  `pnpm run check:loc-budget` pass; compiler-driver identity anchoring lives in
  `src/compiler/ir-outcome-inventory.ts` rather than growing `src/compiler.ts`.
- `pnpm run check:ir-only -- --policy=hybrid`: **READY**, 37 terminal units,
  31 emitted, 6 typed Unsupported, 0 Invariants; existing labels/counts remain
  unchanged.
- `pnpm run check:ir-fallbacks -- --verbose`: pass, zero unintended,
  post-claim, or module-level increases.
- Full equivalence gate: **1,608 passing**, **35 known failures**, zero new
  regressions, and one existing baseline failure now passing; the baseline is
  intentionally unchanged in this identity-only slice.
- Cross-backend differential validation passed **29/29**.
- No local Test262 run was performed; neither
  `benchmarks/results/test262-run.log` nor
  `scripts/equivalence-baseline.json` is changed.

## File ownership and locks

The implementing agent owns the files listed in frontmatter for the duration
of R1. The expanded lock is deliberate: a repository audit found source-unit
string keys in AST lowering plans, imported/module binding plans,
promise-delay ownership, IR-first call graphs, analysis passes, overlay
finalization, and the external-backend adapter in addition to the initially named core
files. Lock `src/ir/nodes.ts`, every typed-reference consumer, the listed
passes/backends, and `src/codegen/index.ts` as one identity change. Do not split
those files across parallel developers.

New identity/ABI modules are preferred over growing `codegen/index.ts`.
Changes in codegen context are adapter plumbing only. R1 may thread identity
through backend-linear/external-backend contracts, but it must not change backend
ownership or lowering behavior; whole-program multi consumption belongs to R5
and shared backend conversion belongs to R8.

## Anti-vacuity tests

`tests/issue-3520-ir-unit-identity.test.ts` must prove all of the following:

1. Two source files with identical top-level function/class/global display
   names receive distinct IDs and ABI entries in deterministic source order.
2. Two same-named classes in different lexical scopes, and two anonymous class
   expressions, do not share `IrClassId`, field layout, constructor, or member
   entries.
3. `static m`, instance `m`, `get x`, `set x`, a private/computed member, and a
   top-level spelling that resembles the legacy synthetic key all inventory as
   distinct units. Supported units resolve to distinct slots; unsupported
   members still receive distinct terminal identities.
4. A lifted closure in each of two same-named parents and two monomorphization
   clones cannot alias in inline/mono maps. Reversing unrelated `Map` insertion
   order does not change canonical IDs or output ordering.
5. Imported/default/renamed aliases and inherited members resolve as explicit
   aliases to one canonical binding, while an accidental collision raises the
   stable ABI invariant.
6. The R0 ledger has exactly one outcome per `terminalUnits` record; nested and
   support records remain present in `allUnits`, resolve to a terminal owner,
   and do not change legacy display labels/histograms.

Run the collision tests alongside `tests/issue-1983-funcmap-collision.test.ts`,
`tests/issue-2138-multi-module-ir-overlay.test.ts`,
`tests/ir/inline-small.test.ts`, `tests/ir/phase3c.test.ts`, and the
multi-file equivalence suite.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `IrSourceId`, `IrUnitId`, `IrClassId`, and typed binding identities are
      the only keys for program-level IR semantics; display names are labels.
- [ ] Same display names across files/classes/lexical scopes and
      static-vs-instance/get-vs-set members cannot collide or overwrite an IR,
      pass, ABI, or concrete slot entry.
- [ ] One deterministic `ProgramAbiMap` inventories signatures, globals,
      imports, types, exports, aliases, classes, and synthetic support units in
      source order before R2 uses it for ownership.
- [ ] Inline, recursion, propagation, monomorphization, integration, and clone
      identity are keyed structurally; there is no `byName` last-wins behavior
      for source units.
- [ ] The legacy adapter is the only name-keyed compatibility boundary and
      rejects ambiguous reverse lookup.
- [ ] Selection, Prepared/Unsupported outcomes, direct-vs-IR routing, and body
      emission counts are unchanged in R1.
- [ ] Non-collision fixtures are emitted byte-for-byte identically across gc,
      standalone, and WASI. Collision fixtures match JavaScript runtime
      behavior and retain public export names.
- [ ] Existing fallback/adoption and R0 telemetry counts/labels retain parity;
      the new IDs add information but do not reclassify outcomes.

## Risks and mitigations

- **Public-name churn:** structural IDs could leak into exports or diagnostics.
  Keep display/export names as explicit ABI labels and byte-compare every
  non-collision fixture.
- **Nondeterministic IDs:** filesystem or `Map` insertion order could change
  binaries and baselines. Derive IDs from normalized source identity, lexical
  position, unit kind, and deterministic clone ordinals.
- **Adapter ambiguity:** a reverse name lookup can silently choose the wrong
  legacy slot. Require a unique structural owner and raise a stable Invariant
  on zero or multiple matches.
- **Late index shifts:** lazy imports/globals can invalidate numeric slots.
  Keep symbolic binding identities until the one planned finalization boundary and
  test late-import pressure.
- **Wide pass blast radius:** identity touches builders, passes, and codegen.
  Land the bounded commits with old/new telemetry parity after each step and
  keep routing unchanged throughout R1.

## Out of scope

- Creating `PreparedIrProgram` or moving preparation before body emission
  (#3521).
- Skipping any additional direct body, changing fallback policy, or removing
  `experimentalIR` / IR-first switches.
- Compile-once class/closure ownership (#3522), module init (#3523), or
  whole-program multi-source ownership (R5).
- Rewiring runtime families (R6), async policy (R7), linear consumption (R8),
  or deleting direct handlers (#3090/R10).

## Required completion evidence

Expected-green Commit 2 and R1 gates:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run tests/issue-3520-ir-unit-identity.test.ts tests/issue-3520-program-abi.test.ts tests/issue-2138-multi-module-ir-overlay.test.ts tests/ir/phase3c.test.ts tests/linear-integration.test.ts tests/issue-3161.test.ts --pool=forks --poolOptions.forks.singleFork=true --no-file-parallelism

```

Known-base control matrix, run separately against both the branch and its exact
pre-branch base:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run tests/issue-1983-funcmap-collision.test.ts tests/ir/inline-small.test.ts --pool=forks --poolOptions.forks.singleFork=true --no-file-parallelism
```

This control command is not expected green while the existing #1983 type-index
and inline-small harness/expectation failures remain. Completion requires the
exact test/failure set and diagnostics to match the pre-branch control, with no
new failure. Do not combine it with the expected-green command or report the
combined exit status as a green gate.

The PR report must include the source/unit/class/binding denominators, a
collision matrix, deterministic-order proof, old-vs-new telemetry diff, and
the byte-identity result for the non-collision corpus. A passing runtime sample
without distinct ABI IDs/slots is vacuous and does not close R1.
