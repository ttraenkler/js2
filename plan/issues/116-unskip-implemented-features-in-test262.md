# Issue 116: Unskip implemented features in test262 runner

## Summary

Many features in the test262 runner's `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES` set have since been
implemented. Removing them will unlock thousands of previously-skipped tests.

## Features to unskip

| Feature flag | Implemented in | Tests blocked |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| `generators` | #64 | 1,949 |
| `destructuring-binding` | #17 | 1,761 |
| `destructuring-assignment` | #17 | 47 |
| `class` | #6 | 1,303 |
| `class-fields-public` | #36 | 236 |
| `class-static-fields-public` | #36 | 23 |
| `super` | #35 | ~10 |
| `computed-property-names` | #65 | 271 |
| `default-parameters` | #49 | 140 |
| `rest-parameters` | #18 | ~50 |
| `spread` | #18 | ~50 |
| `arrow-function` | #11 | 11 |
| `for-of` | #4 | ~5 |
| `for-in` | #9 | ~5 |
| `let` | handled | 46 |
| `const` | handled | 8 |
| `template` | #13 | ~5 |
| `tagged-template` | #109 | ~5 |
| `object-spread` | #77 | 63 |
| `object-rest` | #77 | 211 |
| `optional-chaining` | #16 | ~20 |
| `nullish-coalescing` | #16 | ~20 |
| `Map` | #54 | 7 |
| `Set` | #54 | 13 |
| `async-functions` | #30 | 10 |
| `Promise` | #30 | ~5 |

## Approach

1. Remove each feature from `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES` in `tests/test262-runner.ts`
2. Run the suite — tests will now either pass, compile_error, or fail
3. For compile errors: create targeted follow-up issues
4. For failures: investigate and fix or add narrower skip filters

## Complexity

M — Mechanical removal + investigation of new failures.
