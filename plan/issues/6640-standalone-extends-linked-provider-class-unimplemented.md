# (#5383 S64, 2026-09-19) This slice adds a capability that did not exist on the
# standalone lane at all: `super(...)` through a linked-provider parent, plus the
# synthesized derived constructor and the heritage-arm recording that feed it.
# The three grown functions are the three existing decision points the new arm
# must be spliced into — `collectClassDeclaration` (heritage classification),
# `compileClassBodiesInner` (synthesized derived ctor) and `compileSuperCall`
# (explicit `super`). Splitting any of them is a refactor of long-standing code
# this change does not otherwise touch, and would make the diff harder, not
# easier, to review against the measurements in `## S64`.
# (#5383 S64, 2026-09-19) +69 in class-bodies.ts and +10 in context/types.ts are
# this change-set's own (both files measured at the branch base 4337265784:
# 4440 / 4832). The bulk of the new mechanism lives in the NEW leaf
# `standalone-dynamic-parent-class.ts`; what remains in the god-file is the
# three splice points listed under `func-budget-allow` plus their rationale
# comments, and the context field's doc comment. Restated HERE rather than left
# to #5383's grant because CI diffs the merge preview against `main`, where that

# #6640 — standalone `extends` across the provider link is unimplemented, not just buggy

## Target (S56 dispatch)

`test/built-ins/Temporal/PlainDate/compare/use-internal-slots.js` and the
`PlainDateTime` sibling. Both `class AvoidGetters(Date|DateTime) extends
Temporal.Plain(Date|DateTime) { get year() { throw new CustomError(); } ... }`
then assert `compare(one, two)` ignores the getters (uses internal slots).
Both fail on `aec4fe5ba2` (S54 head) with an uncaught non-`Error` object
(`String(e) === "[object Object]"`).

## Root cause (fully reduced, real provider, no speculation)

`class-bodies.ts::collectClassDeclaration`'s heritage-detection loop only
wires up a real parent (`parentClassName`/`parentStructTypeIdx`,
`classParentMap`) for an `Identifier` or `ClassExpression` heritage
expression that resolves to a LOCAL class declaration. A property-access
heritage into a linked provider namespace — `class S extends Temporal.PlainDate
{}`, exactly this test's shape — falls into the standalone/wasi `else` arm
that ONLY marks `ctx.classDynamicUnresolvedHeritageSet.add(className)` (added
by #6623/S36, for a narrower `getPrototypeOf` false-positive fix). No
construction, method-dispatch, or brand-check machinery exists for this shape
at all under `--target standalone`/`wasi` — the comment at that call site
says so explicitly ("has NO standalone/wasi handling at all").

Consequence, confirmed by direct probes against the real
`@js-temporal/polyfill` provider (`.tmp/s56/repro3.js`, `JS2WASM_TEMPORAL_CACHE=s56-1`):

```js
class AvoidGettersDate extends Temporal.PlainDate {}
const one = new AvoidGettersDate(2000, 5, 2);
one.toString()   // "[object Object]" — NOT the inherited PlainDate.prototype.toString
one.year         // undefined — NOT even a throw; the getter never fires, plain miss
Temporal.PlainDate.compare(new Temporal.PlainDate(2000,5,2), one)  // throws, e.constructor undefined
```

`AvoidGettersDate` compiles as a **fully independent root struct** with no
compiled relationship to `Temporal.PlainDate` whatsoever:

- `super(2000, 5, 2)` does not thread through to the provider's real
  `PlainDate` constructor — no internal ISO-date slot is ever installed
  (WeakMap-keyed or otherwise) for `one`.
- Method lookup does not walk up to `Temporal.PlainDate.prototype` — `one`
  has no inherited methods at all; `one.toString()` falls through to the
  generic `Object.prototype.toString`-shaped default (`"[object Object]"`).
- `one instanceof Temporal.PlainDate` is `false` (separately confirmed,
  `.tmp/s56/repro2.js`): `Object.getPrototypeOf(AvoidGettersDate) ===
  Temporal.PlainDate` is `false`, `Object.getPrototypeOf(AvoidGettersDate.prototype)
  === Temporal.PlainDate.prototype` is `false`. (`Object.getPrototypeOf(one)
  === AvoidGettersDate.prototype` IS `true` — the LOCAL, single-module part of
  class construction is fine; only the cross-module LINK is missing.)

The polyfill's `compare()` internally brand-checks its arguments (directly or
via `ToTemporalDate`'s "already a PlainDate" fast path) and, finding `one`
unrecognized, falls back to property-bag coercion — reading `.year`/`.month`/
`.day`, which the test's overridden getters throw from. The thrown
`CustomError` (a plain function, no `Error` prototype) propagates uncaught and
renders as `[object Object]` when the harness stringifies it. This is a
downstream SYMPTOM of the missing link, not a separate bug in `compare()` or
in `instanceof`'s dispatch (`compileInstanceOf`/`collectInstanceOfTags` in
`typeof-delete.ts` are working exactly as designed against the
`classParentMap`/`classTagMap` they are handed — those maps simply never
receive an entry for this heritage shape).

## Why this is bigger than an instanceof fix

Fixing only `instanceof` (e.g. by teaching `collectInstanceOfTags` to treat an
unresolved-heritage class as compatible with its resolved linked-provider name)
would make `one instanceof Temporal.PlainDate` answer `true` while `one` STILL
carries no real internal date slots and STILL has no working inherited
methods — the polyfill's `compare()` would then take its "already a
PlainDate" fast path and read `one`'s (nonexistent) internal fields, most
likely trapping or reading garbage rather than throwing the informative
`CustomError` it does today. A point-fix at the `instanceof` site would very
plausibly turn a clean, easily-diagnosed test262 `fail` into a `compile_error`
or a WasmGC trap — a worse regression than the status quo, in a family (`class
… extends <linked>`) already flagged as architecturally fragile by #6623's own
"Traps" section.

A real fix needs, at minimum:

1. **`super(...)` must construct through the provider's actual constructor**
   for the linked base, with `new.target` correctly identifying the LOCAL
   subclass (so the provider's own `NewTarget`-based prototype selection, if
   any, still resolves to `AvoidGettersDate.prototype`) — i.e. a standalone
   analogue of the JS-host `hasDynamicHostParent`/extern-class-parent path
   (`class-bodies.ts` L1120-1141), which is explicitly gated OFF for
   standalone/wasi today.
2. **Method dispatch must walk into the provider's real prototype object**
   for any member `AvoidGettersDate` does not itself declare — a
   cross-module `[[Prototype]]` chain that is presently nonexistent for this
   shape (confirmed above: `Object.getPrototypeOf(AvoidGettersDate.prototype)
   !== Temporal.PlainDate.prototype`).
3. **`instanceof`/brand-check compatibility**, once (1) and (2) exist to make
   it a TRUE statement rather than a compile-time convenience.

(1) and (2) are the actual load-bearing gap; #6623's own "Residual" section
already named a narrower, ADJACENT third mechanism (a `getPrototypeOf`
boundary-terminal fall-through gap for values returned from a method call on
an unresolved-heritage receiver) as out of scope for its own slice, for the
same reason: it needs its own synthetic-probe budget and is a different
mechanism than what that slice fixed. This issue's gap is one layer more
fundamental than that one — #6623 assumed a receiver whose STRUCTURE at least
resembles the linked class; here the receiver never gets a real Wasm-level
tie to the provider at all.

## Reduction artifacts

- `.tmp/s56/repro1.js` — `assert.sameValue(one instanceof Temporal.PlainDate, true)` fails (`false` vs `true`), isolates the brand-check symptom.
- `.tmp/s56/repro2.js` — full prototype-chain dump: confirms the LOCAL half of construction is correct (`Object.getPrototypeOf(one) === AvoidGettersDate.prototype` = `true`, `one.constructor === AvoidGettersDate` = `true`) and the CROSS-MODULE half is entirely absent (both static and prototype `[[Prototype]]` links to the provider read `false`).
- `.tmp/s56/repro3.js` — confirms no inherited method dispatch (`toString` gives the generic default, not the provider's) and no internal-slot construction (`one.year` is `undefined`, not a getter throw — the getter override itself never gets exercised on the direct-property-read arm, only inside `compare()`'s internal coercion path).
- Root-cause site: `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts`, `collectClassDeclaration`, the property-access/`else` heritage arm (~L1160), comment block "(#6623, #5383 S36)".
- Downstream consumers reading the (empty) `classParentMap`/`classTagMap` entries: `src/codegen/typeof-delete.ts::compileInstanceOf`/`collectInstanceOfTags` (confirmed NOT the bug — correctly report `false`/no-tag for a class genuinely unlinked).

## Why parked rather than attempted here

S56's dispatch budget (~2.5h tool time) is sized for a point defect, not a new
cross-module construction/dispatch capability. The fix surface here overlaps
directly with #6623's own explicitly-deferred residual (same file, same
heritage arm, same "no standalone handling at all" gap) and — per that
issue's own "Traps" section — this general area has already produced one
false-positive regression from an incomplete first attempt (the field-less
tag-collision bug #6623 itself fixed). A speculative narrow fix risks
trading a clean `fail` (informative `CustomError` propagation) for a WasmGC
trap or `compile_error` on this and any other test that constructs a
subclass of a linked provider class and then calls an inherited method or a
static method that brand-checks it — a MUCH larger blast radius than the two
target rows (Temporal ships dozens of `subclassing-ignored.js` /
`compare/*` / `equals/*` files with the identical `extends
Temporal.PlainXxx` shape).

## Suggested follow-up scope (for whoever picks this up)

Design + implement the standalone analogue of the JS-host
`hasDynamicHostParent`/extern-class-parent construction path
(`class-bodies.ts` L1120-1141) for a property-access heritage that resolves
to a LINKED PROVIDER class: a real `super(...)` → provider-constructor call,
a cross-module `[[Prototype]]` chain for both the constructor object and its
`.prototype`, and instance method dispatch that falls through to the
provider's prototype methods. This is the same shape #6623's Residual
section already flagged as a third, unreduced mechanism — worth scoping
together rather than as two separate slices, since both live in exactly this
heritage arm.

## S64 — implemented: `super(...)` threads through the provider, and the two target rows pass

Branch `issue-5383-standalone-temporal-s64`, base `4337265784` (S63 head =
PR #5987, S63 + `origin/main`).

### The mechanism, in five lines

A property/element-access heritage in a standalone LINK CONSUMER now makes the
class **externref-backed with a RUNTIME parent** — the representation
`class Sub extends Error` has used on this lane since #1366a. `this` is not a
consumer-side imitation of a provider instance: it **IS** the object the
provider's own constructor minted. The `super(...)` call — explicit, or the
synthesized derived constructor — evaluates the heritage EXPRESSION and hands
it to the existing dynamic `__native_construct_<N>` driver (#3981), whose
already-correct boundary arm asks the peer's `__js2wasm_link_callable_kind` for
[[Construct]] and forwards to `__js2wasm_link_construct` (#5383 S2f R12), which
runs the provider's own `<Name>_new` (#5383 S2g). Everything downstream then
follows by construction rather than by re-implementation: an inherited read or
method call on that receiver misses the consumer's own ladder and reaches the
established link `memberGet`/`methodCall` terminals exactly as a direct
`new NS.Base()` instance already did, and a value handed BACK to the provider
(`Temporal.PlainDate.compare(one, two)`) brand-checks as a real instance
because it is one.

### Files

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `src/codegen/standalone-dynamic-parent-class.ts` | NEW — the gate (`isLinkedDynamicParentHeritage`) and the emitter (`emitLinkedDynamicParentConstruct`), plus the full scope rationale |
| `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts` | three splice points: the heritage arm records the expression + marks the class externref-backed; `computeImplicitDerivedCtorPrefix` gives the synthesized ctor an `__arg{i}` forwarder arity from the observed `new S(…)` sites; `compileSuperCall` gets a head arm for a linked parent |
| `src/codegen/context/types.ts`, `context/create-context.ts` | `classLinkedDynamicParentExpr` |
| `src/codegen/standalone-link-boundary.ts` | export `isStandaloneLinkConsumer` (the gate's only new predicate; `peerNamespaces` stays private) |
| `scripts/compiler-boundaries.json` | inventory entry for the new leaf |
| `tests/issue-6640-link-extends-provider-class.test.ts` | NEW witness |

### The gate, and why the blast radius is what it is

`--target standalone`/`wasi` **and** the module consumes a wasm provider
(`peerNamespaces(ctx)` non-empty) **and** the heritage is a
property/element ACCESS. A standalone module with no linked provider — which
is every module in the byte corpus, and the provider modules themselves —
takes no new code path at all. Confirmed two ways: the Temporal provider
prewarm re-emitted **3,334,356 B, key `a11c84e556193459`, byte-for-byte the
S63 figure**, and the 84-file byte corpus answered `statusFlips=0 shaFlips=0`
across BOTH lanes (so the `gc` lane is byte-identical and standalone grew 0
bytes on unlinked input). No true-base re-run was needed: there were no sha
flips to attribute.

### Witness — revert-and-measure, both trees

`tests/issue-6640-link-extends-provider-class.test.ts`, run on the fix tree and
again with the four changed files file-copy-reverted to `4337265784`:

| probe | base | fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `new SubNs(5).a` | `undefined` | `5` |
| `new SubNs(5).get()` | `!called value is not a function` | `5` |
| `new SubNs(5).label()` | `!called value is not a function` | `base` |
| `new SubCtor().get()` (explicit `super(7)`) | `!called value is not a function` | `7` |
| `NS.Base.brandOf(new SubNs(5))` | `foreign` | `base` |
| `NS.Base.brandOf(new SubOwn(5))` | `foreign` | `base` |

All **11 controls identical on both trees**, including `new NS.Base(3).get()`,
`NS.Base.make().get()`, `new SubOwn(5).own()` (a subclass's OWN method still
dispatches), `new LocalDerived(4).two()` (local `extends` with `super.two()`),
and `Object.getPrototypeOf(new NS.Base(3)) === NS.Base.prototype`.

Against the REAL `@js-temporal/polyfill` provider (`.tmp/s64/probes/p1.js`,
`JS2WASM_TEMPORAL_CACHE=…/s64-{0,1}`) the same flip:

```
base: [year=undefined] … [cmp!TypeError: year is required]
fix:  [year=2000]      … [cmp=-1]
```

### Residuals — measured, not assumed

1. **`instanceof` against a provider-owned class object answers `false` across
   the link — for a DIRECTLY constructed provider instance too.** Measured on
   the base tree: `(new NS.Base(3)) instanceof NS.Base` is already `false`.
   So the subclass answering `false` is that pre-existing gap, not a new one;
   both facts are PINNED as controls in the witness so the claim stays honest.
   This is the remaining piece of #6640's own item (3).
   **RESOLVED by #6644 (S66, 2026-09-19)** — the own-property gate in
   `__instanceof_dynamic` now falls back to the linked peer for a
   provider-owned target. The two controls in this issue's witness are
   updated to `true` in that change-set.
2. **Unresolved-IDENTIFIER heritage is NOT covered** (`class MySubclass extends
   construct {}`, where `construct` is a function parameter — test262's
   `checkSubclassConstructorUndefined`/`NotCalled` shape). That arm is shared
   with every `extends <builtin>` spelling, whose representation
   `classBuiltinParentMap` already owns; widening it is a separate, separately
   measurable change.
3. **`super(...spread)` with a runtime-length spread** falls back to
   argument-evaluation-only (§13.3.7.1 order preserved, `this` left as-is).
   The fixed-arity driver cannot serve it; #5383 S34's `__native_construct_argv`
   driver is the follow-up.
4. **The subclass's own declared instance FIELDS are not installed** on the
   parent-minted object, and `Object.getPrototypeOf(instance) ===
   Sub.prototype` / `instanceof Sub` follow the externref-backed lane's
   existing bound (#1366a). Own declared METHODS do still dispatch (measured:
   `new SubOwn(5).own()` → `99` on both trees).
5. **A property-access heritage whose object is LOCAL** — `const ns = { C };
   class D extends ns.C {}` **inside a link-consumer module** — also takes the
   new path, because the gate is syntactic (the checker types a linked
   namespace member as `any`, so there is nothing to discriminate on). It still
   constructs correctly (the driver's `__class_construct_dispatch` arm owns a
   local class-object value), but `D` becomes externref-backed, so it inherits
   residual 4's bound. Before this change that shape had NO relationship to `C`
   at all, so this is a behaviour change inside an already-broken shape, and it
   cannot reach a module with no linked provider. The `E-linked` battery group
   is the one that would show it.
6. **`String(subclassInstance)` / `.toString()` still render
   `"[object Object]"`** against the real provider — a `toString`-specific
   consumer-side arm that claims the receiver before the link terminal. Not
   needed by any target row; unreduced.

### Target rows

| row | base | fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PlainDate/compare/use-internal-slots.js` | fail `[object Object]` | **pass** |
| `PlainDateTime/compare/use-internal-slots.js` | fail `[object Object]` | **pass** |
| `PlainDate/from/subclassing-ignored.js` | fail `SameValue(«null», «null»)` | unchanged |
| `Duration/from/subclassing-ignored.js` | fail `SameValue(«null», «null»)` | unchanged |
| `Duration/prototype/abs/subclassing-ignored.js` | fail `called value is not a function` | unchanged |
| `ZonedDateTime/prototype/add/subclassing-ignored.js` | fail `called value is not a function` | unchanged |

The four `subclassing-ignored` rows were **reduced and are a DIFFERENT
mechanism**, which is why they do not move (`.tmp/s64/probes/p2.js`, real
provider):

- `Temporal.PlainDate.from.apply(undefined, ["2000-05-02"])` returns **`null`**
  while the direct `Temporal.PlainDate.from("2000-05-02")` works
  (`getPrototypeOf(result) === PlainDate.prototype` → `true`). That is
  `Function.prototype.apply` on a provider-owned METHOD VALUE, and it is the
  FIRST assertion `checkSubclassingIgnoredStatic` makes — so both `from/*` rows
  die before any subclass is constructed. (The `«null», «null»` message is the
  #6623 residual where `String(<linked class>.prototype)` prints `"null"`; the
  two values genuinely differ.)
- The `abs`/`add` rows reach `checkSubclassConstructorUndefined`, whose
  `class MySubclass extends construct` is the IDENTIFIER heritage this slice
  deliberately excludes (residual 2). Their earlier sub-checks were verified
  working: `instance.constructor = null; instance["abs"]()` already answers
  correctly with `getPrototypeOf(result) === Duration.prototype` → `true`.

`Duration/compare/order-of-operations.js` (`RuntimeError: unreachable in
__apply_closure()`, the #6628 provider-owned-closure class S63 documented) is
**untouched by this change** — it is in the Duration family diff below at 0/0.

### Full battery — 3,684 files, ZERO `pass → fail` in every group

`.tmp/s64/battery/run-batch.mts` against the S63-head base TSVs, provider cache
`s64-1`. Every group `matched = <size>`, `missing = 0`:

| group | files | pass→fail | fail→pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PlainDate | 120 | 0 | **1** (`compare/use-internal-slots.js`) |
| Duration | 120 | 0 | 0 |
| PlainDateTime | 120 | 0 | **1** (`compare/use-internal-slots.js`) |
| ZonedDateTime | 120 | 0 | 0 |
| A (Object/keys, …) | 1250 | 0 | 0 |
| B (Proxy) | 205 | 0 | 0 |
| C (Object/getPrototypeOf, …) | 349 | 0 | 0 |
| D | 300 | 0 | 0 |
| E-unlinked | 300 | 0 | 0 |
| E-linked | 300 | 0 | 0 |
| **F-class** (class semantics) | **250** | **0** | **0** |
| F-methoddef | 100 | 0 | 0 |
| F-objproto | 150 | 0 | 0 |
| **total** | **3684** | **0** | **2** |

Four-family standalone Temporal score **457 → 459 / 480**: PlainDate 116 → 117,
Duration 108, PlainDateTime 116 → 117, ZonedDateTime 117. Whole-battery pass
count 3079 → 3081.

### Other validation

- **Byte corpus** (84 files × `gc` + `standalone`): `statusFlips=0 shaFlips=0`.
  The `gc` lane is byte-identical and standalone grew **0 bytes** on unlinked
  input; the Temporal provider re-emitted the identical 3,334,356 B artifact
  under the identical cache key. No sha flip existed to attribute, so no
  true-base corpus re-run was required.
- **Equivalence gate**: 22 failing / 1720 passing / 22 known-failures — the
  expected triple, no new regressions.
- **Witness sweep, Node 22 AND Node 25**: `tests/issue-66*.test.ts`
  `tests/issue-6484-*` `tests/issue-6493-*` → 46 files / 272 tests passed on
  both; `tests/issue-6617-*` `tests/issue-6622-*` `tests/issue-6623-*` → 3
  files / 26 tests passed on both.
- **Gates**: typecheck · loc-budget (merge-base AND `origin/main`) ·
  func-budget (both bases) · coercion-sites · oracle-ratchet ·
  speculative-rollback · issue-ids:against-main · `update-issues --check` ·
  issue-spec-coverage · lint · prettier · compiler-boundaries inventory ·
  dead-exports (green — the two `moved-runtime` complaints about
  `src/optimize.ts` / `src/runtime/platform-capability-adapter.ts` are the
  inherited red, unrelated to this change).
