# #338 -- Negative test support in test262 runner

## Status: in-review
The test262 runner skips all "negative" tests (tests expected to throw SyntaxError, ReferenceError, etc. during parse/compile). These 3,247 tests should be runnable by checking if compilation fails with the expected error type.

## Details

Test262 negative tests have YAML frontmatter like:
```yaml
negative:
  phase: parse
  type: SyntaxError
```

The runner should:
1. Parse the negative metadata from the test frontmatter
2. For `phase: parse` or `phase: early` — check if the TypeScript compiler or our compiler rejects the code
3. For `phase: runtime` — check if execution throws the expected error type
4. Mark the test as passing if the expected error occurs, failing if it does not

## Example tests
- `test/language/expressions/exponentiation/exp-operator-syntax-error-bitnot-unary-expression-base.js`
- Many strict-mode syntax errors, duplicate parameter names, invalid assignments

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Runner detects negative test metadata
- [ ] Parse-phase negative tests pass when compilation correctly rejects code
- [ ] Runtime-phase negative tests pass when execution throws expected error
- [ ] 3,247 previously skipped tests are now attempted
