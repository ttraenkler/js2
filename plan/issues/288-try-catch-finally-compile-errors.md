# Issue #288: Try/catch/finally compile errors -- complex patterns

## Status: in-review
## Summary
~40 tests fail in language/statements/try with compile errors. These involve try/catch with complex catch binding patterns, try/catch/finally with return values, or nested try blocks. The existing try/catch implementation does not handle all patterns.

## Category
Sprint 5 / Group A

## Complexity: M

## Scope
- Support catch with destructuring binding (`catch ({message})`)
- Handle try/catch/finally with return values in finally
- Support nested try/catch blocks
- Handle catch without binding (`catch { }`)
- Update try/catch compilation in `src/codegen/statements.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Complex catch binding patterns compile
- try/catch/finally with returns compiles
- At least 20 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Fixed two bugs in `compileTryStatement` in `src/codegen/statements.ts`:

1. **Finally block not running when catch body throws**: When a `finally` block exists alongside a `catch` clause, the catch body is now wrapped in an inner `try/catch_all` block. If the catch body throws an exception, the inner catch_all runs the finally statements and then uses `rethrow 0` to propagate the exception. The finally statements are also appended after the inner try (for the normal exit path).

2. **try/finally (no catch) not running finally on exception**: When a `try` has a `finally` block but no `catch` clause, a `catch_all` handler is now generated that runs the finally statements and rethrows the exception. Previously, finally was only inlined at the end of the try body, so exceptions would bypass it.

Both fixes properly handle break/continue stack depth adjustments for the additional try label levels.

### What worked
- The inner try/catch_all wrapping approach correctly handles rethrow semantics
- Break/continue depth adjustments for the nested try blocks

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- `compileTryStatement` function

### Tests
- 15 new tests in `tests/issue-288.test.ts` covering:
  - catch without binding (`catch { }`)
  - try/finally without catch (normal + exception paths)
  - nested try inside try/catch/finally blocks
  - try/catch inside for and while loops with break/continue
  - finally with exception path
  - complex nested try/catch/finally with rethrow
- All 13 existing try-catch tests still pass
