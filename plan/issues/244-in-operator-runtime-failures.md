# Issue #244: `in` operator runtime failures

## Status: done

## Summary

4 tests in `language/expressions/in/` fail at runtime. These tests check the `in` operator with comma expressions and property existence on built-in objects like `Number`. The current `in` operator implementation does compile-time struct field checking but does not handle dynamic property names or built-in object property lookup.

## Root Cause

The `in` operator compiles to a compile-time check of struct fields. But these tests use:
1. `"MAX_VALUE" in Number` -- checking properties on built-in constructors
2. Comma expressions in the operands: `(NUMBER = Number, "MAX_VALUE") in NUMBER`
3. Side-effect evaluation order requirements

The `in` operator needs to handle built-in object property lookup at runtime, not just struct field existence.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- `in` operator codegen
- Tests affected: 4 runtime failures

## Expected Impact

Fixes 4 runtime failures.

## Suggested Approach

1. For `prop in obj` where obj is a known built-in (Number, Math, etc.), check if the property name exists on the built-in's known set of properties at compile time
2. For comma expressions in `in` operands, ensure the comma operator side effects are evaluated before the `in` check
3. Return `true`/`false` as i32

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `"MAX_VALUE" in Number` returns true
- [ ] Comma expression evaluation order is correct in `in` operands
- [ ] All 4 `in` operator tests pass

## Implementation Notes

### Changes made
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: Enhanced `in` operator codegen in `compileBinaryExpression`:
  1. **Comma expression support**: Extract static key from comma expressions like `(x = y, "key")` and parenthesized comma expressions
  2. **TypeScript type system property checking**: Use `rightType.getProperty(staticKey)` and `ctx.checker.getApparentType()` to check property existence via the type checker, not just struct fields. This handles built-in constructors (Number.MAX_VALUE), prototype methods (valueOf, toString), and dynamically assigned properties.
  3. **Side effect evaluation**: When static key is known, still evaluate both operands and drop results to ensure comma expression side effects execute correctly
  4. **Comma expression on RHS**: Also check the last element of a comma expression on the right side for type resolution

### Tests added
- 3 equivalence tests in `tests/equivalence.test.ts`:
  - "known property is 'in' the object"
  - "valueOf is 'in' any object (prototype property)"
  - "toString is 'in' any object (prototype property)"

## Complexity: S
