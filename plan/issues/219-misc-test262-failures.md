# Issue #219: Misc test262 failures

## Status: in-review
## Problem
Several test262 tests were reported as failing:
- S12.11_A1_T1.js - switch statement string matching
- S12.9_A5.js - return statement edge case
- S12.2_A9.js - variable declaration
- S9.8_A3_T2.js - string concatenation
- S11.4.2_A4_T6.js - void expression
- S8.2_A3.js - null type
- S8.1_A2_T1.js - undefined type
- S11.11.1_A4_T4.js - logical-and
- S11.11.2_A3_T4.js - logical-or

## Analysis
All 9 tests were failing in the JSONL report (`benchmarks/results/test262-results.jsonl`)
from an earlier test262 run with "returned 0" errors. However, the latest vitest run
(`test262-2026-03-09T17-15-00.txt`) shows all 9 tests passing. They were fixed by
prior commits:
- `ae9707e` (statement edge cases #154, #162, #163, #164)
- `71259e0` (logical/ternary/void #155, #156, #157)
- `5818fd5` (concat/Math/compound-assign #158, #160, #161)

## Fix
- Added equivalence tests covering the patterns from these tests:
  - void expression with side effects
  - switch with multiple case values
  - return from nested if blocks
  - logical-and with numeric operands (short-circuit value return)
  - logical-or with numeric operands (short-circuit value return)

## Tests
- 5 new equivalence tests in `tests/equivalence.test.ts`
