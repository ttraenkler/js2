# #189 — `new.target` meta-property: 7 compile errors

## Status: in-review
## Summary
All 7 non-skipped `new.target` tests fail to compile. The `new.target` meta-property is not implemented.

## Motivation
7 test262 compile errors in `language/expressions/new.target`. `new.target` refers to the constructor that was invoked with `new`. Inside a function called with `new`, it equals the function; otherwise it's undefined.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — MetaProperty AST node handling
- Need to track whether current function was called via `new`

## Complexity
M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `new.target` inside constructor returns the constructor reference
- [x] `new.target` outside constructor returns undefined
- [ ] 7 test262 compile errors fixed

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added support for the `new.target` meta-property expression in the TypeScript-to-Wasm compiler.

### Approach
1. Added an `isConstructor?: boolean` field to `FunctionContext` in `src/codegen/index.ts`
2. Set `isConstructor: true` when compiling class constructor bodies
3. Added a `ts.isMetaProperty` handler in `compileExpressionInner` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`:
   - Inside constructors (`fctx.isConstructor === true`): emits `i32.const 1` (truthy value)
   - Outside constructors: emits `ref.null.extern` (undefined/falsy)

Since our Wasm compiler always calls constructors via the `ClassName_new` pattern (never as regular function calls), `new.target` inside a constructor is always truthy. Regular functions are never invoked via `new`, so `new.target` is always `undefined` there.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — added `isConstructor` field to `FunctionContext`, set it on constructor compilation
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — added MetaProperty handler in `compileExpressionInner`
- `tests/issue-189.test.ts` — 4 tests covering truthy/falsy behavior in constructors and regular functions

### What worked
- Simple approach of returning i32 truthy/falsy covers the common usage patterns (boolean checks in constructors)

### Limitations
- Does not return an actual constructor reference (would need first-class function references), so comparisons like `new.target === Foo` are not supported. This covers the vast majority of real-world usage.
