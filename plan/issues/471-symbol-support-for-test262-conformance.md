# #471 -- Symbol support for test262 conformance

1,485 test262 tests are skipped because they use Symbol in source code or require
Symbol.iterator / Symbol support.

## Breakdown
- 1,135 tests skipped: "uses Symbol in source"
- 258 tests skipped: "unsupported feature: Symbol.iterator"
- 92 tests skipped: "unsupported feature: Symbol"

## Scope
This is a large feature. Minimum viable implementation:

1. **Symbol.iterator** -- needed for for-of loops, spread, destructuring on custom iterables
   - Create a well-known symbol constant
   - Support `[Symbol.iterator]()` method calls
   - 258 tests directly unblocked

2. **Symbol primitive type** -- basic symbol creation and comparison
   - `Symbol()` and `Symbol('description')` constructor
   - `typeof sym === 'symbol'`
   - Symbol as property key (computed property names)
   - 1,135 + 92 tests potentially unblocked

## Approach
- Represent symbols as i32 IDs internally (auto-incrementing counter)
- Well-known symbols get fixed IDs (Symbol.iterator = 1, Symbol.hasInstance = 2, etc.)
- Symbol-keyed properties stored in a separate Map on objects
- Start with Symbol.iterator only for maximum test262 impact
