# #364 -- call/apply on arrow functions

## Status: in-review
15 tests use `.call()` / `.apply()` on arrow functions. Arrow functions have lexical `this` binding, so `.call()` and `.apply()` should not override `this`.

## Details

```javascript
var arrow = () => this;
arrow.call({x: 1}); // should return outer `this`, not {x: 1}
arrow.apply({x: 1}); // same
```

Arrow functions capture `this` from their enclosing scope. When `.call()` or `.apply()` is used on an arrow function, the provided `this` argument is ignored.

Implementation:
1. Detect when `.call()` / `.apply()` target is an arrow function
2. If arrow, ignore the thisArg and use the captured lexical this
3. If regular function, use the provided thisArg as normal

Depends on #121 (`.call()` / `.apply()` general support).

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `arrowFn.call(thisArg, ...args)` ignores thisArg
- [x] `arrowFn.apply(thisArg, args)` ignores thisArg
- [x] Regular function `.call()` / `.apply()` still works correctly
- [x] 15 previously skipped tests are now attempted

## Implementation Summary

### Root cause
Two bugs were found and fixed:

1. **`compileClosureCall` only handled local variables, not module globals**: Arrow functions declared at module level (e.g., `const add = (a, b) => a + b`) are stored in Wasm module globals (`global.get`), but `compileClosureCall` only looked in `fctx.localMap` (locals). When the variable wasn't found, it returned `null`, causing the entire call expression to be silently skipped. Fixed by also checking `ctx.moduleGlobals` and using `global.get` + `ref.as_non_null` for module-global closures.

2. **`.call()` / `.apply()` handler lacked closure-by-type-index fallback**: The regular call path (line ~8544) has a fallback that looks up closure info by the local variable's ref type index when `closureMap` doesn't have the name. The `.call()` / `.apply()` handler was missing this fallback, causing it to miss closures assigned from function returns. Added the same fallback logic.

3. **Removed overly broad test262 skip filter**: The filter `if (/\.\s*(call|apply)\s*\(/.test(source) && /=>\s*/.test(source))` skipped any test containing both `.call()`/`.apply()` and `=>`, which was too aggressive.

### What worked
- The existing `.call()` / `.apply()` infrastructure (thisArg dropping, synthetic call creation) was correct -- only the closure resolution was broken.
- Module-level arrow functions now work for both direct calls and `.call()` / `.apply()`.

### What didn't work / limitations
- Closures returned from functions (e.g., `const f = makeAdder(5); f.call(null, 10)`) still don't work because the return type gets coerced to `externref`, losing closure type information. This is a pre-existing limitation tracked separately.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- `compileClosureCall` (module global support), `.call()` / `.apply()` handler (closure-by-type-index fallback)
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- removed overly broad skip filter
- `tests/equivalence/arrow-call-apply.test.ts` -- new test file with 11 tests

### Tests
- 11 new equivalence tests all passing
- Net improvement: 16 previously failing equivalence tests reduced to 9 (some module-level arrow function tests were silently failing before)
