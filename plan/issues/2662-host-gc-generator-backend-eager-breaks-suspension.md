# #2662 — host (gc) generator backend is eager-buffered (architectural correctness gap)

Split out of **#1344** (2026-06-25, sd-2651) because it is **bigger than #1344**
and gates whether #1344's state-machine slices (S-B/S-C) move the conformance
dashboard at all.

## The gap

There are **two** generator backends:

- **Native lazy state machine** (`src/codegen/generators-native.ts`) — correct
  suspension semantics, but **standalone/wasi-ONLY** (`generators-native.ts:849`
  `if (!noJsHostTarget(ctx)) return false`).
- **Host runtime** (`src/runtime.ts`) — used in **default gc mode** — is an
  **EAGER-YIELD BUFFER**: it runs the **entire** generator body up front into a
  `buf: any[]` (runtime.ts:135), then `.next()` just drains the buffer.

The eager backend **cannot** implement lazy suspension, so it is wrong for every
observable that depends on when the body runs:

- side-effect timing (statement after a `yield` must not run until resumed);
- `.return()` / `.throw()` **interrupting** a generator suspended in a `try`;
- `finally` running on abrupt completion at the right time;
- infinite generators (eager buffer never terminates).

### Proof (verified, current `main`)

```ts
let se = 0;
function* g() { se = 1; yield 1; se = 2; yield 2; se = 3; }
g();            // create, NO .next() yet
// gc/host:    se === 3   (whole body ran eagerly — WRONG)
// standalone: se === 0   (correctly lazy)
```

## Why this gates #1344 (and any generator-conformance work)

The test262 conformance runner wraps every test in `export function test() { … }`
(`tests/test262-runner.ts:2370`, `wrapTest`). A test's top-level `function* g()`
therefore becomes a **generator nested inside `test()`**, and (for the
GeneratorPrototype tests, which have no class so their `var`s are NOT hoisted to
module scope) it **captures** the `test()`-local vars. A capturing nested
generator hits `generatorCapturesOuterScope` (`generators-native.ts:901`) →
**bail to the host EAGER path even under `--target standalone`.**

Verified: the wrapped `return/try-finally-within-try.js` keeps `var inTry`,
`var inFinally`, and `function* g()` all INSIDE `test()` (capturing), so it runs
on the eager host path in BOTH lanes. The conformance dashboard's
`runTest262File` defaults to gc/host (`scripts/runner-bundle.mjs:64253` — no
`target` arg). **So test262 generators are measured on the eager host path.**

⇒ Building the native state machine for catch / yielding-finally (#1344 S-B/S-C)
would move the dashboard by **ZERO** until this gap is closed, because the
measured path never reaches the native backend for these tests.

## Options (architecture decision — needs the lead / an architect)

1. **Make the native lazy path handle CAPTURES** (so a nested/capturing generator
   goes native instead of bailing to eager host). This re-routes the wrapped
   test262 generators onto the correct backend and is likely the highest-leverage
   single change — it may flip a large swath of generator tests at once AND
   unblock #1344 S-B/S-C. Scope: the native state struct currently has slots for
   `this` + own params only, not captures (`generators-native.ts:899-902`);
   capture support means materializing captured bindings as ref-cell fields in the
   state struct (the closure-capture pattern already used elsewhere).
2. **Make the host gc backend lazy** (a proper resumable coroutine in
   `src/runtime.ts` instead of the eager buffer). Large rewrite; the eager buffer
   was a deliberate simplification. Likely out of scope / lower leverage than (1).
3. **Measure conformance on the standalone lane for generators** — does not fix
   the gc correctness gap, and captured generators still bail to eager even under
   standalone, so this alone is insufficient.

**DECISION (lead, 2026-06-25): Option (ii)** — native-struct→JS-callable boundary
wrapper + in-module-only native selection + capture-materialization. The PoC
revealed the JS-host boundary blocker that makes a plain "Option 1" insufficient
on its own (a captured generator can still escape to JS). See the full
**ARCHITECTURE WRITEUP** section below for the verdict, the option (i)/(ii)/(iii)
reasoning, and the 3-lever cost model. Build DEFERRED (multi-session epic).

## Acceptance

- A capturing nested generator runs LAZILY (the side-effect-timing proof above
  returns 0 in gc mode, or the wrapped test262 generators are routed to the
  native lazy path), without regressing the existing generator suites.
- Re-measure the GeneratorPrototype `return`/`throw` buckets afterward; #1344
  S-B/S-C then have a measurable target.

## Routing

Architecture decision first (lead/architect): option 1 vs 2 vs 3. Then a
senior-dev build. Blocks #1344 S-B/S-C from moving the dashboard.

# ARCHITECTURE WRITEUP (2026-06-25, sd-2651) — DECISION + PoC verdict + cost model

> This section is the durable spec a future session builds from. The build is
> **DEFERRED** (multi-session epic); the design is settled here. **DECISION
> (lead): Option (ii)** — native-struct→JS-callable boundary wrapper +
> in-module-only native selection + capture-materialization. Reasoning below.

## PoC verdict (env-gated probe `JS2WASM_POC_GC_NATIVE_GEN`, reverted — no commit)

Flipping `noJsHostTarget` (`generators-native.ts:110`) to also return true for gc
routed gc-mode generators to the native lazy backend. Three findings, in order of
how they reshape the design:

1. **Routing gc→native is trivial to ENABLE and works for the simple case.** A
   non-capturing top-level generator in gc mode became lazy
   (`function* g(){ se=1; yield 1; … }; g()` → `se===0`, was `3` eager) and
   emitted the native resume function (`__gen_resume_`). So the gate is the only
   thing standing between gc and the native path *for the simple shape*.

2. **Capturing generators still bail** (`generatorCapturesOuterScope`,
   `generators-native.ts:~901`) → eager host. The wrapped test262 shape (a
   `function* g()` nested in `export function test()` capturing the test-locals)
   needs capture-materialization (Lever A) OR runner-side hoist (Lever B) to reach
   native at all.

3. **THE BLOCKER — routing gc→native breaks the JS-HOST BOUNDARY.** The native
   path returns an **opaque Wasm state struct**, not a JS-callable generator
   object. Existing gc generator unit tests fail with **`gen.next is not a
   function`** (5 failures across `generators`/`generator-methods`/
   `generator-nested`/`for-of-generator`) the moment a native generator is handed
   **back to JS** (`const gen = exports.count(); gen.next()`). The native `.next`/
   `.return`/`.throw` are reached only via **in-module dispatch** (the
   `tryCompileNativeGeneratorMethodCall` path), never as JS methods on the struct.

### The decisive distinction (drives the whole design)

- **In-module generator use** (the wrapped test262 `test()` calls `it.next()`
  *inside* Wasm; standalone programs) → native lazy backend is CORRECT and is what
  we want everywhere.
- **JS-escaping generator use** (a gc program returns a generator to a JS caller,
  or host-side `for…of` drives it) → needs a **JS-callable object**, which today
  only the eager host runtime provides.

A global gc→native flip is therefore WRONG: it silently breaks every escaping
generator. Native must be selected only when the generator provably stays
in-module, **or** the native struct must be wrapped in a JS-callable object at the
Wasm↔JS boundary.

## Why Option (ii), not (i) or (iii) (lead decision)

- **(i) Keep gc eager; measure generators on the standalone+native lane.** Only
  moves the STANDALONE report, not the headline gc dashboard; leaves real gc-mode
  generators broken; and introduces a measurement-integrity wrinkle (generators
  scored on a different lane than the rest of the dashboard). Rejected.
- **(iii) Make the host gc runtime lazy** (resumable coroutine in `src/runtime.ts`
  instead of the eager `buf`). A large rewrite duplicating the state-machine the
  native backend already has. Rejected (lower leverage; two lazy engines).
- **(ii) native-struct→JS-callable wrapper + in-module-only native selection +
  capture-materialization.** Fixes the gc correctness gap broadly (escaping AND
  in-module), moves the headline dashboard, and reuses the one correct lazy engine
  (native). **CHOSEN.** Multi-session epic; build deferred, design captured here.

## 3-lever cost model (build order for the epic)

| Lever | What | Cost | Notes / prerequisite |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **JS-boundary wrapper** (PREREQUISITE) | Wrap the native state struct in a JS-callable object exposing `.next/.return/.throw/[Symbol.iterator]` that forward into the in-module native dispatch helpers; emit it at the Wasm↔JS boundary when a native generator value escapes to JS (return value, export, host `for…of`). Equivalently/additionally: an **in-module-only native selection** gate so a generator that never escapes JS takes native, while an escaping one either gets the wrapper or stays host. | **High (architectural)** | The genuinely new design piece. Decides escape analysis (which generators escape to JS) + the externref wrapper object shape. Reuses `tryCompileNativeGeneratorMethodCall` dispatch as the wrapper's forwarding target. Without it, gc→native breaks escaping generators (PoC finding 3). |
| **Lever A — capture-materialization** | Make `generatorCapturesOuterScope` NOT bail; materialize captured bindings as **ref-cell fields** (`struct (field $value (mut T))`) in the native state struct, shared with the enclosing scope's locals (the existing closure-capture pattern). Thread the ref-cells into the generator factory call; read/write through them in the resume function. | **High (multi-day)** | Bounded by the existing closure-capture machinery, but touches the state-struct layout (`registerNativeGenerator` ~:1094-1135), the factory call, and the resume emitter. Required because the wrapped test262 generators all capture. Needs the boundary wrapper first (a captured generator can still escape). |
| **Lever B — runner-side hoist** | In `tests/test262-runner.ts` `wrapTest`, hoist a test's top-level `function* g` + the `var`s it references to **module scope** (outside `export function test()`), so it is not captured → with gc→native it goes native. | **Low** | CHEAPER but: (a) still needs the gc→native routing + boundary-wrapper decision; (b) changes WHAT is measured — must preserve test semantics (hoist order, TDZ); (c) only helps the conformance lane, not real gc-mode generator correctness. A measurement convenience, NOT a substitute for Levers A + wrapper. Use only to *accelerate dashboard signal* once the core lands. |

**Build order:** JS-boundary wrapper (+ in-module-only selection) → Lever A
(captures) → re-measure GeneratorPrototype buckets → unblock #1344 S-B/S-C
(yielding finalizers, try/catch state decomposition). Lever B optionally bolted on
to speed the conformance signal, with semantics-preservation review.

## Loci (current `main`, for the builder)

- `src/codegen/generators-native.ts:110` `noJsHostTarget` — the gc/standalone gate.
- `:~839` `isNativeGeneratorCandidate` (gates on `noJsHostTarget`) +
  `:~901` `generatorCapturesOuterScope` (the capture bail — Lever A).
- `:~1094-1135` `registerNativeGenerator` state-struct field layout (add capture
  ref-cell fields here).
- `:~1448-1481` resume-function mode handling (mode 1 = `.return` abrupt;
  #1344 S-B adds mode 2 = `.throw` + deferred-throw-through-yielding-finally).
- `tryCompileNativeGeneratorMethodCall` (`:~1992`) — the in-module dispatch the
  JS-boundary wrapper must forward into.
- Call-site double-gates that also block gc→native:
  `declarations.ts:~848`, `class-bodies.ts:~1073`, `literals.ts:~2409`,
  `nested-declarations.ts:~377` (each `(ctx.standalone || ctx.wasi) && …`).
- `src/runtime.ts:~135` — the eager host generator `buf` (option (iii)'s target;
  NOT chosen, listed for completeness).
- `tests/test262-runner.ts:~2370` `wrapTest` — wraps every test in
  `export function test()` (the capture source); Lever B edits here.

## Status

Design settled (Option ii). Build DEFERRED — multi-session epic, to be prioritized
against s66 work with this spec in hand. **#1344 stays parked behind this epic**
(`#1344 depends_on [1665, 2662]`).
