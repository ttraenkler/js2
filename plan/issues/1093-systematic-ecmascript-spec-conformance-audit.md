# #1093 — Systematic ECMAScript spec conformance audit

## Summary

Perform a structured review of js2wasm's compiled output semantics against
the authoritative ECMAScript specification at https://tc39.es/ecma262/.
The goal is to identify places where our codegen, runtime, or type-coercion
paths deviate from the spec's Abstract Operations, producing wrong output
that test262 catches but we haven't root-caused to a specific spec section.

Currently 11,545 tests (54.9% of failures) are in the "wrong_output"
bucket — the compiler produces code that runs but gives the wrong answer.
Many of these aren't missing features; they're subtle semantic mismatches
against the spec. This issue structures the audit to systematically find
and file those mismatches.

## Motivation

Our current approach is reactive: test262 fails → we read the test → we
guess the spec rule → we fix the codegen. This works for obvious cases but
misses systemic patterns where many tests fail for the same underlying
spec-deviation. A structured spec-first audit inverts the loop: read the
spec section → check our implementation → identify the gap → file targeted
issues with spec-section references.

This is especially valuable for:
- Abstract Operations (§7) that many language features depend on
- The Property Descriptor model (§6.2.6) that Object/Array/Function all use
- The Iterator Protocol (§7.4) that for-of/spread/destructuring all use
- The Promise Job queue (§27.2) that async/await depends on

## Audit scope

### Phase 1 — Abstract Operations (highest leverage, broadest impact)

Review the following Abstract Operations against our implementation in
`src/codegen/type-coercion.ts`, `src/runtime.ts`, and `src/codegen/expressions/`:

| Spec section | Abstract Operation | Our path | Est. gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| §7.1.1 | ToPrimitive | `__to_primitive` / type-coercion.ts | #1090 (161 FAIL) |
| §7.1.2 | ToBoolean | `__to_boolean` / i32 coercion | small |
| §7.1.3 | ToNumber | `__unbox_number` / f64 coercion | partial (#1023) |
| §7.1.4 | ToInteger (→ ToIntegerOrInfinity) | f64 truncation | unknown |
| §7.1.17 | ToString | `__to_string` / string coercion | small |
| §7.1.18 | ToObject | `__to_object` / host bridge | unknown |
| §7.2.1 | RequireObjectCoercible | null/undefined guards | #820 umbrella |
| §7.2.3 | IsCallable | function type check | #1092 (69 FAIL) |
| §7.2.4 | IsConstructor | new-target check | #1092 adjacent |
| §7.2.10 | SameValue | `===` / ref.eq | #1065 adjacent |
| §7.2.11 | SameValueZero | Map/Set key comparison | unknown |
| §7.3.2 | Get (O, P) | `__extern_get` | large surface |
| §7.3.4 | Set (O, P, V, Throw) | `__extern_set` | frozen/sealed gap |
| §7.3.9 | DefinePropertyOrThrow | `__define_property` | #1018 (200 FAIL) |
| §7.4.1 | GetIterator | iterator protocol | #1016 (500+ FAIL) |
| §7.4.2 | IteratorNext | next() result shape | #1016 |
| §7.4.6 | IteratorClose | close on break/return | #1016 |

**Deliverable**: for each operation, a one-paragraph assessment of
"matches spec" / "deviates at step N" / "not implemented". File a
follow-up issue for each deviation found.

### Phase 2 — Property Descriptor model (§6.2.6)

Our Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor (#1018, 200 FAIL) and property
definition paths don't fully model the spec's Property Descriptor
internal record. Audit:

- §6.2.6.1 IsAccessorDescriptor
- §6.2.6.2 IsDataDescriptor
- §6.2.6.3 IsGenericDescriptor
- §6.2.6.4 FromPropertyDescriptor
- §6.2.6.5 ToPropertyDescriptor
- §6.2.6.6 CompletePropertyDescriptor
- §9.1.6 OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty
- §9.1.6.1 IsCompatiblePropertyDescriptor
- §9.1.6.3 ValidateAndApplyPropertyDescriptor

**Deliverable**: assessment of which property descriptor operations are
implemented vs stubbed vs missing. This gates Array.prototype method
correctness, Object.freeze/seal, and Reflect.*.

### Phase 3 — Execution Context and Environment Records (§9.1, §9.4)

Our closure/scope model uses WasmGC structs with ref-cell captures. Audit
against:

- §9.1 Environment Records (Declarative, Object, Function, Global, Module)
- §9.4.3 Function Environment Records — `this` binding, `super` binding
- §9.4.4 Global Environment Records — global `var` vs `let` hoisting
- §10.2 ECMAScript Function Objects — [[Call]] vs [[Construct]]
- §10.3 Built-in Function Objects — length, name, prototype properties

**Deliverable**: gap analysis of scope/this/super semantics. This
underpins the large language/expressions + language/statements wrong_output
buckets (5,816 tests combined).

### Phase 4 — Specific built-in conformance (targeted)

For each built-in category with >200 wrong_output tests:
- **Array** (1,100): audit §23.1 against `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`
  Array method dispatch
- **Object** (1,432): audit §20.1 against our property/prototype model
- **String** (280): audit §22.1 against string method implementations
- **RegExp** (223): audit §22.2 against our host-mode RegExp bridge
- **Function** (201): audit §20.2 against function object properties
- **Date** (191): audit §21.4 against our Date bridge

**Deliverable**: per-category deviation list with spec section + test262
failure count + issue cross-reference.

## Process

1. **One phase at a time.** Phase 1 first (Abstract Operations) because
   every other phase depends on them. Filing follow-up issues as found.
2. **Read the spec section, then grep our codebase for the operation name.**
   The spec uses camelCase names (`ToPrimitive`, `GetIterator`) that our
   code often mirrors (`__to_primitive`, `getIterator`). Where they don't
   match, the gap is itself a finding.
3. **For each deviation found**: file a new issue with the spec section
   reference (e.g. "§7.1.1 step 5 — we skip the exoticToPrim check"),
   the affected test count (grep test262-current.jsonl), and a fix sketch.
4. **Use the spec's algorithm step numbers** in issue descriptions so
   reviewers can verify the fix matches the spec precisely.
5. **Don't fix inline** — this is an audit, not a refactor. File issues
   and let devs pick them up in the normal sprint queue.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Phase 1 audit complete: all 17 Abstract Operations in the table
      assessed, deviations filed as issues
- [ ] Phase 2 audit complete: Property Descriptor model gap analysis
      written
- [ ] Phase 3 audit complete: scope/this/super gap analysis written
- [ ] Phase 4 audit complete: per-category deviation lists for the 6
      built-in categories
- [ ] All findings filed as individual issues with spec-section
      references
- [ ] Audit report committed to
      `plan/log/investigations/spec-conformance-audit.md`

## Effort estimate

**L** — this is a multi-day investigation task. Each phase is independently
valuable and can be dispatched separately. Phase 1 alone (Abstract
Operations) should take ~4-6 hours and will produce the highest-leverage
follow-up issues. Phases 2-4 can run in parallel across multiple devs.

## Notes

- The ECMAScript spec is at https://tc39.es/ecma262/ — use the living
  standard, not a dated snapshot
- For built-in methods, the spec's step-by-step algorithms are the
  authoritative reference. Many of our "wrong output" failures are from
  skipping a single step (e.g. the RequireObjectCoercible check at the
  top of most Array.prototype methods)
- test262 tests are written to exercise specific spec steps. The test
  file's metadata (`description`, `info`) often references the exact
  spec section. Use that as a cross-reference when auditing.
- This audit complements the reactive test262 error analysis by providing
  a spec-first view that catches gaps test262 hasn't surfaced yet
