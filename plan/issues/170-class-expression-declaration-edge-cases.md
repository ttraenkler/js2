# #170 — Class expression/declaration edge cases

## Problem
Class expressions inside function bodies (`var C = class { ... }; new C()`) failed with "Unsupported new expression for class: __class" because `collectDeclarations` only scanned top-level statements, missing class expressions defined inside function bodies.

## Fix
Modified `collectDeclarations` and `compileDeclarations` in `src/codegen/index.ts` to recursively scan function body statements for class expressions. Added `collectClassesFromStatements` helper that walks into function bodies to find and register class expressions.

## Tests unblocked
Class expressions defined inside functions now compile and instantiate correctly. Many test262 class expression tests still fail due to other limitations (computed property access, eval, etc.), but the fundamental "class in function" pattern works.

## Status: Done
## Complexity: S
