# #512 -- RuntimeError: illegal cast (~683 FAIL)

## Status: ready

683 tests compile successfully but fail at runtime with `RuntimeError: illegal cast`. This is a `ref.cast` instruction encountering a value whose runtime GC type does not match the expected struct/array type. Previously estimated at 65 -- the actual count is 10x higher.

### Root cause

The compiler emits `ref.cast` when narrowing a general reference (e.g., `anyref` or a union type) to a specific struct type. At runtime, the actual value is a different struct type (or a primitive boxed differently). Common scenarios:

1. **Object literal cast to wrong struct**: Object created with one shape but cast to another struct type
2. **Class hierarchy cast**: Subclass instance cast to parent struct type that doesn't match the WasmGC type hierarchy
3. **Generator/async-generator**: Iterator result objects have a different struct layout than expected
4. **Compound assignment**: Intermediate values have unexpected types during compound operations

### Fix approach

- Audit `ref.cast` emission sites in expressions.ts
- Add runtime type checks before casts (use `ref.test` + branch)
- Consider using `br_on_cast` for safe type narrowing
- For generators, ensure iterator result structs match expected types

### Coordinates with
- #442 (illegal cast -- original small issue, now subsumed)
- #401 (Wasm validation umbrella)

### Files to modify
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- cast emission, type narrowing
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- struct type registration
