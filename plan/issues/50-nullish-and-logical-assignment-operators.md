# Issue 50: Nullish and logical assignment operators

## Summary

Support compound assignment operators `??=`, `||=`, and `&&=`.

## Current behavior

`??` (nullish coalescing) and `||` / `&&` are supported as expressions,
but the compound assignment forms are not.

## Desired behavior

```ts
let a: number | null = null;
a ??= 5;   // a = 5

let b = 0;
b ||= 10;  // b = 10

let c = 1;
c &&= 2;   // c = 2
```

## Implementation

### Codegen (`expressions.ts` or `statements.ts`)
- Handle `BinaryExpression` with `??=`, `||=`, `&&=` tokens
- Desugar to: `a = a ?? rhs`, `a = a || rhs`, `a = a && rhs`
- Reuse existing `??`, `||`, `&&` compilation logic
