# #402 — Negative tests: expected SyntaxError (434 FAIL)

## Status: in-progress

434 tests expect a parse/early SyntaxError but our compiler successfully compiles them. These are test262 negative tests that verify the engine rejects invalid syntax.

## Details

These tests contain intentionally invalid JavaScript/TypeScript that should be rejected at parse or early compilation time. Examples:

- Duplicate parameter names in strict mode
- `break`/`continue` outside of loops
- Invalid left-hand side in assignment
- Duplicate `__proto__` in object literal
- Octal literals in strict mode
- `delete` on unqualified identifier in strict mode
- Labels on declarations

### Root cause

The `shouldSkip` function in test262-runner.ts was filtering out negative tests BEFORE they reached `handleNegativeTest`. Many negative tests intentionally contain patterns like `eval(`, `with(`, `delete `, etc. that `shouldSkip` matches. Since negative parse tests EXPECT compilation to fail, they should be attempted (not skipped).

### Fix

Move the negative parse/early/resolution test check BEFORE `shouldSkip` in `runTest262File`. This ensures:
- Tests that fail compilation are correctly classified as PASS
- Tests that succeed compilation are classified as FAIL (compiler too lenient)
- Either way, no false "skip" classification

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Negative parse/early/resolution tests are processed before shouldSkip
- [x] Compilation error = PASS for negative tests
- [x] No regressions in positive tests
