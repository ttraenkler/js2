# #588 — Finally block executes 2-3 times instead of once

## Status: in-review
When both `catch` and `finally` exist, the finally block instructions are inlined at:
1. End of try body (statements.ts:3629)
2. Inside inner try's catch_all (3699-3700)
3. After the inner try (3719-3720)

JavaScript semantics require finally to run exactly once. Duplicating instructions causes side effects (mutations, I/O) to execute multiple times.

## Fix

Compile the finally body once into a pre-compiled instruction array, then deep-clone it
(via JSON.parse/JSON.stringify) into each insertion point. This ensures:
- The TS statements are compiled only once (avoiding compilation side-effects)
- Each control-flow path gets its own independent copy of the instructions
- The runtime behavior remains correct: only one path executes at runtime

Note: The original code was actually semantically correct at runtime -- the 2-3 copies are in
mutually exclusive control flow paths (normal try exit, catch-then-normal-exit, catch-then-rethrow).
However, compiling the same TS statements multiple times is wasteful and could lead to subtle
inconsistencies if compilation has side effects on the FunctionContext state.

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Pre-compile the finally block body once into an instruction array before building the try structure
- Use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` deep cloning to create independent copies for each insertion point
- Reduced finally compilation from 2-5 `compileStatement` calls to exactly 1

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- `compileTryStatement` function

### Tests
- Added `tests/finally-duplicate.test.ts` with 7 test cases covering:
  - Finally on normal path (no exception)
  - Finally with catch handling exception
  - Finally on normal path with catch clause present
  - Finally mutation correctness on both normal and exception paths
  - Try-finally without catch
  - Multi-statement finally blocks
- All existing try-catch tests continue to pass
