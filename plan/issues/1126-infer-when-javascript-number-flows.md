# #1126 — Infer when JavaScript number flows can be safely lowered to int32 or uint32

## Problem

The compiler already has several ways to emit `i32` in specific cases:

- explicit bitwise coercions such as `|0`
- builtin-specific lowerings such as `Math.clz32` / `Math.imul`
- legacy fast-mode heuristics

But there is no principled pass covering the broader question:

- when can a JavaScript `number` flow stay in a narrower integer domain
- when is that domain signed `int32`
- when is that domain effectively `uint32`
- when must the compiler widen back to full JS `number` / `f64`

Right now that decision is made piecemeal. As a result:

- some hot numeric paths stay in `f64` longer than necessary
- some optimizations are limited to explicit coercion syntax instead of proven
  numeric facts
- there is no single place to define the safety rules for `i32` vs `u32`
  lowering under JavaScript semantics

Issue `#1124` established that this reasoning does not fit cleanly in the
current AST-to-Wasm lowering path and should live in a proper middle-end.
This issue tracks the integer-domain part of that work.

## Why it matters

- hot loops and counters should not bounce through `f64` if the value domain is
  provably integral
- array/string lengths, indices, shift counts, hashes, and bitwise pipelines
  often naturally live in 32-bit integer domains
- unsigned flows matter for JavaScript operations such as `>>>`, `Math.clz32`,
  `Math.imul`, and index/length-style arithmetic
- fixes the root cause of the saturation bug tracked in #1236

## Goal

Define and implement a conservative inference pass that detects when JS
`number` values can safely be represented as:

- signed `int32`
- unsigned `uint32`

and keeps those values in an integer domain until a real semantic boundary
requires widening back to JS `number` / `f64`.

## Scope

This issue is broader than explicit `|0` patterns. It should cover:

1. inference from operations and value flow
2. distinction between signed and unsigned 32-bit domains
3. safe widening points back to generic JS number semantics
4. interaction with call boundaries, returns, closures, and loops

This issue does **not** need to solve arbitrary numeric range analysis or
perfectly infer all integer domains in dynamic JavaScript.

## Required questions

The implementation or design must answer:

1. Which operations constrain a value to `int32`?
2. Which operations constrain a value to `uint32`?
3. Which operations force widening back to generic JS number / `f64`?
4. When does "integral" still not imply safe `i32` lowering?
5. How should the compiler represent signed vs unsigned facts internally?
6. How do those facts propagate through loops, branches, and function calls?
7. At what boundaries must `uint32` be normalized back to JS number semantics?
8. How does this interact with existing explicit coercion syntax like `|0` and `>>> 0`?

## First-pass rules to support

Support at minimum:

- integer literals
- loop counters
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `%` when both operands are already in an integer domain and
  JS semantics are still preserved
- bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`
- comparisons and branch conditions
- array/string lengths and indices
- builtin cases already known to be 32-bit-oriented

Conservatively widen on: `/`, fractional literals, floating-point `Math.*`
operations, mixed integer/float flows, host/API boundaries.

## Desired architecture

Build on the middle-end direction from `#1124`:

- TypeScript checker provides initial facts
- middle-end IR tracks numeric-domain facts on SSA values
- a propagation pass refines values to `f64`, `int32`, or `uint32`
- Wasm lowering materializes `i32` ops where the domain is proven safe
- boundary lowering inserts widening/coercion only where needed

## Acceptance criteria

- compiler distinguishes at least three states: `f64` | `int32` | `uint32`
- explicit `|0` and `>>> 0` patterns map into this framework (no isolated ad hoc handling)
- integer-domain facts propagate through simple loops and direct calls
- conservative widening on ambiguous semantics
- generated code for proven integer-domain hot paths is materially leaner than f64 path
- #1236 (saturation bug) is subsumed or explicitly tracked as out-of-scope
- design is consistent with the middle-end architecture proposed in `#1124`

## MLIR alignment

The integer-domain inference results **must be expressed as `TypeMap` entries**,
not as IR node mutations or ambient module-level maps. The `propagate()` contract
from #1231 applies here: a future MLIR optimizer that replaces the LatticeAtom
propagator must produce the same `TypeMap` shape, and the Wasm emitter is unchanged.

Concretely:
- The i32/u32 domain fact for a node is stored in the `TypeMap`:
  `typeMap.get(nodeId) → { numericDomain: "i32" | "u32" | "f64" }`.
- The Wasm emitter reads `typeMap.get(nodeId)?.numericDomain` to decide whether
  to emit `f64.add` vs `i32.add`.
- **Anti-pattern**: setting `node.inferredIntDomain = "i32"` on the AST node —
  that breaks MLIR replaceability. Route through `TypeMap`.

## Implementation Plan (architect-spec, 2026-05-03)

Author: senior-developer (Opus). Decomposed into six landable PRs so each
stage is independently bisectable and testable.

### Anchoring lessons from prior attempts

1. **#1236 — `i32 + i32 = f64` (NOT `i32`).** JavaScript's `+` on two
   safe-integer i32s can overflow into the safe-integer f64 domain
   (`2^31` fits in f64 mantissa; `i32.add` would wrap-around-trap). The
   correct rule: **arithmetic with both operands in `i32` widens the
   result to `f64`** unless the value is immediately re-coerced (`(a+b)|0`,
   shift, or stored to an `i32` slot). Bitwise / shift operators are the
   only ops that *preserve* the `i32` domain across arithmetic.
2. **#1231 contract.** The propagation pass writes ONLY into `TypeMap`.
   No `node.inferredIntDomain = "i32"` or sidecar maps keyed by
   `ts.Node`. MLIR replacement reads the same `TypeMap` shape.
3. **Selector-rejected functions stay legacy.** This pass adds two new
   `LatticeAtom` kinds (`i32`, `u32`); if propagation of those atoms hits
   a body the selector doesn't claim, fall back to `f64` for that
   function — never poison the legacy path with new domain facts.
4. **Bool already maps to `i32` Wasm.** `lowerTypeToIrType({kind:"bool"})`
   already returns `{kind:"val", val:{kind:"i32"}}` (line 920 of
   propagate.ts) — meaning `i32` as a *Wasm representation* exists today.
   What's missing is `i32` as a *lattice domain fact* for f64-typed
   values that happen to live in the integer subset.

### Domain semantics — what the lattice atoms mean

| Atom    | Wasm rep          | Domain invariant                                             |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `f64`   | `f64`             | Generic JS number — may be ±0, NaN, ±Inf, fractional         |
| `i32`   | `i32`             | Integer in `[-2^31, 2^31)`, signed two's-complement          |
| `u32`   | `i32` (unsigned)  | Integer in `[0, 2^32)`, treated unsigned at every op site    |
| `bool`  | `i32` (0/1)       | Boolean — already supported, untouched                       |

`i32` and `u32` share the **same Wasm storage type** but are tracked as
distinct lattice atoms because the *operations* differ (`i32.shr_s` vs
`i32.shr_u`, comparison signedness, conversion to `f64`).

### Stage 1 — Lattice extension (~150 LoC, 1 PR)

**File**: `src/ir/propagate.ts`

Extend `LatticeAtom` to:
```ts
export type LatticeAtom =
  | { readonly kind: "f64" }
  | { readonly kind: "i32" }   // NEW
  | { readonly kind: "u32" }   // NEW
  | { readonly kind: "bool" }
  | { readonly kind: "string" }
  | { readonly kind: "object"; readonly fields: ... };
```

Update:
- `join()`: `i32 ⊔ f64 = f64`, `u32 ⊔ f64 = f64`, `i32 ⊔ u32 = f64`
  (signed/unsigned mismatch widens — values like `2^31` differ in sign).
  `i32 ⊔ i32 = i32`, `u32 ⊔ u32 = u32`. Cross-kind with non-numeric
  atoms still produces `union` or `dynamic` per existing rules.
- `lowerTypeToIrType`: `i32`/`u32` both → `{kind:"val", val:{kind:"i32"}}`
  but **carry the signedness in the IR shape** (new field
  `IrValType.signed?: boolean`, default `true`). The signedness sticks
  to the value so emit sites pick `f64.convert_i32_s` vs `_u`.
- New constants `I32: LatticeType`, `U32: LatticeType`.

Tests: `tests/ir-propagate-i32.test.ts` — pure-unit tests of `join`,
`inferExpr` with literal/var/binop seeds, no compile.

**Acceptance**: lattice tests pass; no behavior change in any compile
test (no producers of `i32`/`u32` atoms yet).

### Stage 2 — Inference rules (~400 LoC, 1 PR)

**File**: `src/ir/propagate.ts` — extend `inferExpr` and `seedParamType`.

Producer rules (an op produces `i32`/`u32`):
| Source                                          | Domain |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Integer numeric literal in `[-2^31, 2^31)`      | `i32`  |
| Integer numeric literal in `[2^31, 2^32)`       | `u32`  |
| `e \| 0`, `e & X`, `e ^ X`, `e << X`, `e >> X`  | `i32`  |
| `e >>> 0`, `e >>> X`                            | `u32`  |
| `~e`                                            | `i32`  |
| `Math.clz32(e)`                                 | `u32`  |
| `Math.imul(a, b)`                               | `i32`  |
| `array.length`, `string.length`                 | `u32`  |
| Loop counter pattern: `for (let i=0; i<N; i++)` | `i32`  |
|   where `i` is integer-seeded and never widened |        |
| TS annotation `i32` / `u32` (from #939 native)  | `i32` / `u32` |

**Critical preserve/widen rules** (the #1236 fix):
| Op                   | Both sides | Result |
|----------------------|-----------|--------|
| `+`, `-`, `*`, `%`   | `i32, i32` | **`f64`** (overflow → JS number widening) |
| `+` (string)         | `string, *` | `string` |
| `&`, `\|`, `^`        | `*, *`    | `i32`  (JS ToInt32 forces narrow) |
| `<<`, `>>`           | `*, *`    | `i32`  |
| `>>>`                | `*, *`    | `u32`  |
| `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` | `i32, i32` | `bool` (cmp uses `i32.lt_s` etc.) |
| `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` | `u32, u32` | `bool` (cmp uses `i32.lt_u`)        |
| `==`, `===`          | numeric/numeric | `bool` |
| `/`                  | any       | `f64`  (always widen — fractional possible) |
| `**`                 | any       | `f64`  |
| `Math.{abs,sign,...}` | `i32`    | `i32`  (only safe when result domain proven) |
| `Math.{floor,ceil,round,trunc}` | `f64` | `i32` *if* in safe range, else `f64` (conservative: `f64`) |

This is the heart of the spec: **arithmetic widens, bitwise narrows.**
The pattern `(x|0) + 1` will infer `i32` for `(x|0)`, `f64` for the
`+1`, then if it's stored to a counter with a coerce-back at top of
loop (`i = (i+1)|0`), the loop body sees `i32` again.

Loop counter detection (the #1120 sub-pattern, lifted into propagate):
```ts
// In a `let i = K` declaration where K is i32-domain, and the only
// updates to `i` inside the enclosing block are `i = i + LIT` or
// `i++` / `i--`, AND the only loop-exit comparison narrows to i32-cmp,
// treat `i` as i32-domain across the loop body.
```
This requires light SSA-style tracking — implement as a per-function
flow pass on top of the existing scope walker.

Tests: `tests/ir-propagate-i32-rules.test.ts` — for each producer rule
and each preserve/widen rule, build a synthetic body, call `propagate`,
assert the resulting `TypeMap` entry's atoms.

**Acceptance**: TypeMap-shape tests pass; #1236 saturation repro now
infers `f64` for the accumulator (sentinel test stays passing).

### Stage 3 — Emitter integration (~500 LoC, 1 PR — biggest one)

**File**: `src/ir/lower.ts` (IR-claimed functions) +
`src/codegen/expressions.ts` (legacy fallback).

IR side:
- New `IrValType.signed?: boolean` field threaded through.
- `case "binary"` in `lower.ts:602` now consults each operand's
  `IrType.val.kind`. If both operands are i32-shaped:
  - bitwise/shift: emit `i32.{and,or,xor,shl,shr_s,shr_u}` directly
    (skip the JS-bitwise scratch dance at lines 610-648 — this is
    where the perf win shows up).
  - arithmetic: per the rule above, emit `f64.convert_i32_s/u` on
    BOTH operands, then `f64.add` / `f64.sub` / `f64.mul`. The
    propagated result type is `f64`. (No `i32.add` here — that's the
    #1236 trap.)
  - compare: emit `i32.{lt,le,gt,ge}_{s,u}` based on signedness,
    matching the JS comparison semantics (both `i32` → signed cmp;
    both `u32` → unsigned cmp; mixed → widen and `f64.lt`).
- Loop counter slots: when a `let` lowers to a local of `IrType.val.i32`
  (rather than `f64`), the local declaration emits `i32` instead.

Legacy side (for selector-rejected functions where TypeMap still has
i32 facts — e.g., recursion):
- `compileBinaryOp` reads `typeMap.get(node.id)?.numericDomain` and
  picks the same i32 fast path. **Anti-pattern guard**: if the legacy
  path can't reach `typeMap` (some emit sites don't have it threaded),
  fall back to `f64` — never silently miscompile.
- New helper `coerceToInt32(operand, signed: boolean)` in
  `type-coercion.ts` for the boundary cases.

Boundary materialization rule:
- An `i32`-domain value crossing into an `f64`-typed slot
  (param/return/closure-cap/struct-field): emit `f64.convert_i32_s/u`
  at the boundary. Track this via a `widenAtBoundary` flag in
  `LowerCtx`.
- An `f64`-domain value flowing into an `i32`-typed slot: emit the
  full JS `ToInt32` (the sequence at `expressions.ts:1989-2009`).

Tests: `tests/issue-1126-emit.test.ts` — equivalence-style tests for
each rule, comparing legacy vs IR output for hot kernels:
- bitwise loop (FNV-1a hash, CRC32, popcount)
- counter loop (sum 1..N)
- mixed (`(a+b) | 0` reductions)
- saturation guard (the #1236 case must still produce wrong-but-JS-correct
  f64 result, not i32-trapped value).

**Acceptance**: all equivalence tests pass; spot-check generated wat
shows `i32.and` / `i32.shl` instead of the scratch-local dance for
proven-i32 bitwise ops; #1236 saturation test stays green.

### Stage 4 — Boundary conversions & call propagation (~150 LoC, 1 PR)

**Files**: `src/ir/propagate.ts` (call-site arg/return narrowing),
`src/ir/lower.ts` (call lowering), `src/codegen/index.ts` (legacy).

- Function-param i32 facts already inferred by Stage 2's worklist now
  affect emit: if `f(x: number)` is inferred `params: [i32]`, the IR
  generates a function with an `i32` param, AND every call site
  narrows the f64 arg to i32 before the call.
- Return-type i32 facts: callee returns i32-Wasm, callers receiving
  into an f64 slot get a `f64.convert_i32_s` stub.
- Cross-function narrowing must be conservative: only collapse to
  i32 when ALL inferred call sites for that param land in `i32`/`u32`
  domain (otherwise widen). The existing worklist in `buildTypeMap`
  already monotone-joins; this just needs the new atoms wired in.

Tests: `tests/issue-1126-cross-fn.test.ts` —
- `function add(a, b) { return a + b }` called with `i32` args: param
  type stays `f64` (because i32+i32 → f64 in body).
- `function shl(x, n) { return x << n }` called with `i32` args: param
  type narrows to `i32`, return narrows to `i32`, all call sites pre-
  narrow.

**Acceptance**: cross-function tests pass; no test262 regression
(`Numbers/intrinsics` cluster is the high-risk path).

### Stage 5 — Tests + benchmarks (~300 LoC, 1 PR)

**Files**: `tests/issue-1126.test.ts`,
`benchmarks/perf-suite/int32-kernels.bench.ts`.

- Benchmarks for: FNV-1a hash, simple PRNG (xorshift32), matrix index
  arithmetic, loop counter sum. Compare wasm vs js wall-clock and IR
  vs legacy compile output bytes.
- Acceptance-criteria coverage tests (one per `## Acceptance criteria`
  bullet in this issue file).
- A `pseudo-extern` registry sweep test confirming `array.length` etc.
  produce `u32` atoms.

**Acceptance**: benchmarks recorded as new baseline; acceptance-tests
all green.

### Stage 6 — Peephole polish (~100 LoC, 1 PR)

**File**: `src/codegen/peephole.ts`.

- Eliminate `f64.convert_i32_s` immediately followed by JS-`ToInt32`
  sequence (round-trip).
- Eliminate `i32.add` followed by `f64.convert_i32_s` followed by
  `JS-ToInt32` when surrounded by an outer `|0` (composite collapse).
- Don't touch the #1236 widen path — peephole must not re-narrow what
  Stage 3 deliberately widened.

Tests: `tests/peephole-i32-roundtrip.test.ts` — synthetic Wasm
sequences, assert collapse.

**Acceptance**: peephole tests green; benchmark improvements visible
on hot kernels.

### Risk register & mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| `i32+i32 → i32` regression like #1236 | Stage 2 explicitly widens arithmetic to f64; sentinel test in #1236 stays as canary |
| Test262 `Number` cluster regression | Land Stage 1+2 alone first, watch CI; if any regression, hold stages 3+ until root-caused |
| Cross-fn worklist non-termination | Existing `MAX_ITERS = 50` cap covers this; new atoms are still on a finite lattice |
| Legacy/IR divergence on i32 slot types | All legacy emit sites that consult `typeMap.numericDomain` must default-to-f64 on missing entry |
| MLIR drift | Every lattice/TypeMap change goes through `propagate.ts`; downstream consumers read TypeMap shape only |

### Out of scope (for this slice — defer to follow-ups)

- `i64` / `BigInt` domain (separate issue)
- Range-narrowing (e.g., `i & 0xFF` known to fit in `i8`) — needs
  proper interval analysis, much heavier
- Dynamic-property numeric-key fast path (`obj[i32]` → typed array
  index) — interacts with object-shape inference, separate slice
- Loop-induction-variable strength reduction — `wasm-opt` already
  does most of this post-codegen; revisit if benchmarks show gap

### Total

~1,600 LoC across 6 PRs, sequenceable. PRs 1+2 are pure additions
(no behavior change without #3); PR 3 is the largest and the only one
that can produce a perf regression if the rules are wrong; PRs 4–6
are polish.

## Stage 3 implementation notes (senior-developer, 2026-05-07)

### What landed in Stage 3 (this PR)

1. **Lower.ts opportunistic i32 fast path** (the perf-dominant change).
   At the `case "binary"` arm in `src/ir/lower.ts`, JS-bitwise ops
   (`js.bitand`, `js.bitor`, `js.bitxor`, `js.shl`, `js.shr_s`,
   `js.shr_u`) now peek at operand IrTypes BEFORE emitting:
   - **Both operands i32** → emit native `i32.{and,or,xor,shl,shr_s,
     shr_u}` directly, skip the JS-ToInt32 scratch dance entirely. The
     result is converted back to f64 with `f64.convert_i32_*` to honour
     the `js.bit*` IR result-type contract.
   - **One operand i32, other f64** → skip ToInt32 only on the i32 side.
     This path is reachable in principle (`coerceToF64ForBitwise` and
     the rhs-is-i32 scratch-slot variant cover it correctly) but isn't
     hit by today's `from-ast.ts` because the matching-operand-type
     check at line 3206 rejects mixed types. Leaving the lowerer code
     in place lets a future Stage 4 boundary-conversion pass produce
     mixed-type bitwise IR without further lowerer changes.
   - **Both operands f64** → existing scratch-dance path, unchanged.

2. **Native i32 magnitude compares**. New `IrBinop` variants `i32.lt_s`,
   `i32.le_s`, `i32.gt_s`, `i32.ge_s`, `i32.lt_u`, `i32.le_u`,
   `i32.gt_u`, `i32.ge_u`. The AST→IR lowerer's `lowerBinary` now picks
   them when both operands of `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` are i32-typed. The
   signed/unsigned variant comes from operand `IrType.val.signed`
   (default `signed: true`); pure unsigned only fires when both
   operands are explicitly `signed: false` (`u32` lattice domain).

3. **From-ast.ts: relax `requireF64` for bitwise/shift**. The bitwise
   and shift operators now also accept matched-i32 operands (the same
   types the magnitude compares accept). The result type stays `f64`
   regardless — see the rationale below.

4. **Constant-folding update**. The new `i32.{lt,le,gt,ge}_{s,u}`
   variants got constant-folders in `src/ir/passes/constant-fold.ts`
   that match Wasm signed/unsigned compare semantics (`| 0` for signed
   sign-extension, `>>> 0` for unsigned bit-pattern reinterpretation).

### What I deliberately did NOT do, and why

The architect's spec proposes narrowing the bitwise op result type to
i32 when both operands are i32, so chains like
`(a & 0xff) | (b & 0xff)` would stay in i32 throughout. I tried that
first and discovered a contract bug:

```
function f(a, b, c, d) { return (a < b) | (c < d); }
```

TS infers the return type as `number` (the bitwise op coerces booleans
to numbers). So the function's Wasm return slot is `f64`. If the
bitwise op narrows to i32, the SSA value flowing into the return is
i32 — and the lowerer emits a bare `return` without auto-coercing,
producing an invalid Wasm module: "type error in return[0] (expected
f64, got i32)".

Fixing this properly requires implicit coerce-at-use-site for every
context that has a target IrType: returns, function-call args,
variable initialisers, field stores, etc. That's a Stage-4 boundary
pass per the architect's spec, not Stage 3.

For Stage 3 I therefore kept the result-type narrowing OUT, and the
fast-path benefit shows up at the per-op level: every single bitwise
op with i32 operands skips its own ToInt32 dance. Chains don't
*compose* — each `&`/`|`/etc. converts back to f64 then forward to i32
for the next op — but `wasm-opt` already collapses such redundant
round-trips, and the cost-dominant cases (`bool|bool`, compare-result
reductions) are covered.

### What's gated by the Stage 2 i32-domain flag

Nothing in this PR is gated by `JS2WASM_IR_I32_DOMAIN`. The lowerer
fast path fires whenever operand IrTypes are i32 — that includes the
existing producers (boolean values, comparison results). My from-ast
relaxation of `requireF64` for bitwise/shift accepts i32 operands
unconditionally too. Flipping the Stage 2 flag (a separate PR — see
`propagate.ts:i32DomainEnabled()`) lets the lattice atoms `i32`/`u32`
appear in the `TypeMap`, which feeds new functions through the
selector. That separate flip and any Stage 4 boundary work can build
on this PR's foundation.

### Test coverage

`tests/issue-1126-stage3.test.ts`:
- 8 dual-run equivalence tests (legacy vs IR) for compare-result
  bitwise reductions (`|`, `&`, `^`, `<<`) and chained bitwise.
- 2 magnitude-compare equivalence tests using bool-coerced operands.
- 2 #1236 sentinel tests asserting `2^30 + 2^30 = 2^31` and
  `2^16 * 2^16 = 2^32` — arithmetic on i32-domain values must NOT
  emit `i32.add`/`i32.mul` (which would wrap).
- 5 code-shape tests asserting `i32.or` / `i32.and` / `i32.shl` /
  `i32.lt_s` appear in the WAT body, and the `f64.trunc ... 
  i32.trunc_sat_f64_u` ToInt32 sequence does NOT appear when the
  fast path fires.

All 15 tests pass. Existing IR test suite (`ir-numeric-bool-equivalence`,
`ir-frontend-widening`, `ir-let-const-equivalence`,
`ir-if-else-equivalence`, `ir-ternary-equivalence`, `ir-propagate-i32`,
`ir-propagate-i32-rules`, `linear-bitwise`, `issue-1236`) all pass —
no regressions.

### Files touched

- `src/ir/lower.ts` — fast-path peek at operand types; rhs-i32 scratch
  slot variant; `tryTypeOf` and `jsBitwiseToI32` helpers.
- `src/ir/nodes.ts` — eight new `IrBinop` variants for native i32
  magnitude compares.
- `src/ir/from-ast.ts` — relax `requireF64` for bitwise/shift to
  accept i32 operands; pick native `i32.{lt,le,gt,ge}_{s,u}` for i32
  compares based on operand signedness.
- `src/ir/passes/constant-fold.ts` — folders for the new compare
  variants.
- `tests/issue-1126-stage3.test.ts` — new test file.
