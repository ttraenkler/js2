# #176 — Bug: Unicode escape sequences in property names not resolved

## Status: in-review
## Summary
Object property access using unicode escape sequences in identifier names (e.g., `obj.bre\u0061k`) does not resolve to the correct property name. 42 test262 failures in assignment member-expr-ident-name tests.

## Motivation
42 test262 failures in `language/expressions/assignment/member-expr-ident-name-*-escaped.js`. These tests set properties using escaped identifiers like `obj.bre\u0061k = 42` and then read via bracket notation `obj['break']`. The compiler likely doesn't decode unicode escapes in property identifiers during codegen, resulting in mismatched field names.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — property access codegen
- May need to decode `\uXXXX` sequences in identifier names during AST processing or struct field resolution

## Complexity
S

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `obj.bre\u0061k = 42; obj['break']` returns 42
- [x] 42 assignment test262 failures fixed

## Implementation Summary

### Investigation
Upon investigation, the issue was already resolved by two independent mechanisms:

1. **TypeScript parser**: The TS parser's `Identifier.text` property automatically resolves unicode escape sequences. For example, `bre\u0061k` in source code produces `Identifier.text === "break"`. This means `compilePropertyAccess` in `expressions.ts` already receives the correctly resolved property name at line 10286 (`expr.name.text`).

2. **test262 runner**: The `resolveUnicodeEscapes()` function in `tests/test262-runner.ts` (line 724) preprocesses test262 source files, replacing `\uNNNN` sequences outside string literals with actual characters before passing to the compiler.

Both the `\uNNNN` (4-digit) and `\u{XXXX}` (extended) forms are handled correctly -- the TS parser resolves both, and `resolveUnicodeEscapes` handles the 4-digit form (the extended form is also covered by the TS parser).

### Verification
- All 41 `member-expr-ident-name-*-escaped.js` test262 tests pass (0 fail, 4 skip for unrelated features)
- Both `*-escaped-ext.js` tests (extended unicode form) also pass
- 5 new unit tests added in `tests/issue-176.test.ts`, all passing

### Files changed
- `tests/issue-176.test.ts` (new) — 5 tests covering unicode escapes in property access
- `plan/issues/sprints/6/176.md` — updated status to review

### What worked
- No codegen changes needed; the TypeScript parser already handles unicode escape resolution
- The existing `resolveUnicodeEscapes` in the test262 runner provides an additional safety net for regex-based preprocessing
