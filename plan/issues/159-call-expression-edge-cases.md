# #159 — Call expression edge cases

## Problem
Several call expression patterns were unsupported:
1. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions): `(function() { ... })()`
2. Extra arguments beyond declared parameter count: `f(a, b)` where `f` takes 0 params
3. Mutable captures in IIFEs: outer variables modified inside the IIFE

## Implementation

### IIFE support
Added `compileIIFE()` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` that:
- Detects when a CallExpression's callee is a (possibly parenthesized) FunctionExpression or ArrowFunction
- Compiles the function body as a lifted module-level function with a unique synthetic name
- Handles captures from the enclosing scope, using ref cells for mutable captures
- Emits a direct call with captured values as leading arguments

### Extra arguments
Modified the normal call path to compare argument count against the function's parameter count.
Arguments beyond the parameter count are compiled for side effects (JS evaluation order semantics)
and their results are dropped.

### Test harness
- Added `__make_callback` stub to equivalence test imports (needed when function expressions exist)
- Added 5 new equivalence tests covering IIFE and extra argument patterns

## Status: done

## Tests
- 77/77 equivalence tests pass (5 new)
- No test262 call tests newly pass (remaining 14 compile errors all have deeper blockers: `arguments` object, string types, undeclared variables)

## Complexity: S
