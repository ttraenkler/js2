# #193 — Coalesce operator wasm type mismatch

## Status: in-review
## Summary
7 coalesce (`??`) operator tests fail to compile. While 11 pass, the remaining errors involve wasm type mismatches when the left/right operands have different types.

## Motivation
7 test262 compile errors in `language/expressions/coalesce`:
- 1 wasm validation error: "type error in fallthru[0] (expected i32, got f64)"
- 6 TS compile errors (type not assignable, unsupported call expression)

The nullish coalescing operator needs to handle mixed-type operands (e.g., `null ?? 42` where null is ref type and 42 is f64).

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — coalesce operator type handling

## Complexity
S

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `null ?? 42` compiles and returns 42
- [ ] Mixed-type coalesce operands produce correct wasm
- [ ] 3+ test262 coalesce errors fixed

## Implementation notes
- Rewrote `compileNullishCoalescing` to discover RHS type naturally (without forced hint)
- When LHS and RHS types differ, uses RHS type as unified type since null case always returns RHS
- Coerces LHS (else branch) to RHS type when types differ
- Note: `number | null` maps to f64 in wasm, so null is indistinguishable from 0 at that level
