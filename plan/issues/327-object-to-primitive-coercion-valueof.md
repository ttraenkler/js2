# #327 -- Object-to-primitive coercion (valueOf/toString)

## Status: in-review
17 test262 tests fail with "Cannot convert object to primitive value". Operations like increment/decrement and arithmetic on objects require calling valueOf() or toString() per the ToPrimitive spec.

## Error pattern
- TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value

## Likely causes
- Prefix/postfix increment/decrement on object values needs ToPrimitive
- Destructuring rest assignment tries to convert object
- Missing valueOf/toString dispatch in arithmetic contexts

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Reduce test262 failures matching this error pattern

## Implementation Summary

### Root causes found and fixed

1. **Module-level prefix/postfix increment/decrement statements were silently dropped.**
   The `collectDeclarations` function in `index.ts` only collected `BinaryExpression`
   assignment statements (`=`) for module init. `PrefixUnaryExpression` (`++x`) and
   `PostfixUnaryExpression` (`x++`) were not collected, so they never executed.

2. **Externref globals assumed f64 arithmetic in increment/decrement.**
   Module globals and captured globals with `externref` type (used for `any`-typed
   variables) were treated as f64. The code emitted `global.get` (externref) +
   `f64.const 1` + `f64.add`, which is a Wasm type error. Now properly unboxes
   to f64, does arithmetic, and boxes back.

3. **`__unbox_number` crashes on WasmGC struct externrefs.**
   When a WasmGC struct is stored as externref (via `extern.convert_any`), calling
   the JS host `Number(v)` throws "Cannot convert object to primitive value". Added
   `emitSafeExternrefToF64()` that uses `__typeof_number` to detect JS numbers vs
   GC objects before calling `__unbox_number`, returning NaN for non-numbers.

4. **ref/ref_null locals in increment/decrement now use coerceType.**
   Instead of hardcoding NaN, the code now calls `coerceType(ref -> f64)` which
   dispatches through valueOf/toString if available on the struct type.

5. **Widened module init statement collection** to include compound assignment
   operators (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) in addition to simple `=`.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- Fix all prefix/postfix inc/dec paths for externref/ref globals and locals
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- Collect ++/-- and compound assignment statements for module init
- `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` -- Add `emitSafeExternrefToF64()` helper
- `tests/equivalence/object-to-primitive.test.ts` -- 6 new equivalence tests
