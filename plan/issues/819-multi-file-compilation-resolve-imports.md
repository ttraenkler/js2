# #819 -- Multi-file compilation: resolve imports and compile module graphs

## Problem

The compiler only accepts a single source string. Any `import { foo } from "./a.ts"` is unresolved — the imported symbols are undefined at codegen time. This makes the compiler unusable for real multi-file projects and blocks 783 test262 tests that import `_FIXTURE.js` helpers.

Bundling first (esbuild/rollup) is not a workaround because bundlers strip TypeScript type annotations, which the compiler needs to decide Wasm types.

## Approach

Use TypeScript's `createProgram` with multiple source files instead of single-file compilation:

1. **Entry point mode**: `compile(entryPath)` instead of `compile(sourceString)`
   - Keep the single-string API for backwards compat / test262
2. **Module resolution**: Let TypeScript resolve imports via its standard module resolution
   - `createProgram([entryFile], compilerOptions)` automatically pulls in imported files
   - The checker already resolves cross-file types, symbols, and declarations
3. **Multi-file codegen**: Iterate all source files in the program
   - Collect classes, functions, globals from ALL files (not just one)
   - Emit into a single Wasm module (same as today, just with more input)
4. **Export only entry file's exports**: Only the entry file's `export` declarations become Wasm exports

## What changes

- `src/codegen/index.ts`: `compileProgram()` accepts a `ts.Program` with multiple source files
- Collection phase: iterate `program.getSourceFiles()` (excluding lib/node_modules)
- Codegen phase: compile statements from all user source files in dependency order
- CLI: accept a file path, resolve imports automatically
- Keep `compile(source: string)` as a convenience wrapper (creates a single-file program)

## Test plan

- Equivalence test: two-file import (a.ts exports function, b.ts imports and calls it)
- test262: inline _FIXTURE.js files or resolve them as second source files → unblocks 783 tests
- CLI: `ts2wasm src/main.ts` compiles main.ts + all its imports

## Impact

- Unlocks real-world multi-file projects
- Unblocks 783 test262 tests (FIXTURE imports)
- Foundation for library/package support

## Implementation Notes

The multi-file compilation infrastructure (`compileMulti`, `analyzeMultiSource`, `generateMultiModule`)
already existed. This issue added:

1. **`compileFiles(entryPath, options?)`** -- new public API in `src/index.ts` that reads from disk
   using `ts.createProgram` with real filesystem access. TypeScript resolves all imports automatically
   via standard Node module resolution.

2. **`analyzeFiles(entryPath)`** -- new function in `src/checker/index.ts` that creates a real
   filesystem-backed `ts.Program`, collects user source files (skipping lib/node_modules/declaration
   files), and returns a `MultiTypedAST`.

3. **Bug fix**: Fixed `KNOWN_LIB_NAMES is not defined` error in `analyzeMultiSource` -- the virtual
   file host's `fileExists` was referencing an undefined `KNOWN_LIB_NAMES` instead of calling
   `isKnownLibName()`. This broke all in-memory multi-file compilation.

4. **Equivalence tests**: `tests/equivalence/multi-file-compilation.test.ts` with 5 tests covering
   two-file imports, three-file chains, export scoping, and disk-based compilation.
