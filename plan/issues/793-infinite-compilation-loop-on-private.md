# #793 -- Infinite compilation loop on private-methods class expressions (5 tests)

## Problem

All 5 tests in `test/language/expressions/class/elements/private-methods/` cause the compiler to hang (100% CPU, infinite loop). Added to HANGING_TESTS skip list as a workaround.

Hanging tests:
- `prod-private-method.js`
- `prod-private-async-generator.js`
- `prod-private-async-method.js`
- `prod-private-generator.js`
- `prod-private-method-initialize-order.js`

## Common pattern

All tests use:
- Class expressions with `#m` private methods (`class { #m() { ... } }`)
- `new C()` constructor invocation
- `Reflect.has` and `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`
- Private method access via `this.#m`

The trigger is likely `new C()` on a class with private methods — the compiler enters an infinite loop during class constructor or private method dispatch compilation.

## Root cause (suspected)

Likely introduced by #792 (multi-struct dispatch) or #413 (param TDZ). The new `emitGuardedRefCast` backup/retry logic or `buildVecFromExternref` loop construction may recurse infinitely when compiling private method access patterns.

## Reproduction

```bash
timeout 10 npx tsx src/cli.ts test262/test/language/expressions/class/elements/private-methods/prod-private-method.js
```

## Fix approach

1. Bisect: revert #792 and #413 individually to identify which introduced the hang
2. Add a recursion depth guard or visited-set to the suspected loop
3. Remove from HANGING_TESTS once fixed

## Files

- `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` — buildVecFromExternref, emitGuardedRefCast
- `src/codegen/property-access.ts` — emitNullGuardedStructGet backup logic
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — class compilation

## Implementation notes (2026-03-27)

The infinite compilation loop was already fixed by prior commits (likely the ref.cast
regression fix in #815 or the illegal cast guard fixes). All 16 previously-hanging
private class element tests now compile successfully within normal time.

Changes made:
1. Removed all 16 private class element tests from HANGING_TESTS (14 #793 + 2 #701)
2. Removed the broad `class/elements/` skip filter in `shouldSkip()` that was blocking
   ~3,073 tests from running
3. The remaining HANGING_TESTS entries (Promise.race #408, Map forEach, Temporal) are
   unrelated to private class elements and kept as-is

This unblocks approximately 3,000+ class/elements tests that were previously skipped
as a workaround for the 16 hanging tests.
