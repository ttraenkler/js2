# #887 -- Project roadmap for STF application

## Problem

The Sovereign Technology Fund needs to see a clear roadmap: what has been achieved, what's planned, and why this matters for digital sovereignty.

## Requirements

Create `ROADMAP.md` with:

### 1. Vision statement
- Compile full JavaScript/TypeScript to WebAssembly AOT — no interpreter, no runtime, smallest possible output
- Enable true platform-independent deployment: same .wasm runs on any host (browser, WASI, edge, embedded)
- No vendor lock-in: standalone mode requires zero host APIs

### 2. Achieved (sprints 1-31)
- 768+ issues closed
- 35.9% test262 conformance (17,252 / 48,088 tests)
- Features: generators, async/await, TypedArray, destructuring, classes, modules, tail calls, SIMD
- Dual mode: JS host (fast) + standalone WASI (portable)
- WIT generator for Component Model interop
- Comprehensive test infrastructure (48K automated tests, CI-ready)

### 3. Near-term (sprints 32-40)
- Target: 60% conformance
- Property descriptors, prototype chain, iterator protocol
- Dashboard and observability tooling
- CI/CD with automated conformance gating

### 4. Medium-term (6 months)
- Target: 80% conformance
- Full ES2024 compliance for common patterns
- Performance benchmarks vs V8/QuickJS
- NPM package for easy integration
- Documentation and tutorials

### 5. Long-term (12 months)
- Target: 90%+ conformance
- Production-ready for real applications
- Component Model + WASI P2 support
- Package ecosystem (compile npm packages to Wasm)

### 6. Sovereign technology relevance
- No dependency on Google V8, Apple JSC, or Mozilla SpiderMonkey
- Runs anywhere WebAssembly runs — true portability
- Deterministic compilation — same input → same output
- Module isolation by default (each function is a self-contained Wasm module)
- Open source, reproducible, auditable

## Acceptance criteria

- ROADMAP.md in repo root
- Linked from README
- Covers vision, achieved, planned, sovereign tech relevance
