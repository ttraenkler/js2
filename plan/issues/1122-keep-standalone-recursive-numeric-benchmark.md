# #1122 -- Keep standalone recursive numeric benchmark stable across non-run entry exports

## Problem

The competitive recursive Fibonacci benchmark regressed again when the exported
entrypoint was changed from `run` to `main`.

Benchmark file:

- `benchmarks/competitive/programs/fib-recursive.js`

Observed behavior with both numeric JSDoc hints restored:

1. `js2wasm -> Node.js (hosted)` compiles and runs again
2. `js2wasm -> Wasmtime` no longer stays on the previous good standalone path
3. the standalone lane now fails with:
   - `compile-error: [parse exception: popping from empty stack (at 0:3667)]`

This means the current standalone path is still sensitive to exported entrypoint
shape, even when the recursive numeric kernel itself is typed and otherwise
known-good.

## Why it matters

- benchmark credibility should not depend on the entry export being named `run`
- the harness should be able to benchmark a realistic `main`-style entrypoint
  without destabilizing standalone codegen
- this blocks using a source shape that avoids additional wrapper assumptions in
  the benchmark itself

## Goal

Make the standalone recursive numeric benchmark compile and run correctly for
typed entrypoints even when the exported function is not named `run`.

## Requirements

1. Preserve the previous small standalone recursive `fib` code path when the
   benchmark export is `main`
2. Eliminate the standalone parse exception introduced by the `main` entrypoint
   shape
3. Keep hosted and standalone behavior aligned for the same typed recursive
   kernel
4. Avoid reintroducing boxed-number imports or fallback generic value paths

## Acceptance criteria

- `benchmarks/competitive/programs/fib-recursive.js` works with `main` as the
  exported benchmark entrypoint
- `js2wasm -> Node.js` and `js2wasm -> Wasmtime` both succeed for the typed
  recursive benchmark
- the standalone module stays in the previous small-size range instead of
  regressing to the larger fallback shape
- benchmark timings stay close to the previous typed fast-path result

## Notes

- This is separate from `#1121`, which tracks removing the JSDoc hints entirely
- This issue is specifically about preserving the known-good standalone path
  across entrypoint shape changes
