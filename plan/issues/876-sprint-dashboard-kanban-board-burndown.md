# #876 -- Sprint dashboard — kanban board, burndown chart, agent status, metrics

## Problem

Sprint progress is only visible by asking the tech lead or reading scattered files (sprint docs, task lists, diary). Need a visual dashboard that shows sprint state at a glance.

## Requirements

Build a web dashboard (HTML/JS, served locally or as static file) that displays:

### 1. Kanban board
- Columns: Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Review → Done
- Cards show issue number, title, assigned dev, priority
- Data source: `plan/issues/` directory structure + issue frontmatter

### 2. Burndown chart
- X-axis: time (sprint duration)
- Y-axis: remaining tasks/issues
- Data source: `plan/issues/sprints/{N}/sprint.md` task table + `git log` timestamps

### 3. Active agents
- Show currently running agents with name, role, current task, uptime
- Data source: `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json` + task list

### 4. Sprint metrics
- Test262 pass rate trend (from `benchmarks/results/runs/index.json`)
- Issues closed this sprint
- CE fixed / FAIL fixed
- Velocity: issues per sprint (from `plan/sprints/` history)
- Stale issues caught by smoke-test

### 5. Process health
- Checklist compliance (commits with CHECKLIST-FOXTROT)
- Merge protocol: ff-only vs merge-commit count
- Rebase churn: how many re-merges per task
- Hook blocks: how many dangerous operations caught

## Implementation

- Static HTML + vanilla JS (no build step, no dependencies)
- Reads data from local files via fetch or embedded JSON
- Put in `dashboard/index.html`
- Can be opened directly in browser or served via `npx serve dashboard/`

## Acceptance criteria

- Dashboard opens in browser showing current sprint state
- Kanban board reflects actual issue status
- Burndown chart shows trend
- Test262 pass rate trend from runs/index.json
- Refreshable — re-reads data on reload

## Implementation Summary

Built static HTML + vanilla JS dashboard at `dashboard/index.html`:

- **Kanban board** — 4 columns (blocked/ready/in-progress/done) with cards showing issue ID, title, priority, feasibility
- **Test262 pass rate trend chart** — canvas-drawn line chart from `benchmarks/results/runs/index.json`
- **Test262 breakdown chart** — pass/fail/CE trend lines
- **Sprint history table** — parsed from `plan/issues/*/sprint.md`
- **Velocity bar chart** — issues merged per sprint
- **Metric cards** — pass rate, done count, ready count, blocked count, CE, FAIL
- **Process health** — total done, total runs, pass delta, ready ratio

Data pipeline:
- `dashboard/build-data.js` — reads project files, generates `dashboard/data/` JSON + `dashboard/data.js` (embedded mode)
- Dashboard works in two modes: HTTP serve (fetch from `data/`) or file:// (uses embedded `data.js`)
- No npm dependencies, no build step
