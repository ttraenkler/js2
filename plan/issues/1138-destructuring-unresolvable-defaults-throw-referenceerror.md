## Problem

When destructuring with a default value that references an unresolvable identifier (e.g. `const { x = missingVar } = obj`), the compiler produced `undefined` instead of throwing a `ReferenceError` as required by the spec. This caused 115 test262 failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Unresolvable default initializers throw `ReferenceError` at runtime
- [x] +115 test262 tests pass

## Implementation

Merged via PR #216 (branch `issue-dstr-default-unresolvable`).
