# #390 -- Assignment to non-array types (70 CE)

## Status: open

70 tests fail because the compiler rejects element access assignment (`obj[key] = value`) when the target is not an array type. This includes object types, class instances, and externref values.

## Details

The compiler currently only supports `arr[index] = value` for Wasm array types. JavaScript allows bracket assignment on any object:

```javascript
var obj = {};
obj["key"] = "value";
obj[0] = "first";
```

Fix:
1. For struct-typed objects with known fields, resolve to `struct.set`
2. For externref objects, route through `__extern_set` host import
3. For objects with index signatures, handle numeric and string index assignment

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `obj["key"] = value` works for struct-backed objects
- [ ] `obj[index] = value` works for externref objects
- [ ] Reduce test262 compile errors by ~70
