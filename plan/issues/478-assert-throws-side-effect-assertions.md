# #478 — assert.throws side-effect assertions (342 tests)

342 tests are skipped because they use `assert.throws` with side-effect-dependent assertions that our current shim doesn't handle. The #397 shim calls the function and catches errors but doesn't verify the error type or check side effects after the throw. Narrow the skip filter or enhance the shim.
