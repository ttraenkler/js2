# Issue #601: Binaryen wasm-opt post-processing pass

## Problem

ts2wasm does not run Binaryen's optimizer on compiled output, leaving 15-30% code size
and 10-20% runtime performance on the table.

## Solution

Add an `optimize` option to `CompileOptions` and `--optimize` / `-O` CLI flag that runs
the compiled Wasm binary through Binaryen's wasm-opt optimizer as a post-processing step.

Two strategies are tried in order:
1. The `binaryen` npm package (dynamic require, no hard dependency)
2. A system `wasm-opt` binary on PATH

If neither is available, the original binary is returned unchanged with a warning.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Created `src/optimize.ts` with `optimizeBinary()` function
- Added `optimize` option to `CompileOptions` in `src/index.ts`
- Integrated optimization step into both `compileSource` and `compileMultiSource` in `src/compiler.ts`
- Added `--optimize` / `-O` / `-O1` through `-O4` CLI flags in `src/cli.ts`
- Created `tests/wasm-opt-optimize.test.ts` with 6 tests covering:
  - Compilation without optimize flag
  - Compilation with optimize: true
  - Compilation with optimize: 1
  - Graceful fallback when wasm-opt is unavailable
  - Valid wasm header verification
  - WAT output independence from optimization

### Files changed
- `src/optimize.ts` (new) - Binaryen optimization module
- `src/compiler.ts` - Import and integration of optimization step
- `src/index.ts` - Added `optimize` option to `CompileOptions`
- `src/cli.ts` - Added CLI flags
- `tests/wasm-opt-optimize.test.ts` (new) - Integration tests
