# #3245 — async-gen dstr host-free-FAIL cluster decomposition

Tracking issue for the async-generator dstr host-free-FAIL cluster (files that
compile host-free under `--target standalone` but fail at runtime). Filed so the
non-#3244 roots and the two measurement artifacts are not lost.

## Root decomposition (verified against origin/main @ 503b64ac35, 2026-07-13)

An in-process batch scan of all 558 async-generator dstr files reported ~85
host-free fails; classified by TRUE root (each verified by instrumenting the
actual wrapped source + cold isolated repros — the per-assert line labels are
unreliable, see Artifact A):

| Root                                               | ~files | Owner / disposition                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **any-boxed reference-element read** (#3244)       | bulk   | **#3244** (dominant gate)                           |
| **any-strict-eq object identity** (`notSameValue`) | ~30    | opus-genproto3 (ref.eq object `===`, extends #2734) |
| error-path throws (ReferenceError / TypeError)     | ~29    | **MIRAGE — see below**                              |
| `__array_from_iter_n` over-pull / IteratorClose    | small  | this issue (genuine, isolation-resistant)           |
| object-rest `{...rest}` exclusion                  | ~9     | this issue (verify vs #3244)                        |

## The error-path "root #2" is a MIRAGE (29 files)

The error-raising MECHANISMS work — do NOT build an "error-machinery" slice
from this bucket:

- **Unresolvable-default → ReferenceError**: `[ x = unresolvableReference ] = []`
  / `{ x: y = unresolvableReference }` — the PURE error-path test files
  (`obj-ptrn-prop-id-init-unresolvable`, `dflt-ary-ptrn-elem-id-init-unresolvable`,
  `ary-ptrn-elem-id-init-unresolvable`, expr variants) **PASS cold on both
  lanes**. Isolated probe of unbound-name read + `typeof` unbound + renamed-bind
  read-original all raise ReferenceError correctly (`.tmp/referr.mts`).
- **Poisoned-iterator/getter → TypeError**: `dflt-ary-init-iter-get-err`,
  `ary-init-iter-get-err`, `ary-ptrn-elem-id-iter-step-err`,
  `obj-ptrn-prop-eval-err` — **PASS cold**.

Files bucketed here (because their SOURCE contains an `assert.throws(...)` probe)
actually fail on a preceding **binding-value** assert rooted in **#3244**. E.g.
`obj-ptrn-prop-obj-init.js` (`async function* f({ w: { x, y, z } = {x:4,y:5,z:6} })`,
called `f({ w: undefined })`) — instrumented cold, `x` reads back WRONG (not 4):
the nested-object default binds through an any-boxed param → #3244. The
ReferenceError probe in the same file never gets to matter. **⇒ Root #2 collapses
into #3244; no independent error-machinery bug here.**

## Genuine, non-#3244 residuals (this issue owns)

1. **`__array_from_iter_n` over-pull for a param pattern over a custom
   iterator** — `async function* f([x]) {}` called with a never-`done` custom
   iterator (`ary-init-iter-close.js`) traps "requested new array is too large
   in `__array_from_iter_n`" instead of pulling 1 + IteratorClose (`return()`).
   NOTE: the simplified local `const [x,y] = iter` and a plain-param `f([x])`
   over an _incrementing_ infinite iterator both work cold — this repro is
   **isolation-resistant** (only the async-gen frame + the specific
   `{value:null,done:false}` iterator triggers it). Needs in-frame diagnosis.
2. **object-rest `{a, b, ...rest}`** — `assert.sameValue(rest.a, undefined)`
   fails (`obj-ptrn-rest-val-obj.js`, `dflt-obj-ptrn-rest-val-obj.js`). Verify
   whether genuine rest-exclusion or #3244-adjacent (rest object built over an
   any-boxed source).

## Artifact A — unreliable per-assert line labels

The runner maps a failing `test()` return value (the assert counter) back to a
source line by text search. Async microtask reordering shifts the
assert-count→line mapping, so labels like "assert #6 notSameValue" routinely
mislabel the true failing assert. **Always instrument the actual wrapped source
(bitmask per assert) — never trust the label.** (This is how the 30 `notSameValue`
files were shown to fail on any-eq, not rest-binding.)

## Artifact B — in-process runner warm/cold order-dependence

The same file, same target, gives different pass/fail depending on run ORDER in
one process: `obj-ptrn-prop-obj-init.js` **PASSES** when run after other async
files, **FAILS** cold (first / fresh process, deterministic across 3 runs).
Running other async tests first "warms up" state that spuriously flips a
genuinely-failing file to pass ⇒ **batch in-process scans UNDER-count fails**.
Cold isolated per-file runs are authoritative. Root not yet identified (compiler
program/checker cache affecting later-file codegen? shared microtask/scheduler
state on the host side?). Worth a runner-hygiene fix so async floor measurements
are order-independent.

## Disposition

The async-gen dstr host-free-fail floor gain is **gated on #3244** (dominant) +
genproto3 (any-eq). The residuals above are minor levers. Recommend landing
#3244 first, then re-measuring the cluster cold before touching residuals.

## Repros

`/workspace/.claude/worktrees/*/.tmp/`: `referr.mts`, `cold.mts`,
`statebleed.mts`, `bitmask3.mts`, `iterpull.mts`, `parampull.mts`,
`classify.mts`.

## Post-#3244 cold re-measure (2026-07-17, fable-s2) — CLOSING

#3244 is `done` on main. Cold isolated per-file re-runs (one process per
file, `--target standalone`) of every residual this issue owned:

| File                                                                   | Pre (#3245 filing) | Now                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `ary-init-iter-close.js` (residual 1: `__array_from_iter_n` over-pull) | trap               | **pass**                             |
| `obj-ptrn-rest-val-obj.js` (residual 2: rest exclusion)                | fail               | **pass**                             |
| `obj-ptrn-prop-obj-init.js` (#3244-rooted control)                     | fail cold          | **pass**                             |
| `dflt-obj-ptrn-rest-val-obj.js`                                        | fail               | **still fails** (`rest.a` assert #1) |

Both owned residuals collapsed with #3244's landing except the `dflt-`
variant — and reduction shows that one is NOT a rest bug at all: the
whole-pattern param **default OBJECT LITERAL never binds on standalone**
(`function f({a,b}: any = {a:5,b:3}); f()` — even `a === 5` is false; the
module-var default, host lane, and passed-arg variants all work). Filed as
**#3333** with the full differential and a 6-line repro; that issue now owns
the `dflt-*` dstr template family on the standalone lane.

Artifact B (warm/cold order-dependence of the in-process runner) is at least
partially addressed by #3318 (PR #3181): `restoreHostBuiltins()` at
`runTest262File` entry removes cross-test REALM pollution, one confirmed
order-dependence mechanism (it manufactured phantom compile_errors). If a
non-pollution warm/cold flip is still observed after #3318 lands, measure it
fresh — do not reopen this tracker.

Disposition: analysis complete; all roots either landed (#3244), collapsed
(error-path mirage), or precisely re-filed (#3333). Closing.
