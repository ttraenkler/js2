# #656 — Null pointer dereferences (2,050 FAIL)

## Status: open

2,050 tests fail with null pointer deref. Up from 1,513 (more tests attempted). #647 fixed destructuring params but many more codepaths access struct fields on potentially-null references.

### Top patterns
- Property access on optional/undefined params
- Method calls on possibly-null class instances
- Iterator results that could be null

## Complexity: M
