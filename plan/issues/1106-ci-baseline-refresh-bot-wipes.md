# #1106 — CI baseline-refresh bot wipes plan/ and .claude/memory/ on every run

## Problem

The baseline-refresh bot commits from a stale runner checkout. When tech-lead
commits plan files during the same window, the bot's commit stages deletions of
those files (absent from the runner checkout), wiping them.

Observed: commit `c3452b53` deleted 12 issue files, sprint-42.md, 2 memory
files, pnpm-lock.yaml. Required manual restore (`55a9e41e`).

## Root cause

`.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml` line ~284, rebase-conflict path:

```bash
git reset --soft origin/main
```

`--soft` resets HEAD to origin/main but **leaves the staged index intact**.
The index at that point contains the inverse of every commit that landed on
main since the runner started. So when `901789cb` (import cleanup, 67 src/
files) landed mid-run, the `--soft` reset staged the full reversion of those
files. The subsequent `git add -f benchmarks/results/ ...` added benchmark
files on top — but the src/ reversions remained staged and went into the commit.

## Fix

One-word change in `.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml` line ~284:

```diff
-            git reset --soft origin/main
+            git reset --mixed origin/main
```

`--mixed` resets both HEAD and the index to origin/main, clearing all staged
changes. The `cp` + `git add -f benchmarks/results/` lines that follow then
stage only the fresh benchmark files — nothing else.

No other changes needed. The `git add` paths are already explicit and correct.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Promote job uses explicit `git add <paths>` for benchmark/ci-status files only
- [ ] Promote job runs `git pull --rebase origin main` before committing
- [ ] Concurrent tech-lead commits during CI do NOT cause plan/ deletions
