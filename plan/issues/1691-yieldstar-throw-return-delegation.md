# #1691 — yield* does not delegate throw()/return() to the inner iterator

## Problem

`yield* <iterable>` correctly forwards `next()` values but does **not** forward
the outer generator's `throw()` / `return()` into the delegated iterator, as
required by ECMAScript §14.4.14 (YieldExpression : `yield * AssignmentExpression`,
the `received.[[Type]] is throw` / `is return` branches).

13 test262 cases in `language/expressions/yield` fail on this — the entire
`star-rhs-iter-thrw-*` family plus `star-rhs-iter-thrw-violation-*`:

- `star-rhs-iter-thrw-thrw-invoke.js` — asserts the delegate's `throw` method
  is invoked with the thrown value; compiler returns wrong sentinel (observed 7777).
- `star-rhs-iter-thrw-res-value-final.js` — observed 2222 instead of delegated value.
- `star-rhs-iter-thrw-res-done-err.js`, `-res-done-no-value.js`,
  `-res-value-err.js`, `-thrw-call-err.js`, `-thrw-call-non-obj.js`,
  `-thrw-get-err.js`, `-violation-no-rtrn.js`, `-violation-rtrn-call-err.js`,
  `-violation-rtrn-call-non-obj.js`, `-violation-rtrn-get-err.js`,
  `-violation-rtrn-invoke.js`.

The sibling `return()` delegation (`star-rhs-iter-rtrn-*`) compiles but does not
exercise true lazy delegation either; it currently passes only because the eager
model happens to drain to completion for the simple shapes.

## Root cause

The compiler uses an **eager generator model**. `compileYieldExpression`
(`src/codegen/expressions/misc.ts:177`, the `expr.asteriskToken` branch) lowers
`yield* x` to a call to `__gen_yield_star(buffer, iterable)`.

`__gen_yield_star` (`src/runtime.ts:5692`) is:

```js
(buf, iterable) => {
  if (iterable != null && typeof iterable[Symbol.iterator] === "function") {
    for (const v of iterable) { buf.push(v); }   // next() only
  }
};
```

It drains the inner iterator via a plain `for...of` (calling **only** `next()`)
and pushes every value into the outer generator's buffer eagerly. By the time
user code calls `outerGen.throw(e)` or `outerGen.return(v)`, the inner iterator
has already been fully consumed and discarded — there is no live delegate to
forward the completion to. So the §14.4.14 step-5.b (`throw`) and step-5.c
(`return`) branches are unobservable.

## Why this is hard (feasibility: hard)

Correct `yield*` throw/return delegation requires the generator to **suspend**
at the `yield*` point holding a reference to the live inner iterator, so a later
`throw()`/`return()` on the outer generator can be routed to the delegate's
corresponding method. That is exactly the lazy / re-entrant generator semantics
the eager-buffer model was designed to avoid.

This should be folded into the lazy-generator / CPS work, not patched in the
eager runtime:
- #1665 (native generators — shared `$Iterator` design gap)
- #1373 / #1042 (IR async + CPS lowering — the suspend/resume machinery)

A localized patch to `__gen_yield_star` cannot satisfy the protocol because the
suspension point does not exist in the eager model.

## Acceptance criteria

- `yield*` suspends at the delegation point and forwards `throw()`/`return()` to
  the inner iterator per §14.4.14 steps 5.b / 5.c.
- The 13 `star-rhs-iter-thrw-*` test262 cases pass.
- `star-rhs-iter-rtrn-*` continue to pass under the lazy model.

## Investigation notes (2026-05-27)

Probe of all 63 `language/expressions/yield` tests (proper host imports via
`buildImports` + `wrapTest`): 45 PASS + 3 PASS(negative-CE) = 48 passing; 13
fail on the throw-delegation gap above; 2 are TS-strictness CE artifacts in the
test source (`star-return-is-null.js`, `star-rhs-iter-rtrn-rtrn-invoke.js` —
`'this' implicitly has type 'any'` / iterator-shape typing, not genuine JS parse
failures — out of scope for this issue).

## Re-investigation 2026-05-28 (senior-developer)

Re-walked the eager-buffer model to confirm whether anything has shifted that
would unlock a localized fix. Conclusion: **architectural block confirmed,
no hybrid path is feasible without the lazy/CPS generator lowering.**

### Code-path walk (current main)

1. `compileYieldExpression` (`src/codegen/expressions/misc.ts:177`) emits
   `__gen_yield_star(buf, iterable)` synchronously inside the generator body.
2. `__gen_yield_star` (`src/runtime.ts:6544`) is a single closure:
   `for (const v of iterable) buf.push(v)`. It runs to completion at the
   `yield*` call site. Only `iterable[Symbol.iterator]().next()` is touched —
   `throw`/`return` are never even *looked up*, let alone retained.
3. By the time `__create_generator` (`src/runtime.ts:6556`) wraps `buf` and
   returns the generator object, the inner iterator has been fully consumed
   and dropped. There is no reference to it on the state record
   (`_GeneratorState` at `src/runtime.ts:71` stores only `{buf, index,
   pendingThrow}`).
4. `Generator.prototype.throw` (`src/runtime.ts:216`) does
   `state.index = state.buf.length; throw e` — there is no delegate slot to
   route into, because the suspension point does not exist.

### Why a "remember the delegate" patch doesn't work

To forward `outer.throw(e)` per §14.4.14 step 5.b.ii, the outer generator
body must pause **mid-iteration** at the `yield*` site holding a live
reference to the inner iterator. Adding a `delegate` slot to the state
record is not enough: the generator body would still have to *resume after
the throw was forwarded*, drain remaining inner values into the outer
buffer (or propagate IteratorClose), and continue with the next outer
statement. That resume-after-yield* requires a continuation / state
machine for the outer body — which is exactly what the eager model
deliberately omitted. Once `g()` returns, the outer body is gone; there is
no way to "go back" to it.

A partial workaround (`__gen_yield_star` calls `.throw` on the inner
iterator *during the eager drain* if some future `pendingThrow` flag is
set) would require either reading the future state (impossible — the
drain happens before `g()` returns the generator) or making `next()`
itself the driver of the inner drain, one step at a time — which **is**
the lazy generator model (#1665).

### Concrete failure mode

```ts
function* inner() { yield 11; yield 22; yield 33; }
function* outer() { yield* inner(); }
const it = outer();
it.next();          // → {value: 11, done: false}     (spec)
                    //   actually returns same in eager model because inner
                    //   is finite, but inner is *already gone* at this point
it.throw("BOOM");   // spec: looks up inner.throw, calls it, observes
                    //   IteratorClose or rethrow
                    // eager: state.index = buf.length; throw "BOOM"
                    //   (inner never sees the throw — it was discarded)
```

For the test262 spy-iterator pattern (`star-rhs-iter-thrw-thrw-invoke.js`),
the spy's `next()` returns `{done: false}` indefinitely, so the eager
drain at the `yield*` site loops until `__EAGER_GEN_LIMIT = 1_000_000`
fires a RangeError — `g()` never returns the generator instance to call
`.throw()` on at all. This is observable today as one of the
`star-rhs-iter-thrw-*` failures returning `RangeError` instead of the
spec-required behavior.

### Why this can't be carved into a slice

The `pendingThrow` field on `_GeneratorState` already exists (added for
synchronous-throw-in-body capture, #1516). One might hope to wire
`__gen_yield_star` to consult it. But `pendingThrow` is set by the
generator body itself when a host-side throw is captured for re-throw on
the next `.next()` — it is not a channel the outer caller can write to,
because the body has already finished by the time the caller sees `iter`.

There is no path that leaves the buffer model intact and satisfies even
one of the 13 `star-rhs-iter-thrw-*` cases. The fix is the move to
generator suspension, owned by #1665 (native generators) + #1042/#1373b
(CPS lowering for the suspend/resume machinery).

### Recommendation

Keep this issue `blocked` on #1665 and #1042. Do **not** spawn another
dev on it. When #1665 lands, this issue's acceptance criteria are
covered by the same lazy-iterator state machine that implements `next()`
properly — `throw`/`return` delegation is a few additional dispatch
arms on the state record's resume handler, not a separate workstream.

## Resume implementation plan — 2026-08-27

The recorded architectural prerequisites are now complete: #1665 and #1042
are `done`, native suspend/resume generators ship in both relevant compiler
paths, and #2170/#2173 implemented native `yield*` delegation for generator
and general iterable subjects. The old “do not spawn” handoff is therefore
stale. Current ES2015 standalone results still contain 13 members of the
`star-rhs-iter-thrw-*` / `star-rhs-iter-thrw-violation-*` family under the
shared complex-native-generator diagnostic, so this issue is reopened for a
bounded protocol-completion slice.

1. Rebuild the exact current ES2015 throw-delegation cohort from the maintained
   11,704-path edition filter. Run every row alone in standalone and host modes
   with the pinned Test262 checkout, QuickJS artifact, LLVM 18, and at most two
   compiler workers; record exact status/signature and confirm which rows now
   route to native versus buffer lowering.
2. Trace the native `yield*` state graph and resume entry for normal, throw, and
   return completions. Partition missing delegate method, getter/call abrupt,
   non-object result, return fallback, and successful forwarding branches.
   Select the largest cohesive native-lowering cluster; do not fold unrelated
   parser, async-generator, or eager-host residuals into its denominator.
3. Implement the shared §14.4.14 throw-completion arms in the live delegation
   state: forward the received value, validate iterator results, perform the
   required return/close fallback when `throw` is absent, and preserve the
   outer generator's continuation and abrupt completion.
4. Add focused host/standalone controls for successful throw forwarding,
   throwing getter/call, non-callable/non-object results, absent-throw return
   fallback, delegate final values, and adjacent normal/return delegation.
5. Rerun the exact cohort and controls in both lanes, native generator/yield-star
   regression suites, same-base pass-to-nonpass comparison, and mandatory
   gates. Record artifacts, counts, root cause, residual ownership, commit SHA,
   and handoff here.

### Resume acceptance

- The current candidate denominator and both-lane baseline are exact.
- The selected cohesive throw-delegation cluster reaches 100% standalone and
  host pass with zero failures, compile errors, timeouts, or skips.
- Normal and return delegation remain green; no eager-host shortcut, fixture
  rewrite, runner exemption, or host-oracle dependency is introduced.
- The upstream PR uses the exact Description/CLA template and remains draft
  until the scoped fix is complete, current-main based, CI-green, and mergeable.

## Progress 2026-09-24 — JS-host lane port (branch `yieldstar-host`)

Standalone already passes all 13 rows on main (#4689's protocol delegation arm,
`emitGenericDelegationState` over the native `__gen_delegate_start/step`
runtime). The JS-host lane still failed all 13 (linked and honest oracle): every
host `function*` containing `yield*` was excluded from native routing
(`bodyHasHostUnsupportedYieldShape`) and fell to the eager `__gen_yield_star`
drain, which never sees `throw()`.

Why this shape, not #5063's: the stale draft (#5063) added a separate
`__iterator_throw` abrupt arm to the old non-protocol state. Main has since
grown a complete protocol state machine (unwind walk, try-region routing,
return completion) — so the host port reuses that emitter and swaps only the
two runtime calls. Reusing the native `__gen_delegate_*` runtime itself in the
host lane was tried first and rejected: it drags in the native-strings stdlib
(`__str_trimStart needs string.len …`) and fails to compile.

- `generators-native.ts`: host `yield*` admitted; a generic-iterable delegate
  takes the protocol arm in both lanes. Native-gen and numeric-vec delegates
  still bail the host generator back to the eager path (unchanged host
  behaviour). The #3050 host try-region bail is lifted only for protocol
  delegates. `nativeDelegates` (the native helper/`executing` reservation) is
  gated to standalone/WASI. The emitter calls `__iterator_strict` +
  `__gen_yield_star_step` in the host lane and yields a plain carrier value
  (`done: 0`) instead of the raw result (`done: -1`).
- `runtime/strict-iterator-host.ts`: `yieldStarStep` — one §14.4.14 step 7
  resumption (next/throw/return) with the same status ABI as the native step.
- `object-ops.ts`: a checker-struct `Object.defineProperty` receiver whose
  physical slot is externref (host) takes the runtime accessor path, so a
  `throw`/`return` getter is visible to the host protocol (ported from #5063,
  narrowed to the JS host).

Measured (`scripts/run-test262-paths.mts --isolate`, same box, base = pristine
`git archive` of the fork point):

| Slice | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 13 `star-rhs-iter-thrw-*` host (honest) | 0/13 | 12/13 |
| same, `TEST262_ORACLE_MODE=linked` | 0/13 | 12/13 |
| same, standalone | 13/13 | 13/13 |
| host control: `expressions/yield`, `statements/generators`, `expressions/generators` (237) | 135 | 164 (+29, 0 lost) |

Standalone output is byte-identical: sha256 of all 237 control rows compiled
`--target standalone` matches base exactly. A string delegate in a numeric
host generator (`yield* 'abc'`) keeps the eager path — the f64 carrier would
unbox the strings to NaN (caught as the one loss in the first control run).

Follow-up (same day, PR #6096 CI): (1) generators NESTED inside a function keep
the eager path when they contain `yield*` — a host for-of over a nested native
generator already fails on main (`[object Object] is not iterable`, reproduced
with no `yield*` at all), so admitting them regressed 3 host equivalence tests
in `generator-yield-delegation.test.ts`. (2) The `__gen_yield_star_step`
adapter now lives in `runtime/strict-iterator-host.ts` (`yieldStarStepImport`),
keeping `runtime.ts` / `resolveImport` at net zero lines for the #4401
host-import-policy budget.

Residual: `star-rhs-iter-thrw-res-done-no-value.js` stays red in host — the
host step reads IteratorValue eagerly for a not-done result, because the host
result struct cannot re-yield the delegate's own result object (standalone
does this with the `done: -1` raw-result sentinel and consumer-side unwrap).
