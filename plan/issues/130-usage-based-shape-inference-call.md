# Issue 130: Usage-based shape inference + call/apply inlining

## Summary

Pre-scan code to infer object shapes from all property assignments/accesses,
generate WasmGC structs matching the inferred shape, and inline
`Array.prototype.X.call(obj, fn)` patterns using the inferred type. Fall back
to a hashmap (`Map<string, any>`) for objects whose shape can't be determined
at compile time (e.g. imported values).

## Motivation

2,200+ test262 Array tests use `Array.prototype.method.call(obj, callback)`
where `obj` is a dynamically-constructed array-like object. Currently all
skipped because we can't compile this pattern. With shape inference, the
compiler sees all property assignments before emitting code and can generate
a matching struct.

Beyond test262, this enables compiling real-world JS/TS patterns:
```typescript
const obj: any = {};
obj.name = "hello";
obj.value = 42;
console.log(obj.name);  // works because shape is known from pre-scan
```

## Design

### Phase 1: Shape pre-pass

Before codegen, walk all statements in the current scope and collect property
accesses per variable:

```
PrePass("var obj = {}; obj.length = 1; obj[0] = 42;")
→ shapes = {
    obj: {
      fields: { length: number },
      indexAccess: { keyType: number, valueType: number },
      usedAs: ["array-like"]
    }
  }
```

For each variable, track:
- Named property assignments: `obj.foo = expr` → field `foo: typeof expr`
- Named property reads: `obj.foo` → field `foo` exists
- Numeric index writes: `obj[i] = expr` → array-like backing store
- Numeric index reads: `obj[i]` → array-like backing store
- String index access: `obj[str]` → needs hashmap fallback
- Usage in `.call()`: `Array.prototype.X.call(obj, ...)` → array-like

### Phase 2: Struct generation

Based on the collected shape, generate a WasmGC struct:

**Array-like shape** (has `.length` + numeric indexing):
```wasm
(type $Shape_arraylike (struct
  (field $length (mut i32))
  (field $elements (mut (ref $i32Array)))
))
```

**Plain object shape** (only named properties):
```wasm
(type $Shape_obj_42 (struct
  (field $name (mut (ref $string)))
  (field $value (mut i32))
))
```

**Mixed shape** (named props + unknown dynamic access):
```wasm
(type $Shape_mixed (struct
  (field $name (mut (ref $string)))       ;; known field
  (field $overflow (mut (ref $HashMap)))  ;; unknown fields
))
```

### Phase 3: `.call()` inlining

When the compiler sees:
```javascript
Array.prototype.indexOf.call(obj, searchElement)
```

And `obj` has array-like shape, inline the method body:
```wasm
;; Inlined indexOf
(local.set $result (i32.const -1))
(block $break
  (loop $loop
    (br_if $break (i32.ge_u (local.get $i) (struct.get $shape $length (local.get $obj))))
    (if (i32.eq
          (array.get $elements (struct.get $shape $elements (local.get $obj)) (local.get $i))
          (local.get $searchElement))
      (then
        (local.set $result (local.get $i))
        (br $break)))
    (local.set $i (i32.add (local.get $i) (i32.const 1)))
    (br $loop)))
```

### Phase 4: HashMap fallback

For objects whose shape can't be determined (imported, `any`-typed, or with
computed string keys), use a `Map<string, AnyValue>` backing store:

```wasm
(type $HashMap (struct
  (field $buckets (ref $array_of_entries))
  (field $size (mut i32))
))
```

Property access on unknown-shape objects:
- `obj.foo` → `hashmap_get(obj.$overflow, "foo")`
- `obj[key]` → `hashmap_get(obj.$overflow, key)` (key must be string)
- `obj.foo = val` → `hashmap_set(obj.$overflow, "foo", box(val))`

This integrates with the `AnyValue` system from #79 — hashmap values are boxed.

## What this unlocks

| Pattern | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `obj.x = 1; obj.y = 2;` | Only works in object literal | Works with any assignment |
| `obj[0] = val; obj.length = n;` | Not supported | Array-like struct |
| `Array.prototype.X.call(obj, fn)` | Skip (374 tests) | Inlined method |
| `imported.unknownProp` | Compile error | HashMap lookup |

## Relationship to existing systems

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| Object literals (#77) | Current: struct from literal `{a: 1}`. Extended: struct from shape inference |
| Gradual typing (#79) | AnyValue boxing for hashmap values |
| Array methods | Already implemented — just need to inline their logic for .call() |

## Implementation phases

1. **Phase 1: Shape pre-pass** — Walk statements, collect property maps per variable.
   ~200 lines in new `src/shape-inference.ts`.

2. **Phase 2: Struct from shape** — Generate WasmGC struct types from inferred shapes.
   ~150 lines extending `src/codegen/index.ts`.

3. **Phase 3: .call() inlining** — Detect `Array.prototype.X.call()` and inline method body.
   ~300 lines in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`.

4. **Phase 4: HashMap fallback** — For unknown shapes, use Map<string, AnyValue>.
   ~200 lines in `src/codegen/index.ts` + `src/codegen/expressions.ts`.

## Complexity

XL — New pre-pass analysis + struct generation from inferred shapes + method
inlining + hashmap fallback. ~850 lines across 4 files. Can be implemented
incrementally: Phase 1-2 alone unlock dynamic property assignment, Phase 3
unlocks test262 Array tests.
