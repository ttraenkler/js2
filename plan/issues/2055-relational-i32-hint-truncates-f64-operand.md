# #2055 — i32-local relational hint truncates the f64 operand

## Problem

When either operand of a relational comparison is an i32-promoted local (loop
vars promoted by `detectI32LoopVar`), the **other** operand gets an i32
`numericHint` and is truncated via `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` before the compare.
`i < 2.5` becomes `i < 2`. Silent wrong branch counts in idiomatic loop code.

## Repro (verified on main)

```ts
export function t1(): number {
  let c = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { if (i < 2.5) c++; }
  return c;
}
export function t2(n: number): number {
  let c = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { if (i < n / 2) c++; }   // n=5
  return c;
}
```

| probe | wasm | node |
|-------|------|------|
| `t1()` | `2` | `3` |
| `t2(5)` | `2` | `3` |
| `2.5 > i` | `2` | `3` |
| `i < n/4` (n=10) | `2` | `3` |
| `i < ("3.5" as any)` | `3` | `4` |

Note: the *for-header* condition `i < 2.5` itself compiles correctly — only
standalone relational expressions (if/ternary/while body) are affected.

## Root cause

`src/codegen/binary-ops.ts` — `hasI32LocalOperand` (~line 1226) sets the
operand `numericHint` to `i32` for any relational op when *either* operand is
an i32 local. The hint is honored in `compileExpression`
(`src/codegen/expressions.ts:686` → `coerceType`), and `coerceType` f64→i32 is
`i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` (`src/codegen/type-coercion.ts:996-998`), so `2.5`/`n/2`
becomes `2` before `i32.lt_s` (dispatch at binary-ops.ts:1600-1610). The
comment claims it "avoids f64 conversion churn in for-loop conditions" but it
also fires on arbitrary comparisons whose other operand is not provably
integral.

## Fix direction

Only use the i32 hint when the non-local operand is provably i32-pure (reuse
`isI32PureExpr`); otherwise promote the i32 local to f64 (`f64.convert_i32_s`
is cheap and exact). Alternatively make the hint advisory for relationals: if
the hinted operand comes back f64, promote rather than truncate.

## Acceptance criteria

- `if (i < 2.5)` / `while (i < x/2)` with i32 loop var match Node
- For-header fast path retains i32 compare when both sides provably integral
- Equivalence suite green; test262 net non-negative

## Dupe check

Grepped `hasI32LocalOperand`, `fractional`, `i32-promoted`, `detectI32LoopVar`,
`truncat` — closest are #1236 (i32 accumulator saturation, done) and #595/#1166
(i32 loop inference). None cover relational truncation.

## Resolution (2026-06-11)

Fixed in `src/codegen/binary-ops.ts`. `hasI32LocalOperand` previously fired the
i32 numeric hint for a relational whenever *either* operand was an i32 local,
truncating a fractional/derived f64 operand via `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` before the
compare. The flag now also requires **both** operands to satisfy `isI32PureExpr`
(which already treats an i32 local as a pure leaf), so it only fires when both
sides are provably integral. The flag was changed to a `let` and assigned after
`isI32PureExpr` is in scope. When the guard fails, the operands stay f64 (the
existing i32↔f64 promotion at binary-ops.ts:1520 converts the i32 local with
`f64.convert_i32_s` — cheap and exact) and an f64 compare is emitted. The
for-header fast path (`i < 10000`, integer bound) and two-i32-local compares
still take the i32 path.

### Test Results

`tests/issue-2055.test.ts` (8 cases, all PASS):

| case | result |
|------|--------|
| `if (i < 2.5)` | 3 ✓ |
| `if (i < n/2)` (n=5) | 3 ✓ |
| `if (2.5 > i)` (literal left) | 3 ✓ |
| `<=`, `>`, `>=` with 2.5 | 3 / 2 / 2 ✓ |
| `while (i < x/2)` + ternary | 3 / 3 ✓ |
| `if (i < 3)` integer fast path (unregressed) | 3 ✓ |
| two i32 locals `i < j` (unregressed) | 3 ✓ |
| `for (i<10000)` perf path intact | 10000 ✓ |

`tsc --noEmit` clean. Pre-existing failures in `tests/i32-loop-inference.test.ts`,
`tests/native-i32-type.test.ts`, etc. are unrelated — those harnesses call
`compile()` without `await` or use a minimal import object missing
`string_constants`; they fail identically on baseline with this change reverted.
