# #443 -- Expected runtime ReferenceError but execution succeeded (6 fail)

## Problem

6 tests expect a ReferenceError to be thrown at runtime (e.g., accessing an undeclared variable) but the compiled Wasm code executes successfully without error.

This means the compiler is silently resolving references that should be unresolvable at runtime, likely by:
- Defaulting undeclared variables to undefined/0 instead of throwing
- Resolving TDZ (temporal dead zone) variables as if they were initialized
- Not implementing ReferenceError for missing global properties

## Priority: low (6 tests)

## Complexity: XS

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Undeclared variable access produces a runtime trap or error
- [ ] TDZ violations produce appropriate errors
- [ ] All 6 expected-ReferenceError tests pass
