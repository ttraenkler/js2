# Issue #354: Reflect.construct (120 skip)

## Problem

120 tests were being skipped because they had `Reflect`, `Reflect.construct`, or `Reflect.apply` in their feature tags. Many of these tests do not actually use Reflect in their source code -- they are tagged because the spec internally references Reflect (e.g., for class constructors), but the test code itself works fine without Reflect support.

## Solution

Applied the same pattern used for Symbol: removed `Reflect`, `Reflect.construct`, and `Reflect.apply` from the `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES` set in `test262-runner.ts`, and added a source-level check that only skips tests when the actual test body contains `\bReflect\b`.

## Implementation Summary

**What was done:**
- Removed "Reflect", "Reflect.construct", "Reflect.apply" from the UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES set
- Added a source-level Reflect check (matching the existing Symbol pattern) that strips the YAML metadata block and only skips if the test body actually references Reflect

**Files changed:**
- `tests/test262-runner.ts`

**What worked:**
- Direct application of the Symbol narrowing pattern to Reflect

**Tests:**
- Existing tests pass with no regressions
- Tests tagged with Reflect features but not using Reflect in source are now unblocked
