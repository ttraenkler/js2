# #516 — struct.new argument count mismatch in class constructors (1,781 CE)

## Status: in-review
1,781 tests fail Wasm validation because `struct.new` is called with the wrong number of arguments. The compiler emits fewer arguments than the struct type requires.

Mostly in class constructors (`C_new`, `__anonClass_0_new`). The struct has fields from the class hierarchy (inherited + own + private) but the constructor doesn't push values for all of them.

## Categories affected
- `language/statements/class` + `language/expressions/class` dominate

## Complexity: M

## Implementation Summary

### Root cause
Fields can be dynamically added to struct type definitions during expression compilation
(via `typeDef.fields.push(newField)` at three sites in `expressions.ts`). This happens
when a property access or assignment encounters a field that exists in the TS type system
but wasn't captured during the initial class struct registration. Since constructors are
compiled before other function bodies, the constructor's `struct.new` instruction pushes
fewer values than the struct type ultimately requires, causing Wasm validation failure.

### Fix: post-compilation fixup pass (`fixupStructNewArgCounts`)
Added a fixup pass that runs after `compileDeclarations` in `generateModule`. It:

1. Builds a reverse map from struct type index to class name
2. Scans all function bodies (recursively into nested blocks) for `struct.new` instructions
3. For class struct types, counts backwards from `struct.new` to find how many default-value
   instructions were already pushed
4. If fewer defaults than the struct's actual field count, splices in additional defaults
   for the missing fields (those added dynamically at the end)

Guard: only fixes when `pushedCount > 0` to avoid interfering with non-constructor
`struct.new` patterns (like Object.create).

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — added `fixupStructNewArgCounts` function and call site

### Tests
- Added `tests/issue-516.test.ts` with 10 test cases covering:
  - Basic class construction
  - Classes with only property declarations (no constructor)
  - Three-level inheritance chains
  - Child class without explicit constructor
  - Methods-only classes
  - Computed property names
  - Property initializers with constructor params
  - Property set outside constructor
  - Compound assignment on property
