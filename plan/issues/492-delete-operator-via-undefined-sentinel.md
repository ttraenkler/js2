# #492 — delete operator via undefined sentinel (288 tests)

## Status: open

288 tests skipped because they use the `delete` operator. WasmGC structs have fixed fields that can't be removed, but we can simulate deletion.

## Approach

`delete obj.prop` in JS removes the property. In WasmGC we can't remove struct fields, but we can:

1. Set the field to a sentinel value (null ref or NaN-boxed undefined)
2. `hasOwnProperty("prop")` checks against the sentinel (returns false if deleted)
3. Property access on a deleted field returns `undefined`

### Implementation
1. `delete obj.prop` → `struct.set obj $prop (ref.null)` or undefined sentinel
2. Property access checks: if field is sentinel, return undefined
3. `"prop" in obj` and `hasOwnProperty` check against sentinel
4. Only works for own properties (not prototype, but we don't have prototype chain anyway)

### Limitations
- Can't delete array elements (use `arr[i] = undefined` semantics)
- Can't delete variables (`delete x` in non-strict mode) — always returns false
- `delete` on non-configurable properties — always returns false

~50% of the 288 tests should pass with this approach. The rest test prototype chain deletion or non-configurable property edge cases.

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `delete obj.prop` sets field to sentinel
- [ ] `obj.prop` returns undefined after delete
- [ ] `"prop" in obj` returns false after delete
- [ ] `obj.hasOwnProperty("prop")` returns false after delete
