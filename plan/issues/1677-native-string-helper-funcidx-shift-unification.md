## Problem

Under `--target wasi` (auto `nativeStrings`), several constructs emit a
`.wasm` that **fails `WebAssembly.compile` validation** because the native
string helpers `__str_flatten` / `__str_to_extern` are called with arguments
of the wrong Wasm type:

```
Compiling function #N:"__str_flatten"  failed: call[k] expected type <T>, found <U>
Compiling function #N:"__str_to_extern" failed: call[0] expected type f64, found local.get
```

Reproducers (probes live in `.tmp/probes-1666/`):

| Probe | Error |
|---|---|
| `array-map` (`.map().filter().reduce()`) | `__str_flatten` call[0] expected i32, found local.get |
| `class` (`extends`/`super`) | `__str_flatten` call[1] expected externref, found i31 |
| `closure` (captured local) | `__str_flatten` call[0] expected i32, found local.get |
| `str-replace-re` | `__str_flatten` call[1] mismatch |
| `str-template` (`` `${x}` ``) | `__str_to_extern` call[0] expected f64, found local |
| `generator` | `__str_flatten` type error |

## Root cause (confirmed during #1666 investigation)

There are **two independent func-index shift regimes** that are not reconciled
with each other:

1. **Finalize-phase eager helper emission.** Native string helpers
   (`__str_flatten`, `__str_to_extern`, etc.) are emitted as DEFINED functions
   during the import-collection finalize phase
   (`finalizeUnifiedCollector` → `ensureNativeStringHelpers`). Later finalize
   blocks call raw `addImport`, which bumps `numImportFuncs` **without**
   shifting the already-emitted helper bodies' internal `call`/`ref.func`
   targets — so those targets become stale and resolve to wrong-signature
   functions.

2. **Compilation-phase late-import shift.** The lazy `__str_to_extern` bridge
   (`ensureNativeStringExternBridge`, emitted during function COMPILATION via
   `ensureLateImport` / `flushLateImportShifts`) operates under a *second*
   shift regime that overlaps with the first.

An incremental, finalize-scoped `addImport` shift (gated on a pinned helper
base so the default GC path is never touched) fixes ~6/8 probes (array-map,
class, closure, generator, numstr, uint8) **but** the
compilation-phase `__str_to_extern` bridge overlaps with that second shift
regime — `str-template` still fails, and gating the finalize shift to the
finalize phase alone regresses class/uint8.

## The #618 hazard (why this is NOT a localized fix)

This is exactly the failure mode that forced the **#618 revert** of PR #608.
#608 added an eager `fixupModuleFuncIndices(ctx, threshold, 1)` inside
`addImport`, gated only by `pendingLateImportShift === null &&
!suppressFuncIndexFixup` — **not** by target or `nativeStrings`. So it fired
in the default JS-host GC path. When late imports are added one-by-one
(outside the batched `flushLateImportShifts` route), it re-shifted `call`
indices in **already-emitted** function bodies, shifting away the `call` that
pushes `Math.abs`'s argument and leaving `f64.abs` with an empty stack —
**−3,931 test262 (29,355 → 25,743 pass)**, virtually all `assert.sameValue`
calls in the harness.

Any fix for Signature A that introduces a func-index shift inside `addImport`
MUST NOT be able to fire on the default GC trampoline path. The naive
"shift on addImport" approach is precisely what regressed.

## What an architect-level fix looks like

The correct full fix **unifies the two shift regimes** so a helper emitted in
either phase (finalize-phase eager helper emission vs. compilation-phase
`flushLateImportShifts`) is reconciled consistently, without double-shift and
without ever re-shifting a body already emitted with final indices. Candidate
shapes to evaluate:

- **Single deferred-resolution pass.** Emit ALL helper `call`/`ref.func`
  targets as symbolic references (not concrete indices) during both phases,
  and resolve them in one final pass once `numImportFuncs` is frozen. This
  removes the "shift already-emitted bodies" problem entirely — nothing is
  shifted because nothing was concrete until the end.
- **Reserve a fixed helper import band.** Pre-allocate the native-string
  helper indices at a known base *before* any user function is compiled, so
  later `addImport` calls never push into the helper band. The finalize-phase
  helpers and the compilation-phase bridge would both target the reserved
  band; no shifting needed.
- **Pin + suppress on the default path.** Whatever shift exists must be hard-
  gated on `ctx.wasi || ctx.standalone` (or `ctx.nativeStrings`) AND on a
  pinned helper base, so it is provably inert on the default GC path. This is
  the minimum bar to avoid re-triggering #618.

Each option needs the architect to trace the exact ordering of
`finalizeUnifiedCollector`, `ensureNativeStringHelpers`,
`ensureNativeStringExternBridge`, `ensureLateImport`, `flushLateImportShifts`,
and `addImport` and choose the one that does not introduce a re-shift hazard.

## Investigation starting points

- `src/codegen/native-strings.ts` — `__str_flatten`, `__str_to_extern`
  emitters; `ensureNativeStringHelpers`, `ensureNativeStringExternBridge`.
- `src/codegen/registry/imports.ts` — `addImport`, `fixupModuleFuncIndices`
  (the #608 regression site).
- `src/codegen/expressions/late-imports.ts` — `ensureLateImport`,
  `flushLateImportShifts`, `shiftLateImportIndices`.
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — `finalizeUnifiedCollector`, `addUnionImports`
  (documents the "must also shift `ctx.currentFunc.body`" rule in CLAUDE.md).

## Acceptance criteria

1. All 6 Signature A probes (`array-map`, `class`, `closure`, `str-replace-re`,
   `str-template`, `generator`) compile to **valid**, instantiable modules
   under `--target wasi` and `--target standalone`.
2. **No regression on the default GC path** — the #618 `Math.abs` harness
   corruption MUST NOT recur. A default-mode `Math.abs` + string-concat
   snippet must validate, and CI test262 must hold the default-path pass
   count (the authoritative gate — the bisect that caught #608 was the
   merge-group test262 shards).
3. `tests/issue-1677.test.ts` covering each probe shape, both modes.
4. equivalence tests green in both modes.

## Out of scope

- Signature B (unbound late global) — already re-landed via PR #684 (#1666).
- Residual host-import leak elimination — #1664.
- Native generators shared `$Iterator` design — #1665.
- Pure-Wasm number→string lowering — #1335.

## Resolution (2026-05-27, senior-developer) — partial, PR open

**Fixed 3 of 6 Signature A probes: `class` (extends/super), `closure`
(captured local), `generator` (for-of).** The func-index shift unification is
implemented as `reconcileNativeStrFinalizeShift`
(`src/codegen/expressions/late-imports.ts`), called at two points in
`generateModule` / `generateMultiModule` finalize.

Root cause confirmed by instrumentation: the native-string helpers AND their
dependency helpers (`__box_number`, `__unbox_number`, … emitted via
`addUnionImportsAsNativeFuncs`) are eagerly emitted during finalize while
`numImportFuncs == base`. Finalize then adds more imports (string methods,
parseInt, Promise statics) which bump every defined function's absolute Wasm
index by `added`, but the baked sibling-call targets, the `funcMap` entries, and
the export descriptors were left stale-low. `__vec_get` (emitted later) read a
stale-low `funcMap.get("__box_number")` and called the wrong function
(`call[k] not enough arguments on the stack`).

The fix applies ONE **uniform** `+added` shift to all eagerly-emitted defined
functions' bodies, their `funcMap` entries (gated on the name being a defined
function so the freshly-added imports in `[base, base+added)` are not
double-shifted), `nativeStrHelpers`, and func exports — for `funcIdx >= base`
only. An earlier version restricted the shift to `nativeStrHelpers`-named
functions, which left `__box_number` stale and produced the `__vec_get`
over-/under-shift; the uniform shift is the correct generalization (it mirrors
the JS-host path's late-import fixup at `addUnionImports`).

**#618 safety verified:** `base` is set only inside `ensureNativeStringHelpers`
(native-strings path). On the default JS-host GC path it stays -1 and the
reconcile is a hard no-op. Confirmed: a default-mode `Math.abs` + string-concat
snippet still validates (covered by `tests/issue-1677.test.ts`).

**Tests:** `tests/issue-1677.test.ts` — 4/4 (class/closure/generator valid under
wasi + the #618 default-GC guard). `tests/wasi.test.ts` green.

### Out of scope — carve to follow-up (still failing, distinct root causes)

Not func-index shift bugs; left for a follow-up:

- **`str-template`** (`` `${x}` ``) — `__str_to_extern call[0] expected f64,
  found i32`. Instrumented: at emit time `numImportFuncs==1`, `__str_flatten` is
  at index 2 and the baked `flattenIdx==2` is *correct*; no shift occurs
  (`added==0` at every reconcile). The mismatch is a **type/codegen** problem in
  the `ensureNativeStringExternBridge` body, not an index shift.
- **`array-map`** (`.map().filter().reduce()`) — `__module_init call[1]
  expected (ref null 5), found global.get f64`. The same signature reproduces
  with a minimal `Math.abs(-5)` + `"x"+a` snippet under `--target wasi`, so it is
  a **string-constant-global materialized as f64** problem
  (Signature-B-adjacent), independent of the helper func-index regime.

Recommend a follow-up issue for these two.

### Pre-existing (NOT this change)

`tests/imported-string-constants.test.ts` has 10 failing e2e cases on main
(`LinkError: env __box_number requires a callable`). Verified identical failure
count with the reconcile gated off — pre-existing, unrelated to this fix.
