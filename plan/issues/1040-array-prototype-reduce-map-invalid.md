# #1040 — 17 Array reduce/map tests regress with invalid Wasm binary after #1030

## Problem

After PR #77 (#1030 — Array.prototype long-tail dispatch) merged, **17 previously-passing test262 tests regressed**, concentrated in:

- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/reduce` — 9 regressions
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/map` — 7 regressions
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/filter` — 1 regression

All 17 fail with:
- 10 × `invalid Wasm binary (WebAssembly.instantiate(): Compiling function #N:"__..."`
- 4 × `compile_timeout`
- 3 × assertion failures that are downstream of the above

Net delta of #1030 was still strongly positive (+112 pass overall, 129 improvements vs 17 regressions) so PR #77 was merged and this narrow bucket filed as a targeted follow-up.

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§23.1.3.22 Array.prototype.reduce](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.reduce) — steps 7-8: callbackfn called with (accumulator, kValue, k, O)
- [§23.1.3.17 Array.prototype.map](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.map) — step 6: callbackfn called with (kValue, k, O)


## Root cause hypothesis

dev-1030's extension of `compileArrayLikePrototypeCall` in `src/codegen/array-methods.ts` added coverage for reduce / map / reduceRight via a new dispatch path. The 17 failing tests likely exercise a specific callback signature or accumulator shape that the new path emits as invalid Wasm (mis-typed local, missing ref cast, or wrong function type index).

The compile_timeout cases suggest one of the emit paths may have entered an unbounded codegen loop for specific input shapes.

## Investigation

1. Sample 3-4 of the failing tests:
   - `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/reduce/*.js`
   - `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/map/*.js`
2. Compile each one with tracing to isolate which emit path produces the invalid Wasm
3. Compare the WAT output of a passing vs regressing test in the same directory to locate the divergence
4. Check whether the regression is:
   - A new dispatch path (new code in compileArrayLikePrototypeCall's reduce branch)
   - A shared helper used by both old and new paths where the type narrowing changed
   - A late-import registration that's missing for the reduce-specific path

## Fix

Likely a narrow correction in `src/codegen/array-methods.ts` around the reduce/map accumulator or callback signature handling. Target one of:

- Missing `ref.cast` on an accumulator value
- Wrong function type index on the callback `call_ref`
- Missing late-import registration for a helper only used in the reduce path
- A type mismatch when the callback returns a different type than the accumulator

## Expected impact

**+17 pass** (restore the regressions). Some of the compile_timeouts may also resolve to pass once the invalid Wasm issue is fixed — they're likely symptom not cause.

## Key files

- `src/codegen/array-methods.ts` — `compileArrayLikePrototypeCall` reduce/map branches (dev-1030 holds the lock)
- `src/runtime.ts` — any `__call_fn_*` or `__reduce_*` helpers

## Acceptance criteria

- All 17 previously-regressing tests flip back to pass
- No new regressions introduced
- Scoped test in `tests/issue-1040.test.ts`
