# #907 -- Replace `__init_done` runtime guards with start/init entry semantics

## Problem

For module-init-only programs, the compiler currently emits a runtime guard global:

```wat
(global $__init_done (mut i32) (i32.const 0))
```

This came up with the example:

```ts
function squared(n) {
  return n * n;
}

let result = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
  result += squared(10);
}

console.log(result);
```

Even though the program is effectively "run module initialization once", the emitted module shape still carries `__init_done` machinery intended to guard exported execution paths.

That decision should not be deferred to runtime when the compiler already knows the module has:

- top-level executable statements
- no explicit exported `main()`
- a single intended initialization sequence

Using a Wasm `start` function, or an explicit compile-time-selected init entry, would be simpler than carrying runtime guard state into the emitted module.

## Goal

Move one-time module initialization to a compile/load-time entry strategy instead of preserving `__init_done` runtime guard state in emitted modules.

## Requirements

1. Distinguish module-init-only programs from explicit exported-entry programs at compile time
2. Prefer a start/init entry strategy over `__init_done` globals and injected guard preambles where supported
3. Keep runtime behavior deterministic for playground and non-playground consumers
4. Preserve cases where explicit guarded exports are still actually required
5. Add regression coverage using the example above

## Acceptance criteria

- the example above no longer emits `__init_done`
- init-once behavior still works correctly
- exported-entry programs keep correct semantics
- runtime setup becomes simpler and less guard-oriented for module-init-only code

## Test Results

### Sample from the issue (module-init-only)
```ts
function squared(n) { return n * n; }
let result = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) { result += squared(10); }
console.log(result);
```
- Binary no longer contains `__init_done` global ✓
- Binary now uses Wasm `start` section: `(start <idx>)` ✓
- No `_start` export wrapper (init runs automatically on instantiate) ✓
- Top-level code executes during `WebAssembly.instantiate()` and prints `1000000` ✓

### `tests/issue-907.test.ts`
8 / 8 new tests pass — covers module-init-only, exports + top-level, main()
prepended init, pure exports, WASI mode, and "init runs exactly once" semantics.

### Equivalence regression check
- main: 106 failed | 1185 passed (1291)
- branch: 106 failed | 1185 passed (1291)
- exact same set of failing test files; no new regressions

### Bug found and fixed during implementation
Late-added union imports via `addUnionImports` shift defined-function indices
but did NOT update `ctx.mod.startFuncIdx`, causing `(start 0)` to point at the
wrong function and trip `WebAssembly.validate()`. Now also remapped alongside
`declaredFuncRefs` and table elements.

## Implementation

`src/codegen/declarations.ts` — when a module has top-level executable
statements but no user-declared `main()`, the compiler now emits an unexported
`__module_init` function and (for non-WASI targets) sets
`ctx.mod.startFuncIdx = initFuncIdx`. The Wasm engine runs the start function
once during instantiation, before any export becomes callable. This replaces
both the legacy `__init_done` runtime guard with per-export guard preambles
*and* the `_start` export wrapper for module-init-only programs.

For WASI targets, `addWasiStartExport` continues to create a `_start` export
wrapping `__module_init`; `startFuncIdx` is intentionally NOT set so the WASI
host's explicit `_start` invocation remains the single entry point (otherwise
init would run twice).

Supporting changes:

- `src/ir/types.ts` — added `startFuncIdx?: number` to `WasmModule`.
- `src/emit/binary.ts` — emit Wasm start section (id 8) between Export and
  Element when `startFuncIdx` is set.
- `src/emit/wat.ts` — emit `(start <idx>)` directive after exports.
- `src/codegen/dead-elimination.ts` — mark `startFuncIdx` as a function root
  (so dead-import elimination keeps `__module_init`) and remap it after the
  function-index renumber.
- `src/codegen/index.ts` (`addUnionImports`) — shift `startFuncIdx` alongside
  the existing `declaredFuncRefs` / element-segment / call-instruction shifts.
- `playground/main.ts` — the playground no longer synthesizes a fake `main()`
  for "exports + top-level" sources, and no longer calls `_start()` for
  module-init-only sources. With the start section, init runs during
  `instantiateWasm()` and the playground simply reports
  "Executed top-level statements during module instantiation."
- `tests/issue-907.test.ts` — regression coverage.
