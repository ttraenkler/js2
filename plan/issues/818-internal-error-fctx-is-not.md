# #818 -- Internal error: fctx is not defined during compilation

## Problem

Test262 tests fail with `Internal error compiling expression: fctx is not defined`. This means the compiler accesses `fctx` (FunctionContext) in a code path where it's not in scope.

## Root Cause

`buildClosureCallInstrs` in `src/codegen/array-methods.ts` referenced `fctx` on lines 2277, 2293, 2298, and 2302 without having it as a parameter. This is a standalone function (not a closure), so `fctx` was a ReferenceError at runtime. The same issue existed in `buildCallAndCheck` which called `buildClosureCallInstrs`.

The bug manifested when array methods (forEach, filter, map, find, findIndex, some, every) were used with closure callbacks that needed type coercion for their parameters or had funcref casts.

## Fix

Added `fctx: FunctionContext` parameter to:
- `buildClosureCallInstrs` (line 2266)
- `buildCallAndCheck` (line 2418)

Updated all 5 call sites to pass `fctx` through from the calling function.

## Files Changed

- `src/codegen/array-methods.ts` -- added fctx parameter to buildClosureCallInstrs and buildCallAndCheck
- `tests/issue-818.test.ts` -- 7 equivalence tests covering forEach, filter, map, find, some, every with closure callbacks

## Verification

- All 7 new tests pass
- 1200 existing equivalence tests: 1145 pass, 55 fail (all pre-existing failures unrelated to this change)
