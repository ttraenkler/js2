# #3178 — UMBRELLA: standalone host async-machinery retirement

## 2026-07-23 (fable-3417) — post-F2 honest-FAIL head fixed: #3538

With the F2 async-completion channel landed (#3469) the standalone async
corpus scores honestly; the single biggest newly-scored FAIL bucket was the
**280-test** `yield-star-{getiter,next}-*` error-semantics template family
(one error string, 35 templates × 8 contexts). Measure-first collapsed it to
THREE coupled root causes — uncaught-throw did not complete the generator
frame; no leads-free completion target existed (also a latent #3389 bug);
`{done, value}` destructure off a native IteratorResult read
undefined/undefined — fixed in child **#3538** (done): synthetic COMPLETED
dispatch arm + catch/driver retarget + done/value destructure routed through
the #2674 `__get_member_<name>` dispatcher + canonical-undefined done-result
value. Probed 70/70 PASS on a stride-4 cohort sample. Residuals noted in
#3538: untyped member reads `r.done` still leak legacy `__gen_result_*` host
imports (separate pre-existing cohort), sync-gen STATIC typed reads surface
0/1 / NaN.

Second head, same day: the ~130-row `Cannot destructure/access/convert`
cluster (98 for-await-dstr) was a DECOY message — the real defect is that
every synchronously-unwinding standalone async-fn throw rejected with a
**NULL reason** (`wrapAsyncCallInTryCatch`'s standalone arm never wired the
#1326 Phase-1C catch-payload; the handler's own destructure-of-null
manufactured the corpus message). Fixed in child **#3542** (done): a
`catch $exn` arm uses the tag payload as the rejection reason. Probed 30/33
PASS on a stride-4 cluster sample; 3 residuals =
`language/arguments-object/*async-gen*` (`Cannot access property on null or
undefined`) — distinct root cause, still open here.

## Decomposition 2026-07-17 (fable-3178) — child issues #3386–#3391

State change since this umbrella was written (2026-07-12): **S1 (#3164), S2
(#3132), S3 (#3302), S4 (#3228), S5/S6 (#2903) have all landed/closed** — but
#3132 closed after its own S1+S2 only, banking its S3 (general `yield*`) and
S4 (`return` completion) unspun. Also the ACCOUNTING changed: since #2961 a
standalone compile that emits host imports is a hard `compile_error`
(`error_category: host_import_leak`) — there are no "leaky passes" anymore.
Every pass is host-free (24,949 on the 2026-07-17 promoted baseline — the
host_free_pass ≥ 24,500 acceptance bar is MET); the residual family scope is
now the **4,410 official-scope `host_import_leak` CE rows**, i.e. potential
NEW passes, re-measured 2026-07-17 and decomposed into six children:

| Child     | Scope (one line)                                                                                                                    |   Rows |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----: |
| **#3386** | sync-gen destructuring-pattern params: fn-expr gate, element defaults, untyped array patterns via native iterator protocol, methods | ~1,860 |
| **#3387** | NESTED async-gens with for-await bodies — close the nested-vs-module-scope drivability seam (owns the seam root-cause)              |   ~577 |
| **#3388** | async-gen general `yield*` runtime delegation (nested + method lanes, §27.6.3.7 GetIterator error semantics) — #3132 S3 re-grounded |   ~600 |
| **#3389** | async-gen `return`/`throw` completion — settleReturn terminator + driven `.return()`/`.throw()` — #3132 S4 re-grounded              |   ~300 |
| **#3390** | Promise combinators with non-Promise receivers (`.call(nonCtor)` TypeError, custom-ctor admission)                                  |   ~119 |
| **#3391** | S7 mechanical closeout: registration assert, dead-arm audit, umbrella acceptance measurement (depends on the rest)                  |      0 |

**The load-bearing new finding (probe matrix 2026-07-17)**: for-await bodies,
general `yield*` (ident AND custom async-iterable), and `return` completion in
async gens all compile HOST-FREE at module scope on current main, but LEAK
when the generator is nested inside a function — and the test262 runner wraps
every file in `export function test(){}`, so the whole async-gen residual
rides that one seam (`nested-declarations.ts:678/:1104` →
`isAsyncGenDriveCandidate` → `analyzeAsyncGen`'s bounded shape). #3387 owns
root-causing which module-scope arm admits these (and validating its runtime
correctness — it is corpus-under-tested precisely because everything is
wrapped); #3388/#3389 build on the documented finding. `__make_callback` is
fully retired (0 rows). Dynamic-import chains (288 rows) stay deferred
(#1089/#1512). Remaining non-family leak cohorts (SharedArrayBuffer 344,
BigInt64Array, `__array_from_async` 76, …) are OUTSIDE this umbrella.

## The one-paragraph thesis

The standalone lane's single largest lever (~10.3 pts host-free) is retiring
the `env::__create_generator` / `__gen_*` / `__create_async_generator` /
`Promise_*` / `__make_callback` / `__get_caught_exception` host-import family.
**The native substrate already exists and is NOT the gap**: the microtask
ring, the `$Promise` carrier, native `.then/.catch/.finally`, the combinators,
thenable assimilation, `new Promise(inline executor)`, and the N-state
generator resume machine are all live on current main (inventory below,
grounded file:line). The gap is **admission coverage**: shapes that bail the
native gates fall to the legacy eager-buffer / host-CPS lowerings, and THOSE
drag the whole import bundle in. This umbrella is (a) the measured
decomposition of the 4,467 leaky passes into slices, (b) the substrate design
answers each slice depends on, and (c) the classification/ranking so the
family can be staffed without re-deriving any of this.

**Key correction to the gap map's Promise row**: the `Promise_then2/resolve/
reject` ~1,500 column is NOT an independent Promise gap — probe-verified on
current main, `Promise.resolve(1).then(v=>v).catch(e=>e)`,
`Promise.all([...])`, `.allSettled`, `.finally` all compile with **zero env
imports** under `--target standalone`. The Promise imports in the baseline
co-occur with `__create_async_generator` in >90% of rows: they are the
async-gen HOST fallback minting host promises. Retiring #3132 retires them.
#2903's independent remainder is the 182-row cohort (re-grounded in #2903).

`__get_caught_exception` (4,106 rows) is registered together with the eager
generator bundle (`registerGeneratorHostImports`, `src/codegen/index.ts:11798`)
and per-site by the HOST-lane async wrap (`src/codegen/expressions.ts:543`,
`wrapAsyncCallInTryCatch` — the standalone arm at expressions.ts:516 already
avoids it). It has **no independent existence**: it disappears exactly when
the eager/host-CPS paths stop being emitted. Do not fix it directly.

## Substrate inventory — what is ALREADY native (verified on main @ 6dcdf30135)

Devs picking up any slice: these are the primitives you compose. Do NOT build
parallel machinery.

1. **Microtask/job queue** — `src/codegen/async-scheduler.ts` (#1326 1C-A):
   funcref+externref ring (`__microtask_enqueue` / `__drain_microtasks` /
   `__microtask_grow`), uniform job signature `$__mt_func_type
(externref, externref) -> externref`, WASI `_start` auto-drain, plus the
   #2632 timer-heap/run-loop reactor. This IS the spec HostEnqueuePromiseJob.
2. **`$Promise` carrier** — `getOrRegisterPromiseType` (async-scheduler.ts):
   `{state i32 mut, value externref mut, callbacks (ref null $PromiseCallback) mut}`;
   settle primitives `__promise_fulfill` / `__promise_reject` /
   `__promise_resolve_value` (recursive thenable adoption, #2867 Gap 1);
   executor settle-closures `ensurePromiseExecutorClosures` (#2959/#3125).
3. **Native `.then/.catch/.finally`** — then-wrappers + `$PromiseCallback`
   reaction list (async-scheduler.ts 1C-B), `.finally` per §27.2.5.3
   (`ensurePromiseFinallyRuntime`, #2903). Bridge arms in
   `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` (`emitStandaloneThenWithNativeFallback`).
4. **Combinators** — `src/codegen/promise-combinators.ts`: native
   `all/race/allSettled/any` over array-literal, array-typed, Set/Map, and
   dynamic args (`__combinator_to_vec`), native `AggregateError` (#2867 Gap 4,
   #2919, #2922, #3137).
5. **Sync generator N-state resume machine** — `src/codegen/generators-native.ts`:
   `buildNativeGeneratorPlan` (line 482) lowers loops/ifs, try/catch/finally
   ACROSS yields (#3050 throw-routes + pending-completion), `yield*`
   delegation (generator / vec / general-iterable, #2170/#2173), pattern
   params (#2920), string/any yield carriers (#2171/#2864). Admission gate:
   `isNativeGeneratorCandidate` (line 1850); host-import registration mirror:
   `sourceNeedsGeneratorHostImports` (line 2066) — these two MUST stay in
   lockstep (the single-source-of-truth discipline every slice must keep).
6. **Async drive + async-gen frame** — `src/codegen/async-cps.ts`
   (`analyzeAsyncGen`), `src/codegen/async-frame.ts`, #2906 multi-state CFG
   resume + #2865 `$AsyncFrame` carrier + per-gen `__async_gen_next_<stem>`
   drivers; #3132 S1 landed the `yield*`-array-literal unroll + the
   ITER_KIND_ASYNCGEN consumer arm in `src/codegen/iterator-native.ts`.
7. **Exception payload capture, host-free** — the native `__exn` tag
   (`ensureExnTag`, `src/codegen/registry/imports.ts`) carries the thrown
   value as an externref payload through `try`/`catch_all`; standalone catch
   arms read it directly (the standalone arm of `wrapAsyncCallInTryCatch`,
   expressions.ts:516–541, and the #3050 catch-param spill model,
   generators-native.ts:759–781). This is the `__get_caught_exception`
   replacement — already built.

**Design answer to "can standalone reuse the #2906 N-state machine?": it
already does.** The native sync-gen and async-gen paths ARE the #2906 machine;
there is no second machine to build. Every slice below is an admission-gate
widening or a consumer-arm fill on machines 5/6, or a producer-proof on
machines 2/3.

extends). S7 last. S1+S2 alone retire ~4,000 of 4,467 — **the family's 90%.**

### S3 design notes (capturing generators — the opus-review part)

`generatorCapturesOuterScope` (generators-native.ts:2001) bails any generator
nested in a function that reads an enclosing binding — and the test262 module
wrapper puts tests inside `export function test(){}`, so wrapped tests with
named generators touching test-scope vars are ALL eager (this is also #3032's
root observation: the eager body runs at CREATION, violating §27.5.3.1
EvaluateBody — a generator must suspend before any body statement runs).
Design direction (needs opus review before staffing):

- The compiler already has the mutable-capture representation: **ref cells**
  (`struct (field $value (mut T))`) threaded by `src/codegen/closures.ts`.
  Extend the native generator state struct with N extra immutable fields
  holding the captured ref cells (captured-by-reference, so writes inside the
  generator stay visible outside — the eager path got this via the host
  buffer's by-value snapshot, which is itself subtly WRONG for post-creation
  mutation; native cells fix that too). The factory
  (`registerNativeGenerator` / the #3164 fn-expr variant) receives the cells
  as extra args exactly like `compileArrowAsClosure` captures do.
- Gate relaxation must move `generatorCapturesOuterScope` from "bail" to
  "collect capture list" in BOTH `isNativeGeneratorCandidate` and
  `sourceNeedsGeneratorHostImports` in the same commit (lockstep rule).
- Read-only uses of module globals already work (not captures). The risk
  surface is captured-binding read/write ordering across suspends — the
  ref-cell indirection makes each access go through the cell, so suspends are
  transparent.
- Coordinate with **#3032** (`ready`, unassigned — the "in-progress fable-tag5"
  label above was stale as of the 2026-07-16 PO groom): #3032 makes the eager
  path LAZY (semantics fix keeping the host path); S3 makes captures NATIVE
  (leak fix). If S3 lands first, #3032's remaining scope shrinks to the
  shapes S1+S3 still exclude. Whoever lands second re-measures.

**Groomed 2026-07-16 (PO pass): spun off as #3302** — full design notes above
carried into that issue file verbatim, with line numbers re-verified against
current `main` (the `generators-native.ts:2001` citation above pre-dates the
#3271 god-file split; #3302 cites the current locations).

### S4 design notes (for-await-of dstr legacy async lowering)

The 90 leaky files (`language/statements/for-await-of/async-func-dstr-*`) are
async FUNCTIONS whose body shape (for-await + destructuring binding) bails the
#2906 native drive and falls to a legacy lowering that emits `__make_callback`
continuations + `Promise_resolve/reject/then2` + `__get_caught_exception`.
Probe-verified on current main 2026-07-12: `for await (const x of [1,2,3])`,
over a sync generator, and over `[Promise.resolve(1)]` are ALL already
host-free — the bail is specifically the dstr BINDING form inside for-await
(see also #2602: for-await assignment-rest write unimplemented). Fix
direction: widen the async-drive admission the way #3132's consumer arm did —
the dstr binding lowers through the existing sync `__iterator` +
IteratorBindingInitialization path once the awaited step value is settled; no
new machinery. Ground in `src/codegen/async-cps.ts` (the async-fn drive gate)
before writing the child issue.

**Groomed 2026-07-16 (PO pass): #3228 (done) banked the 24 array-source
files of this 90-file bucket.** #3228's own scope note punts the remaining
~96 `asyncIter`-var-source files to #3132's lane (same admission-widening
mechanism, already in flight there) rather than a standalone child issue —
re-measure this residual once #3132 lands before deciding whether a separate
issue is still warranted.

## Validation (applies to every slice)

- Leak probe: affected construct compiles standalone with ZERO family
  `env::` imports AND `WebAssembly.instantiate(binary, {})` succeeds.
- Construct-sampled corpus flip (leaky-pass → host-free pass), never
  directory-sampled (the #2938 lesson).
- `prove-emit-identity`: gc/host lane byte-identical; wasi lane unchanged
  unless the slice targets it.
- Full standalone lane runs ONLY in `merge_group` (standalone-highwater floor
  #2097) — scoped-green is provisional; the floor is the decider.
- Modules without the construct: byte-identical (carrier-gate discipline).

## Acceptance (umbrella closes when)

- `__create_generator`, `__create_async_generator`, `__make_callback`,
  `__get_caught_exception` each appear in <100 official-scope leaky passes
  (from 1,739 / 2,408 / 2,262 / 4,106).
- host_free_pass ≥ 24,500 (from 20,885) — i.e. the family's ~90% banked.
- `registerGeneratorHostImports` (the index.ts:11798 registration) is dead in
  standalone compiles of the test262 corpus (S7 assert).
