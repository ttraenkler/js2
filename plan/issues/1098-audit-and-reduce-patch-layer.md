# #1098 — Audit and reduce patch-layer accumulation in codegen

## Source

External compiler engineer review (2026-04-12): "too many local fixes expressed as comments, special cases, and runtime shims" — identified as a sign of patch-stack entropy that makes future semantics work slower and riskier.

## Problem

The codegen directory has accumulated local workarounds and special-case branches that were added incrementally to fix individual test failures. These are not wrong per se — they fixed real bugs — but over time they form a "patch layer" that:

1. **Obscures the intended algorithm** — hard to tell which code is the mainline path vs. a special case
2. **Creates interaction risks** — special cases can silently conflict when new features touch the same code
3. **Resists refactoring** — each workaround is a hidden dependency; moving code can break edge cases you don't understand

### Current state (verified 2026-04-12)

- **155 workaround/special-case/fallback/edge-case comments** across 25 codegen files
- **273 `as unknown as Instr` type casts** across 26 files (tracked separately in #1095)
- Highest density files:
  - `expressions/calls.ts` — 39 workaround comments
  - `expressions/assignment.ts` — 16
  - `property-access.ts` — 16
  - `type-coercion.ts` — 12
  - `statements/destructuring.ts` — 11

## Goal

Audit the highest-density files, classify each workaround as:

1. **Correct and necessary** — document why, add spec reference, keep
2. **Correct but should be generalized** — the special case is a symptom of a missing general mechanism; refactor into the mainline path
3. **Stale / no longer needed** — the root cause was fixed elsewhere; remove safely
4. **Wrong / masking a real bug** — the workaround hides a deeper issue; file a targeted bug

Then execute categories 2 and 3 for the top 3 files.

## Approach

Start with the top 3 files by density:
1. `expressions/calls.ts` (39 annotations)
2. `expressions/assignment.ts` (16 annotations)
3. `property-access.ts` (16 annotations)

For each file:
- Read every annotated workaround
- Trace the git blame to understand when/why it was added
- Classify per the 4 categories above
- Refactor or remove categories 2 and 3
- Document category 1 with spec references

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Audit document for top 3 files: every workaround classified (1-4)
- [ ] ≥20 stale or generalizable workarounds cleaned up
- [ ] Net LOC reduction in audited files
- [ ] No regressions: equivalence tests pass
- [ ] Each remaining workaround has a comment explaining why it's necessary

## Complexity

M (<400 lines) — the audit is the main effort; most removals/refactors are small
