# #341 -- Property introspection (hasOwnProperty, propertyIsEnumerable)

## Status: open

1,001 tests need property introspection methods. For WasmGC structs, this means compile-time field enumeration and a runtime check against known field names.

## Details

For statically-known struct types, `hasOwnProperty("fieldName")` can be resolved at compile time to `i32.const 0` or `i32.const 1`. For dynamic cases, needs a field-name table per struct type.

`propertyIsEnumerable` follows similar logic but also needs to track property descriptor flags (all struct fields are enumerable by default in our model).

Approach:
1. For compile-time-known property names on known struct types, emit a constant
2. For dynamic property names, emit a lookup against a string table of field names stored per struct type
3. For `in` operator, same mechanism: check field name membership

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `obj.hasOwnProperty("x")` works for struct-backed objects
- [ ] `"x" in obj` works for struct-backed objects
- [ ] `obj.propertyIsEnumerable("x")` works
- [ ] 1,001 previously skipped tests are now attempted
