# #1560 — CJS class re-exports link to compiled class

## Resolution (2026-05-21) — COVERED BY #1559

With the #1559 resolver fix applied (PR #457), the symptom this issue
chased no longer reproduces:

- `import { Linter } from "eslint"` → `r.imports` contains **no**
  `__new_Linter` extern.
- The two-hop, three-hop, and ESLint chains all propagate the class
  binding through `module.exports = { Class }` re-exports correctly.

The CJS re-export plumbing established by #1277 (`module.exports →
Wasm exports`) and #1279 (`require()` graph) was always functional for
class values — the apparent breakage in #1400 was caused entirely by
the resolver picking `eslint/lib/types/index.d.ts` (the `types`
condition of the `exports` map) instead of the impl entry. Once #1559
redirects bare-package imports to the `.js` body, the class binding
flows through every re-export hop intact.

**Smoke result (2026-05-21, worktree `issue-1560-cjs-class-reexport`,
#1559 applied):**

```
Imports with __new_: []
Has __new_Linter: false
Binary bytes: 961400
```

The residual Tier 1b failure (`WebAssembly.validate(r.binary) === false`)
is a separate downstream blocker (#1287 territory), not within the
scope of #1560.

**Regression coverage** added in `tests/issue-1560.test.ts`:

1. Two-hop `leaf → middle → entry` class re-export.
2. Three-hop `leaf → mid1 → mid2 → entry` chain that mirrors
   ESLint's depth without depending on bare-package resolution.

No code change required under #1560 — closing as `covered_by: 1559`.

## Problem

ESLint exposes its `Linter` class through a chain of CommonJS
re-exports:

```js
// eslint/lib/api.js
const { Linter } = require("./linter");
module.exports = { Linter, SourceCode, RuleTester, /* ... */ };
```

```js
// eslint/lib/linter/index.js
const { Linter } = require("./linter");
module.exports = { Linter };
```

```js
// eslint/lib/linter/linter.js
class Linter { /* real implementation */ }
module.exports = { Linter };
```

The CJS lowering established by #1277 (module.exports → Wasm exports)
and #1279 (require() graph) handles function exports correctly. But
**class values** at the `module.exports = { ClassName }` site
currently degrade to an extern constructor in the package-entry path:
the named import `{ Linter }` at the consumer module ends up wired to
`env.__new_Linter` rather than to the compiled class struct/type from
the leaf module.

## Reproducer

After #1559 (resolver picks `./lib/api.js` for the bare-package import):

```ts
import { Linter } from "eslint";
new Linter();
```

`compileProject` succeeds, but `r.imports` includes `__new_Linter`
because the re-export chain
`api.js` → `linter/index.js` → `linter/linter.js` loses the link to
the compiled `Linter` type at one of the `module.exports = { Linter }`
hops.

A reduced repro that mirrors the chain (independent of ESLint):

```js
// pkg/leaf.js
class Foo {
  hello() { return 42; }
}
module.exports = { Foo };
```

```js
// pkg/middle.js
const { Foo } = require("./leaf");
module.exports = { Foo };
```

```ts
// entry.ts
import { Foo } from "./pkg/middle";
new Foo();
```

Expected: `new Foo()` produces a compiled-class struct; no
`__new_Foo` extern in `r.imports`. Current: extern fallback.

## Hypothesis

`src/codegen/index.ts` (or the multi-module pipeline in
`compileMultiSource`) handles named CJS exports at the leaf level —
the class is registered as a compile target. But the re-export hop
(`const { Foo } = require("./leaf")` followed by
`module.exports = { Foo }`) does not propagate the class binding
through the binding-import chain. The consumer module then looks up
`Foo` and finds either no binding (falls back to extern from `.d.ts`)
or finds a "JS value" binding that doesn't carry the class-type info.

`#1284` (class-typed values in index-signature dicts) and `#1308`
(Wasm closure struct returned to JS host) handled adjacent
class-as-value cases. This issue is the **CJS re-export** variant:
the class survives the dict round-trip in-module but not the
`module.exports` round-trip across modules.

## Suggested investigation

1. Add a probe `tests/issue-1560.test.ts` with the minimal
   `leaf` → `middle` → `entry` repro above. Confirm `r.imports`
   contains the extern.
2. Inspect the CJS lowering in `src/codegen/index.ts` (search for
   `module.exports` and the named-binding propagation). The leaf
   module's `class Foo` should register a compile target keyed by
   the export name `Foo`; the middle module's re-export should
   forward that same compile target under its `Foo` name.
3. Compare with the function re-export path which already works
   (the #1276 HOF pattern). What's different about the class case?

## Acceptance criteria

1. The reduced repro (`leaf` → `middle` → `entry` class re-export)
   compiles such that `r.imports` contains no `__new_Foo` extern,
   and `new Foo()` produces a compiled-class struct.
2. After #1559 lands, `compileProject` on the ESLint entry
   produces no `__new_Linter` extern in `r.imports` and `Linter`
   is the compiled class.
3. ESLint Tier 1e unskips and either passes or moves to the
   next-layer blocker.
4. Existing tests pass: lodash Tier 1+2 (function re-exports),
   Hono Tier 5 (class App with method re-exports), the #1284
   class-in-dict regression.
5. A regression test under `tests/issue-1560.test.ts` pins the
   minimal class re-export chain.

## Notes

- This is #1400 item 2 (deferred from S52 partial PR), promoted to
  its own issue.
- Depends on #1559: bare-package resolution must pick the impl
  graph before re-export linkage is testable end-to-end. Until
  #1559 lands, this issue's reduced repro is the actionable
  workload (the ESLint case can be confirmed once #1559 closes).
- Feasibility kept at `medium` (not `hard`) because the underlying
  CJS plumbing already supports function values — extending it to
  class values should be a localized change in the export
  resolution.

## Finding (2026-05-20) — reduced repro PASSES on current main

While building the regression test (`tests/issue-1560.test.ts`), we
discovered that the **local-file** CJS class re-export pattern
(`./pkg/leaf` -> `./pkg/middle` -> `entry.ts`) ALREADY WORKS:

- `compileProject` succeeds.
- `r.imports` contains no `__new_Foo` extern.
- The binary instantiates and `new Foo().hello()` returns 42 end-to-end.

This narrows #1560's scope significantly. The CJS re-export plumbing
established by #1277 and #1279 IS functional for local-file graphs;
class values DO survive the `module.exports = { ClassName }` hop.

The remaining bug surface is **bare-package + package.json resolution
specific**: the failure observed in #1400 (`__new_Linter` extern
appearing in `r.imports`) is most likely caused by #1559 (resolver
returns the `.d.ts` instead of the impl), not by a CJS re-export
linkage gap.

### Revised dispatch plan

1. Land #1559 first (resolver picks impl entry for bare-package codegen).
2. Re-test ESLint Tier 1a with the #1559 fix in place — verify
   `r.imports` no longer contains `__new_Linter`.
3. If `__new_Linter` is gone after #1559, **close #1560 as "covered
   by #1559"**.
4. If `__new_Linter` is still present after #1559, the residual bug
   IS in the bare-package CJS class re-export hop, and #1560 stays
   open with a refined test that exercises a synthetic
   `node_modules/foo/` fixture (not relative paths).

### Status transition recommendation

Flip frontmatter to:
```yaml
status: blocked   # blocked by #1559
depends_on: [1559]
```

Until #1559 lands, this issue cannot be confirmed live. The current
regression test in `tests/issue-1560.test.ts` remains as a positive
guard for local-file CJS class re-exports — that pattern must
continue to work.

## Implementation Plan

### Root cause (revised after 2026-05-20 finding)

The local-file CJS class re-export chain ALREADY WORKS on current
main (`leaf.js → middle.js → entry.ts` with `module.exports =
{ Foo }` at every hop). `tests/issue-1560.test.ts` confirms this
end-to-end: `r.imports` has no `__new_Foo` extern and `new
Foo().hello()` returns 42.

The originally observed symptom (`__new_Linter` in `r.imports`
after `import { Linter } from "eslint"`) is **caused by the #1559
resolver bug**: TypeScript's `ts.resolveModuleName` picks
ESLint's `./lib/types/index.d.ts` (the `types` condition of the
`exports` map) and codegen receives a `.d.ts` file as if it were
the implementation. The `.d.ts` only contains `declare class
Linter`, so codegen falls through to extern. The CJS re-export
plumbing is never exercised in the ESLint path.

### Action — DEFER, GATE ON #1559

This issue is **gated entirely on #1559**. No code change is
proposed under #1560 until we have empirical evidence that
something is still broken after #1559 lands.

### Procedure (executed after #1559 merges)

1. **Confirm #1559 is merged on main** (commit landed,
   `tests/issue-1559.test.ts` green in CI).

2. **Smoke-test ESLint Tier 1a with the resolver fix in place:**
   ```bash
   cd /workspace
   npm test -- tests/stress/eslint-tier1.test.ts
   ```
   If Tier 1a's new assertion (`r.imports` does NOT contain
   `__new_Linter`) is green → the residual bug imagined by #1560
   does not exist. Close #1560 as "covered by #1559" with a
   reference to the merged PR.

3. **If `__new_Linter` is still present after #1559:** the
   residual bug IS in the bare-package CJS class re-export hop.
   Reopen / proceed with the investigation below.

### If reopened — investigation steps

The reduced repro that already passes uses **relative-path**
imports. The failing case (hypothetically) would use
**bare-package + `node_modules`-resolved** paths. Differences to
probe:

1. **Module key normalization.** When resolveAllImports
   (`src/resolve.ts:360`) populates the `Map<string, string>`,
   relative-path repros end up with file paths under the entry's
   directory; `node_modules` paths end up under the package's
   own directory. The `module.exports` lowering keys exports by
   absolute file path. If the consumer's TypeScript-resolved path
   (`.../node_modules/eslint/lib/api.js`) differs from the path
   recorded by `resolveAllImports` (e.g. via symlink resolution
   in `host.realpath`), the binding lookup misses.
   - **Check**: log `allFiles.keys()` and the resolver output for
     `eslint` next to each other and assert path equality
     (compare via `path.resolve` AND `fs.realpathSync`).

2. **CJS rewrite scope.** `rewriteCjsRequire` (line 381 of
   resolve.ts) is applied to ALL files including those under
   `node_modules`. Confirm that `eslint/lib/api.js`'s
   `module.exports = { Linter, ... }` pattern is rewritten the
   same way the reduced repro's `pkg/leaf.js` is rewritten.
   - **Check**: dump `rewriteCjsRequire(fs.readFileSync(
     ".../node_modules/eslint/lib/api.js", "utf-8"))` and diff
     against the test fixture's `module.exports = { Foo }` after
     rewrite.

3. **Multi-hop re-export depth.** ESLint's chain is three hops
   (`api.js` → `linter/index.js` → `linter/linter.js`), the
   reduced repro is two hops (`middle.js` → `leaf.js`). If the
   class identity survives the first hop but not the second, the
   issue is hop-count related.
   - **Check**: extend `tests/issue-1560.test.ts` with a
     three-hop variant (`leaf.js` → `mid1.js` → `mid2.js` →
     `entry.ts`). If this still passes locally but the ESLint
     case fails, the bug is bare-package specific (e.g. a
     `node_modules` path-normalization quirk).

4. **`.d.ts` ambient declaration interference.** Even after
   #1559 redirects codegen to `lib/api.js`, the TypeScript
   checker still sees `lib/types/index.d.ts`. If type info from
   the `.d.ts` shadows the class type from `api.js` in the
   binding table, the class identity is lost during binding
   resolution.
   - **Check**: grep `src/codegen/index.ts` for places where
     binding lookup consults the type-checker's class shape
     versus the runtime export shape. If they disagree, the
     `.d.ts`-derived shape is winning.

### If the bug is real — proposed fix locations

(These are exploratory pointers. Do NOT implement until step 3
above confirms the bug exists.)

- `src/codegen/index.ts` — the module-export propagation logic
  for CJS re-exports. Search for `module.exports`,
  `exportBindings`, or `cjsExports` to find where the binding
  table is populated from `module.exports = { Foo }` patterns.
- `src/cjs-rewrite.ts` — the AST rewrite that turns
  `module.exports = { Foo }` into ESM-equivalent
  `export { Foo }`. Verify that bare-package paths produce
  identical output to relative paths.

### Acceptance criteria (only relevant if reopened)

1. Three-hop class re-export from a `node_modules`-resolved
   bare-package import produces no `__new_Linter` (or
   `__new_Foo` in the synthetic case) in `r.imports`.
2. ESLint Tier 1a `r.imports` has no `__new_Linter`.
3. The existing local-file repro in `tests/issue-1560.test.ts`
   continues to pass.

### Regression gate

Even though no code change is proposed pre-#1559, when this
issue's status is finalized (closed or fixed) run:

```bash
npm test -- tests/issue-1560.test.ts
npm test -- tests/stress/eslint-tier1.test.ts
npm test -- tests/stress/lodash-tier1.test.ts
npm test -- tests/stress/lodash-tier2.test.ts
npm test -- tests/stress/hono-tier5.test.ts   # class App method re-exports
```

### Frontmatter changes

Apply now (independent of #1559 outcome):

```yaml
status: ready → blocked
depends_on: [1559]   # already present, keep
```

Apply after #1559 merges (depending on outcome):

- If ESLint Tier 1a is clean → `status: blocked → done` with
  resolution `covered-by: 1559`.
- If `__new_Linter` still appears → `status: blocked → ready`
  and dispatch a dev to execute the investigation above.
