# #1246 — ci: differential test262 with src-tree-hash caching

## Problem

The current PR regression gate compares branch results against a rolling
`js2wasm-baselines` snapshot. That snapshot is always behind main by up to one
sharded-run duration (~10 min). PRs pushed during that window compare against
stale wasm — tests changed by recently-landed PRs appear as regressions.
The only workaround has been admin-merges plus manual drift analysis (PR#142,
#143, #151, etc.).

## Solution

**Compare branch tip vs. main HEAD directly.** Key main HEAD results by
`git rev-parse origin/main:src` (the src/ directory tree hash). This is
content-addressable: after a normal `--merge` PR merge, the new main commit's
`src/` tree is identical to the branch tip's `src/` tree → same tree hash →
cache hit → no re-run needed on main.

### Flow

```
PR CI starts:
  Job A (always): shard branch tip → 16 workers → merge → branch results
  Job B (conditional):
    1. Compute main_tree = git rev-parse origin/main:src
    2. Try: actions/cache restore key=test262-main-{main_tree}
       HIT  → load cached main results (near-instant)
       MISS → checkout origin/main, shard 16 workers → merge → store cache
  Comparison job (needs A + B):
    diff(branch_results, main_results) → regression gate

After merge to main:
  main HEAD src/ tree hash == branch tip src/ tree hash (same content)
  → cache already populated from branch's Job B (if it ran)
  → next PR's Job B: cache HIT immediately
```

### Why this eliminates drift

The comparison is always branch vs. exact main HEAD at CI time. There is no
stale snapshot. A test that changed due to a previous PR shows as "already
changed on main" — not a regression — because both sides compile from the same
src/ tree.

### Why it doesn't add delay

- Cache hit: Job B completes instantly; total CI time ≈ Job A ≈ 10 min
- Cache miss: Jobs A + B run in parallel; total ≈ max(A, B) ≈ 10 min
- Same wall-clock time as today in both cases

## Implementation plan

### 1. New workflow: `.github/workflows/test262-differential.yml`

Replace (or augment) the existing regression-check path in `test262-sharded.yml`.

**`check-main-cache` job** (runs first, fast):
```yaml
outputs:
  cache_hit: ${{ steps.restore.outputs.cache-hit }}
  main_tree: ${{ steps.tree.outputs.sha }}
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v5
  - id: tree
    run: echo "sha=$(git rev-parse origin/main:src)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  - id: restore
    uses: actions/cache/restore@v4
    with:
      key: test262-main-${{ steps.tree.outputs.sha }}
      path: /tmp/main-results/
      lookup-only: true
```

**`test262-branch` job** (16-shard matrix, always runs):
- Identical to existing shards but checks out the PR branch SHA

**`test262-main` job** (16-shard matrix, conditional):
```yaml
if: needs.check-main-cache.outputs.cache_hit != 'true'
```
- Checks out `origin/main`, runs same shards
- After `merge-main-reports`: saves cache with key `test262-main-{main_tree}`

**`compare` job** (needs branch merge-report + main merge-report/cache-restore):
```yaml
needs: [test262-branch-merge, test262-main-merge-or-cache]
steps:
  - name: Load main results
    # if cache_hit: restore from cache; else: download artifact from test262-main job
  - name: Diff
    run: npx tsx scripts/diff-test262.ts main-results/ branch-results/
  - name: Regression gate
    # same threshold logic as today: net_per_test, bucket checks, etc.
```

### 2. Cache key design

```
test262-main-{git rev-parse origin/main:src}
```

- Scope: per `src/` tree content (not per commit)
- After merge: same tree hash → automatic cache hit for all subsequent PRs
- Eviction: GitHub Actions cache LRU (10 GB repo limit); results are ~2 MB per run, so thousands of entries fit

### 3. Store result format

Reuse the existing `test262-merged-report` artifact format (the JSONL already
produced by `merge-shard-reports`). Cache stores a `.tar.gz` of the merged
JSONL + summary JSON.

### 4. Deprecate js2wasm-baselines comparison

Once this is live and validated over 3+ PRs:
- Remove the `download js2wasm-baselines` step from regression check
- Keep `promote-baseline` to `js2wasm-baselines` for the landing-page dashboard
  (pass-rate history) — just don't use it for the gate

### 5. Keep `refresh-committed-baseline.yml`

The committed JSONL (`benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl`) still serves the
`dev-self-merge` bucket-by-path analysis. Keep refreshing it from the latest
main sharded run artifact. The differential workflow supplements it for PR gating;
it doesn't replace the committed JSONL.

## Acceptance criteria

1. A PR that is up-to-date with main produces zero false regressions even if
   another PR merged to main while its CI was in-flight.
2. CI wall-clock time does not increase vs. baseline (cache hit: ≈ 10 min;
   cache miss: ≈ 10 min, parallelised).
3. Admin merges are no longer needed to work around baseline drift — the gate
   correctly reads zero regressions for any PR that matches main's src/ tree.
4. Three consecutive PRs pass the gate without drift-related false failures.
5. `js2wasm-baselines` snapshot is still updated after each main push (for
   dashboard history), but is no longer the gate comparison source.
