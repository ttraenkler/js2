# #204 — Array literal compile errors

## Status: in-review
## Summary
15 test262 compile errors in `language/expressions/array`. While 6 pass, the remaining errors involve array patterns the compiler can't handle.

## Motivation
15 compile errors in array expressions:
- 14 "Unsupported call expression" — likely Array constructor or method calls
- 1 other error

Array literal creation works for simple cases but fails for:
- Sparse arrays: `[1,,3]`
- Array with spread: `[...arr]`
- Array with complex expressions

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — array literal codegen

## Complexity
M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Sparse array literals compile
- [x] Spread in array literals compiles
- [x] Array() constructor function calls compile (Array(n), Array(a,b,c))
- [ ] 10+ test262 array compile errors fixed (cannot verify - test262 test files not available in worktree)

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
1. **Added `compileArrayConstructorCall` function** in `expressions.ts` to handle `Array()`, `Array(n)`, and `Array(a,b,c)` as function calls (not just `new Array(...)` which was already supported). These have identical semantics to their `new` counterparts in JS.

2. **Updated the `Array` function call handler** to delegate to `compileArrayConstructorCall` instead of falling through to the "Unknown function" error for all cases with arguments.

3. **Added 19 equivalence tests** covering:
   - Array spread at start, end, middle
   - Multiple spreads, empty spreads
   - Spread-only (array copy)
   - Array length after spread
   - String array spread
   - Nested spreads
   - `Array()`, `Array(n)`, `Array(a,b,c)` function calls
   - `new Array(n)`, `new Array(a,b,c)` constructor calls

### What worked
- Sparse arrays and spread in array literals were already implemented correctly
- The main gap was `Array()` as a function call (vs `new Array()`)
- The `compileArrayConstructorCall` function cleanly handles all three cases with proper element type inference from contextual types

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — added `compileArrayConstructorCall`, updated `Array` call handling
- `tests/equivalence/sparse-array-spread.test.ts` — new test file with 19 tests

### Tests now passing
- 19 new equivalence tests (all pass)
- 0 regressions (all 513 existing passing tests still pass)
