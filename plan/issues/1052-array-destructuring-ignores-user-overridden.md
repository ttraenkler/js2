# #1052 — Array destructuring ignores user-overridden Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]

## Problem

Tests override `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` and expect array destructuring to invoke the user-installed iterator. Our dstr lowering always calls the built-in array iterator directly, ignoring prototype overrides.

## Evidence from harvest

- **Test count:** 80 tests currently failing with this pattern
- **Top path buckets:**
  - `24 test/language/expressions/class/dstr/*`
  - `24 test/language/statements/class/dstr/*`
  - `6 test/language/expressions/object/dstr/*`
- **Top error messages:**
  - 12× `TypeError (null/undefined access): Array destructuring uses overriden Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]`
- **Sample test files:**
  - `test/language/expressions/arrow-function/dstr/dflt-ary-ptrn-elem-id-iter-val-array-prototype.js`
  - `test/language/expressions/async-generator/dstr/named-dflt-ary-ptrn-elem-id-iter-val-array-prototype.js`
  - `test/language/expressions/class/dstr/private-gen-meth-static-ary-ptrn-elem-id-iter-val-array-prototype.js`

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§7.4.3 GetIterator](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-getiterator) — step 1a: calls GetMethod(obj, @@iterator) to obtain the iterator
- [§13.15.5.3 Runtime Semantics: DestructuringAssignmentEvaluation](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-destructuringassignmentevaluation) — ArrayAssignmentPattern: step 1 calls GetIterator(value)


## Root cause hypothesis

Array-pattern dstr is compiled as a direct index-loop over the underlying array struct (fast path) and never checks whether `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` has been replaced. The spec requires `GetIterator(value)` which goes through the prototype chain.

## Fix

When the dstr source type is `any`/externref or when we cannot prove `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` has not been replaced, fall back to the generic iterator protocol. Alternatively, gate the fast path on a single dirty flag tracking replacement of built-in iterator methods.

## Expected impact

~80 FAIL.

## Key files

- src/codegen/expressions.ts (array-pattern dstr fast path)

## Source

Filed by `harvester-post-sprint-40-merge` 2026-04-11 against the post-merge Sprint 40 main baseline (`benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl`, 43,164 records).

## Investigation 2026-04-11 (dev-1056)

The feasibility estimate is too optimistic. The root cause is deeper than the
destructuring fast path: **the TS assignment `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = <generator>`
compiles successfully but does not actually install anything on JS Array.prototype**. Verified
with a probe: after running compiled wasm, `[1,2,3][Symbol.iterator]().next()` in JS still
returns the original iterator (`{value: 1, done: false}`).

That means a fix based on "route destructuring through JS `Array.from(x)` so the override
triggers" cannot work — the override never reaches JS-land. Any real fix must either:

1. **Install a JS trampoline for Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator] assignments** — emit a
   host import `__install_array_iterator(closureStruct)` that registers a JS shim that, on
   each `next()`, calls back into wasm to advance the user's generator and marshal yielded
   values. Requires exposing our wasm generator ABI (`next`/`return`/`throw`) to JS via an
   exported trampoline, plus boxing/unboxing each yielded value. Substantial.

2. **Track the override in wasm-land and intercept array destructuring natively** — scan for
   the assignment at compile time, record the generator function index, then in
   `compileArrayDestructuring` emit a call to the generator with `this = source array` and
   consume via the wasm iterator protocol. Still non-trivial: the generator closure must be
   addressable, and object-literal iteration (for-of, spread, `...rest`) would need the same
   treatment to stay consistent.

### Prototype attempted and reverted

Tried routing the vec-array fast path through an externref fallback + a new
`__array_iter_collect` host helper that does `Array.from(convertToJS(val))`. The helper
correctly materialised the source vec as a JS array (after adding `__array_iter_collect`
to the `emitVecAccessExports` trigger list so `__vec_len`/`__vec_get` exports were emitted,
and forcing `_arrayLiteralForceVec = true` when the iterator dirty flag is set so `[1,2,3]`
compiles to a vec, not a tuple struct). Then `Array.from(src)` was called — but it hit
the *unmodified* `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]`, so destructuring returned `[1,2,3]`
instead of the expected `[1,2,42]`. This confirms that *no viable iterator-collect helper
can work in JS-space* until the prototype assignment actually lands on JS Array.prototype.

### Reproduction (module-level)

```typescript
Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function* () {
  if (this.length > 0) yield this[0];
  if (this.length > 1) yield this[1];
  if (this.length > 2) yield 42;
};
var [x, y, z] = [1, 2, 3];
// Expected: x=1, y=2, z=42 (override yields 42 for third element)
// Actual:   x=1, y=2, z=3  (override is a no-op; built-in iterator used)
```

### Recommendation

Reclassify as `feasibility: hard`, block on issue "expose wasm generator ABI to JS
trampoline" (not yet filed). Do NOT scope into a single dev task until the prototype-
write-to-host mechanism exists. The 80-test bucket stays failing until then.
