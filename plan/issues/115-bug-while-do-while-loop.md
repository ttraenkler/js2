# Issue 115: Bug — while/do-while loop internal variable scope crash

## Summary

The compiler emits internal variable names like `__in__do__before__break` for
loop control flow, but these variables are not being declared in scope before use,
causing TypeScript to report:

```
Variable '__in__do__before__break' is used before being assigned.
Unknown identifier: __in__do__before__break
```

This causes ~3 test failures in `language/statements/while`.

## Example test

- `test/language/statements/while/S12.6.2_A4_T2.js`

Full error:
```
Variable '__in__do__before__break' is used before being assigned.;
Variable '__in__do__IN__before__break' is used before being assigned.;
Variable '__in__do__IN__after__break' is used before being assigned.;
Variable '__in__do__after__break' is used before being assigned.;
Unknown identifier: __in__do__before__break
```

## Root cause

The compiler synthesizes internal control flow variables for break/continue
handling inside `do-while` loops with `in` expressions in the condition. These
synthetic variable names are referenced before they are declared, or their
declaration is being emitted in the wrong scope.

The pattern `__in__do__IN__before__break` / `__in__do__before__break` suggests
a desugaring of `for (x in obj) { ... }` inside a `do-while` (or a `while`
containing a `for-in`), where internal state variables track break/continue flow.

## Approach

1. Find where `__in__do__before__break` is generated in the compiler
2. Ensure all synthetic internal variables are declared (hoisted) at the top of
   the enclosing function body before first use
3. Or: refactor the control flow desugaring to not require pre-declared variables
   (use a fresh local variable per loop)
