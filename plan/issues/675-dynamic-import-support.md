# #675 — Dynamic import() support

## Status: in-review
~471 tests use `import()`.

### Approach
1. **Static dynamic import**: `import("./module.js")` where the path is a string literal — resolve at compile time, inline the module
2. **Host-delegated import**: For variable paths, emit a host import `__dynamic_import(path) -> Promise<externref>` that the JS host resolves
3. **import.meta**: Already partially supported (#371). Extend with `import.meta.url` and `import.meta.resolve`

Since we compile single modules, static imports can be resolved during compilation. Dynamic runtime imports need host assistance.

## Implementation Notes

### What was done
- Fixed a gap where the second argument to `import()` (import attributes/options) was silently ignored
- Per ES spec, the second argument must be evaluated for side effects before the host import
- If the options expression throws, the throw propagates synchronously (before the promise is created)
- Added evaluation + drop for all extra arguments beyond the specifier

### What was NOT done (and why)
- **Multi-module resolution**: ~561 of the 471+ test262 failures require loading FIXTURE files (other modules). This is fundamentally impossible in a single-module compiler -- these tests need a module loader/linker.
- **Static dynamic import inlining**: Resolving `import("./module.js")` at compile time would require the compiler to locate and inline other source files. This is a much larger feature (bundler-like functionality).
- **Standalone fallback**: The current `__dynamic_import` host import traps in standalone mode. A true standalone fallback would need a module registry, which is out of scope for this issue.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: Evaluate all import() arguments for side effects (not just the first)
- `tests/issue-675.test.ts`: New test file with 7 tests

## Complexity: M
