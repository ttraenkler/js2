# Issue 81: npm package resolution and tree-shaking

## Current status

**Partially implemented.** Most infrastructure already exists. See Investigation
Findings below for details on what works, what is broken, and what remains.

Phase 1 (basic resolution of .ts packages) could proceed since it only needs
`ts.resolveModuleName`, but most npm packages ship as JS, requiring #80.
Tree-shaking (Phase 2) requires call graph analysis which is a significant
new subsystem.

## Investigation Findings (2026-03-18)

### What already exists

The following APIs and infrastructure are fully implemented:

1. **`compileMulti(files, entryFile, options)`** (`src/index.ts` line 140)
   - In-memory multi-file compilation via `Record<string, string>` file map
   - Cross-file imports with relative paths (`./foo`, `../bar`) work correctly
   - Import chains (A -> B -> C), re-exports, multiple exports all work
   - Only entry file exports become Wasm exports (non-entry exports are internal)
   - Tested and verified: 3-level chains, re-exports, multiple named imports

2. **`compileProject(entryFile, options)`** (`src/index.ts` line 174)
   - Disk-based compilation that reads files from the filesystem
   - Uses `ModuleResolver` + `resolveAllImports` to walk the import graph
   - Converts resolved files to `Record<string, string>` and delegates to `compileMultiSource`

3. **`ModuleResolver`** (`src/resolve.ts`)
   - Uses `ts.resolveModuleName()` for both relative and bare specifiers
   - Supports `externals` option to skip packages
   - Supports `resolve.modules` and `resolve.extensions` options
   - Loads `tsconfig.json` paths/baseUrl when available
   - Has resolution caching

4. **`resolveAllImports(entryFile, resolver)`** (`src/resolve.ts` line 201)
   - Recursively walks imports (including `export ... from "..."`)
   - Returns `Map<string, string>` of all resolved files

5. **`preprocessImports(source)`** (`src/import-resolver.ts`)
   - Replaces import statements with `declare` stubs for single-file compilation
   - Handles namespace imports, default imports, named imports
   - Analyzes usage to generate appropriate class/function/const declarations

6. **`treeshake(entryExports, sourceFiles, checker)`** (`src/treeshake.ts`)
   - Cross-file reachability analysis from entry exports
   - Follows symbol aliases (import bindings)
   - Conservatively keeps side-effect statements
   - Tested: correctly marks used/unused declarations across files

7. **`analyzeMultiSource(files, entryFile)`** (`src/checker/index.ts` line 155)
   - Creates in-memory TS program with virtual CompilerHost
   - Has `resolveModuleNameLiterals` for relative path resolution
   - Returns `MultiTypedAST` with checker, program, sourceFiles, entryFile

8. **Test fixtures** (`tests/fixtures/npm-resolve/`)
   - Mock `node_modules/simple-math/` and `node_modules/@scope/utils/` packages
   - Entry file with both bare specifier and relative imports

9. **Existing tests**
   - `tests/multi-file.test.ts` — 9 tests covering basic multi-file scenarios
   - `tests/resolve.test.ts` — unit tests for `getBarePackageName`, `ModuleResolver`,
     `resolveAllImports`, tree-shaking, and integration

### What is broken

1. **Bare specifier resolution gap in `analyzeMultiSource`**
   The `resolveModuleNameLiterals` in `src/checker/index.ts` only handles
   relative paths (`./foo`, `../bar`). For bare specifiers like `"simple-math"`,
   it calls `normalizeFileName("simple-math")` which produces `simple-math.ts`.
   This never matches any key in `normalizedFiles` because `compileProject`
   maps the resolved file as `./node_modules/simple-math/index.ts`.

   The `ModuleResolver` correctly resolves `"simple-math"` to the disk path,
   and `resolveAllImports` correctly includes the file content. But the
   internal TS compiler host in `analyzeMultiSource` cannot map the bare
   specifier back to the correct virtual file key. This means:
   - The file IS included in the compilation
   - But TS reports `Cannot find module 'simple-math'`
   - Type checking fails for the import (symbols are undefined)
   - The compilation still "succeeds" (success=true) but with errors

   **Fix needed**: `analyzeMultiSource` (or `compileMultiSource`) needs a
   specifier-to-file mapping so that `resolveModuleNameLiterals` can resolve
   bare specifiers to the correct virtual file path.

2. **Multi-file test failures (instantiation, not compilation)**
   All 9 tests in `tests/multi-file.test.ts` fail with:
   `TypeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Import #0 "string_constants": module is not an object or function`
   The tests provide only `env` imports but compiled Wasm now also requires
   `string_constants` imports. The test helper `compileAndRunMulti` needs to
   use `buildImports(result.stringPool)` instead of hand-crafted imports.
   This is a test fixture issue, not a compilation bug.

3. **`success: true` despite errors**
   `compileMultiSource` returns `success: true` even when there are semantic
   errors (like unresolved bare specifiers). Only syntax errors cause
   `success: false`. This is potentially confusing.

### What was fixed (2026-03-18)

- **Bare specifier resolution** — Fixed in commit `5389bc2b` (#81). Added auto-derived specifier mapping in `analyzeMultiSource` with 3 strategies: full path, basename, and directory index. Tests in `tests/bare-specifier.test.ts` (5/5 pass).

### What remains to implement

- **Tree-shaking integration**: `treeshake()` exists but is not wired into
  `compileMultiSource`. The `treeshake` option in `CompileOptions` is defined
  but unused.
- **Multi-file test fixture fix**: Tests need `buildImports(result.stringPool)` instead of hand-crafted imports.
- **Phase 3+**: JS packages, CommonJS, tsconfig integration -- all depend on
  other issues (#79, #80).

### Verified working scenarios (manual testing)

```
compileMulti — two files, simple import:           add(1,2) = 3
compileMulti — three-level chain:                  square(5) = 25
compileMulti — re-exports through barrel:          greet() = 42
compileMulti — multiple named exports:             add(10, sub(5,2)) = 13
compileMulti — only entry file exports:            exports = ["test"]
compileProject — disk-based relative imports:      add(mul(3,4), 5) = 17
compileProject — bare specifier (npm):             resolves file but TS errors on import
```

## Summary

Add `node_modules` resolution so that `import { foo } from "some-package"` in
compiled TypeScript resolves and compiles the dependency. Include tree-shaking
to only emit wasm for functions actually used.

## Motivation

Currently, multi-file compilation (#28) requires explicit file paths. Users
can't `import` from npm packages — the compiler doesn't know how to find them
in `node_modules`. This is the infrastructure gap between "compile my files"
and "compile my project."

## Design

### Module resolution

Follow Node's resolution algorithm:

1. Check `node_modules/<pkg>/package.json`
2. Read `exports`, `main`, or `types` field
3. For TypeScript packages: use `.ts` source directly
4. For JS packages: use `.js` + `.d.ts` (requires #80)
5. For `@types/` packages: find `@types/<pkg>/index.d.ts`

```typescript
compile({
  entry: "src/app.ts",
  resolve: {
    modules: ["node_modules"],   // where to look
    extensions: [".ts", ".js"],  // file extensions to try
  },
});
```

The TypeScript compiler API already implements module resolution via
`ts.resolveModuleName`. We should use it rather than reimplementing.

### Resolution modes

| Package type | Source | Types | Approach |
|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TS package (ships `.ts`) | `.ts` files | Inline | Compile directly |
| Typed JS (ships `.js` + `.d.ts`) | `.js` files | `.d.ts` | Requires #80 |
| DefinitelyTyped (`@types/`) | `.js` files | `@types/` `.d.ts` | Requires #80 |
| Untyped JS | `.js` files | TS inference | Requires #79 + #80 |
| Host-only (DOM, Node APIs) | None (host) | `.d.ts` | Declare as host imports |

### Tree-shaking

Without tree-shaking, importing one function from `lodash` would try to compile
the entire library. Tree-shaking is essential for npm support.

1. Start from the entry point's exports
2. Walk the call graph, marking reachable functions/classes/variables
3. Only emit wasm for marked declarations
4. Dead code from dependencies is never compiled (avoiding unsupported features
   in unused code paths)

This also benefits non-npm usage — smaller binaries for large projects.

### Dependency graph

```
src/app.ts
  └── import { debounce } from "lodash-es"
        └── node_modules/lodash-es/debounce.js + @types/lodash-es/debounce.d.ts
              └── import isObject from "./isObject.js"
                    └── node_modules/lodash-es/isObject.js
```

The compiler builds this graph, compiles only reachable modules, and emits
a single wasm binary.

### CommonJS support

Many npm packages use CommonJS (`require`, `module.exports`). TypeScript
handles this with `esModuleInterop`. We need to:

1. Parse `require()` calls as imports
2. Map `module.exports = { ... }` to named exports
3. Handle `exports.foo = ...` as named exports

TS's compiler API already transforms CJS to ESM-like AST with
`esModuleInterop: true`. We can leverage this.

### Host-provided packages

Some packages should NOT be compiled to wasm — they should remain as host
imports (e.g., `fs`, `path`, `http`, DOM APIs). A configuration option:

```typescript
compile({
  entry: "src/app.ts",
  externals: ["fs", "path", "http"],  // keep as host imports
});
```

External packages generate import declarations instead of compiled code.

### tsconfig.json integration

Read `compilerOptions.paths`, `baseUrl`, and `moduleResolution` from
`tsconfig.json` to match the user's existing configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "paths": { "@app/*": ["src/*"] }
  }
}
```

## Implementation phases

1. **Phase 1: Basic resolution** — Resolve bare specifiers to `node_modules`,
   find `.ts` files, compile them. No tree-shaking yet.

2. **Phase 2: Tree-shaking** — Call graph analysis, dead code elimination.
   Only emit reachable code.

3. **Phase 3: JS + .d.ts resolution** — Resolve `.js` packages with type
   declarations. Depends on #80.

4. **Phase 4: CommonJS** — Handle `require`/`module.exports`. Depends on
   TS's `esModuleInterop`.

5. **Phase 5: tsconfig.json** — Read paths, baseUrl, moduleResolution from
   project config.

## Complexity

L — Module resolution is well-defined (reuse TS's implementation), but
tree-shaking requires call graph analysis across modules. CommonJS support
adds edge cases. ~500 lines for phases 1-2, more for the rest.

## Dependencies

| Issue | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **#28** | Multi-file modules — foundation for multi-module compilation |
| **#80** | JS file compilation — needed for JS packages |
| **#79** | Gradual typing — handles untyped imports |
| **#77** | Object literals — npm code uses object literals pervasively |
| **#78** | Standard library — npm code uses builtins freely |
