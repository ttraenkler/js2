# Issue #315: Wasm validation error audit -- systematic fix for type mismatches

## Status: done

## Summary
~93 tests fail with WebAssembly.instantiate validation errors (52 call type + 41 local.set type). These represent codegen bugs where the emitted Wasm is structurally invalid. A systematic audit of type consistency across the codegen can catch these before Wasm instantiation.

## Category
Sprint 5 / Group C

## Complexity: M

## Scope
- Build a pre-validation pass that checks type consistency of emitted instructions
- Log warnings for type mismatches before binary emission
- Fix the most common type mismatch patterns
- Coordinate with #272 and #277 for specific fixes

## Acceptance criteria
- Type mismatch patterns are identified and categorized
- Pre-validation pass catches common errors
- At least 20 validation errors resolved
