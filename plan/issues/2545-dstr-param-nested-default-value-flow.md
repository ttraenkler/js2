# #2545 — nested destructuring-param default: value flow lost when the outer default fires

## Problem

After #2544 clears the invalid-Wasm CE, the `meth-…-dflt-obj-ptrn-prop-obj`
test262 family runs but FAILS its value assertions. When the OUTER parameter
default object fires (the method is called with no argument), the destructured
bindings read `0`/`undefined` instead of the default object's field values.

```ts
class C {
  method({ w: { x, y, z } = { x: 4, y: 5, z: 6 } } = { w: { x: 1, y: 2, z: 6 } }) {
    return z;   // expect 6; wasm returns 0
  }
}
new C().method();   // expected z = 6, got 0
```

Reproduced even for a FULL inner default object (all three fields present, in
declared order) — so it is NOT the #2544 field-pad arity hazard and NOT a
partial-literal/slot-order issue. The whole nested-pattern destructuring of the
outer-default object value yields sentinels.

Contrast: the `…-value-undef` variant (`{ w: undefined }` → the INNER pattern
default `{x:4,y:5,z:6}` fires) returns correct values on main — that is a
different code path. The broken path is specifically destructuring the
OUTER-default object's nested object property into the inner pattern.

## Acceptance criteria

- `new C().method()` with the outer object default firing yields the default
  object's field values (not 0/undefined).
- The `meth-…-dflt-obj-ptrn-prop-obj` test262 family passes its `assert.sameValue`
  checks (x/y/z + the `w` ReferenceError-after-block).
- No regression in the `…-value-undef` / `…-value-null` variants that already
  pass.

## Notes

Deeper than #2544 — touches the value-flow of how a destructuring-param outer
default object is destructured by a nested object pattern. Tracked separately so
#2544 can land the contained invalid-Wasm fix first. Senior-dev / focused fix.

## Resolution (sd-1, 2026-06-21) — already fixed by #2544; regression-guarded

**Verified already fixed on current main (`62baf23aa`).** #2544's landed fix
resolved both the arity invalid-Wasm CE *and* the nested-default value flow
together — the destructuring of the outer-default object's nested object
property no longer yields sentinels.

Evidence (real `runTest262File`, per file):
- The full sync `meth-dflt-obj-ptrn-prop-obj` test262 family (`meth`,
  `meth-static`, `gen-meth`, `private-(gen-)meth(-static)`, base + `-init` +
  `-value-null` + `-value-undef`, in BOTH `language/statements/class/dstr` and
  `language/expressions/class/dstr`) = **48/48 pass**, 0 fail.
- The issue's exact repro (`method({ w: { x, y, z } = {...} } = { w: {...} })`
  with the outer default firing) returns the correct field values (`z === 6`,
  `x === 1`).
- Remaining fails in the broader family are **async-gen** `-value-null` /
  `-value-undef` variants only — the async-generator state-machine path,
  out of scope (deferred, same gap as #2202).

To prevent silent regression of the value flow (the issue's acceptance
criteria), added `tests/issue-2545-nested-dstr-param-default.test.ts`:
outer-default-fires value read (x/y/z), the inner-pattern-default path
(`{ w: undefined }` → inner `{x:4,y:5,z:6}`), and a `w`-out-of-scope guard —
host + standalone. No source change needed; this is a verification +
regression-guard close.
