# Issue 120: undefined/void 0 comparison support

## Summary

129 test262 tests compare values with `undefined` or `void 0`. Currently skipped
because wasm has no undefined type — our values are always typed.

## Problem

Tests like `assert.sameValue(arr[10], undefined)` check out-of-bounds access.
In wasm, array access either traps or returns a typed default (0, null).

## Approach

1. For tests that check `=== undefined`: map to checking against a sentinel
2. For `void 0` expressions: compile as the default value of the expected type
3. Relax the skip filter to only skip truly problematic patterns

## Impact on Array tests

36 tests in `Array.prototype.slice` alone are blocked by this.

## Complexity

M — Needs careful handling of undefined semantics in a typed wasm world.
