# #651 — Empty skip reason for 932 tests

## Status: open

932 tests are skipped with no reason string. This is a bug in the skip logic — tests should always have a reason.

### Fix
Search shouldSkip() for codepaths that return skip:true without setting a reason. Add reasons to all of them.

## Complexity: XS
