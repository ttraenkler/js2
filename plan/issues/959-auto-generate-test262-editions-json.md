# #959 — Auto-generate test262-editions.json from runner results

## Problem

`public/benchmarks/results/test262-editions.json` is a static hand-crafted file that is not updated by the test262 runner. It becomes stale after every run. The edition totals (48,088) don't match the runner results (43,120) because they were computed differently.

## What to build

A script that generates `public/benchmarks/results/test262-editions.json` from actual test262 results after each run.

### Edition detection strategy

Test262 files use YAML frontmatter with these fields:
- `es5id:` → **ES5** (8,115 tests)
- `es6id:` → **ES2015** (3,024 tests)
- `esid:` → spec section reference, needs mapping (37,504 tests)
- `features:` → feature tags that map to editions (most reliable for ES2016+)
- ~2,481 tests have none of the above → use directory path heuristics

Feature-to-edition mapping needed (~50 feature tags):
- ES2016: `Array.prototype.includes`, `exponentiation`
- ES2017: `async-functions`, `Object.entries`, `Object.values`, `SharedArrayBuffer`
- ES2018: `async-iteration`, `regexp-dotall`, `regexp-lookbehind`, `object-rest`, `object-spread`
- ES2019: `Array.prototype.flat`, `Object.fromEntries`, `optional-catch-binding`, `Symbol.prototype.description`
- ES2020: `BigInt`, `Promise.allSettled`, `globalThis`, `optional-chaining`, `nullish-coalescing`, `String.prototype.matchAll`
- ES2021: `Promise.any`, `String.prototype.replaceAll`, `logical-assignment-operators`, `numeric-separator-literal`
- ES2022: `class-fields-public`, `class-fields-private`, `class-static-block`, `top-level-await`, `Array.prototype.at`, `Object.hasOwn`, `error-cause`
- ES2023: `array-find-from-last`, `change-array-by-copy`, `hashbang`
- ES2024: `Array.fromAsync`, `resizable-arraybuffer`, `ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer`, `regexp-v-flag`
- ES2025: `set-methods`, `iterator-helpers`, `regexp-duplicate-named-groups`, `Promise.withResolvers`, `Atomics.waitAsync`

### Output

Write to `public/benchmarks/results/test262-editions.json` with the same schema:
```json
[{ "edition": "ES5", "pass": N, "fail": N, "ce": N, "skip": N, "total": N, "pct": N }, ...]
```

### Integration

- Run as a post-processing step after `pnpm run test:262`
- Or as a standalone script: `pnpm run generate:editions`
- Reads `benchmarks/results/test262-results.jsonl` for pass/fail/ce/skip per test
- Reads test262 YAML frontmatter for edition classification
- Tests with no edition marker → "Other" or "ES3" bucket

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Edition totals match runner results (no gap)
- [ ] Runs after each test262 run (integrated or manual)
- [ ] Writes to `public/benchmarks/results/test262-editions.json`
- [ ] Feature-to-edition mapping covers 95%+ of tests
- [ ] Remaining unclassified tests in an explicit "Other" bucket

## Suspended Work

- **Worktree**: /workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-959
- **Branch**: issue-959-generate-editions
- **Done**: Implementation complete (`scripts/generate-editions.ts`, `package.json` scripts entry, `public/benchmarks/results/test262-editions.json` regenerated). 99.4% classified (47,888/48,174), exceeds 95% criterion. Branch merged with main at commit `6eaa8437`. Signaled to tech lead for merge.
- **Remaining**: Awaiting tech lead merge confirmation only.
- **Resume**: Branch is ready. Just re-signal tech lead: "Branch `issue-959-generate-editions`, commit `6eaa8437`, worktree `/workspace/.claire/worktrees/issue-959` ready for merge."
