# #137 — Object literal getter/setter

## Problem
Object literals with `get`/`set` syntax (`{ get x() { return 1; } }`) are not supported. Only class-based getters/setters work.

## Scope
- `{ get prop() { ... }, set prop(v) { ... } }`
- Object literal methods: `{ method() { ... } }`
- Computed property getters/setters

## Implementation
- During struct type creation for object literals, detect getter/setter declarations
- Compile getter/setter as separate functions (like class accessors)
- Wire up property access/assignment to call getter/setter functions
- Object literal methods already partially work via closures; ensure they work for all cases
