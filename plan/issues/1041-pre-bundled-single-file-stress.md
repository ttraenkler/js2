# #1041 — Closed (framing error)

## Why closed

Filed on the incorrect premise that the compiler has no module graph resolver and all stress tests need an `esbuild` pre-bundle scaffold. That premise is wrong:

- **`compileProject(entryFile, options)`** (`src/index.ts:216`) already walks the transitive import graph via **`resolveAllImports`** (`src/resolve.ts:204`) and compiles every file through **one shared `ts.Program`** via **`compileMultiSource`** (`src/compiler.ts:406`).
- **`ModuleResolver`** (`src/resolve.ts:27`) delegates to `ts.resolveModuleName` with a Node-fs-backed `ts.ModuleResolutionHost`, honoring `moduleResolution: Node10`, `baseUrl`, `rootDir`, `tsconfig.json` `paths`, `externals`, and `resolve.modules` (default `node_modules`). Bare (`lodash`), scoped (`@scope/pkg/sub`), and relative (`./utils`) specifiers all resolve correctly.
- **`preprocessImports`** is a single-file fallback for the `compile()` entry point only. The multi-file path via `compileProject` / `compileMulti` / `compileMultiSource` does NOT use it.
- **Existing tests**: `tests/resolve.test.ts`, `tests/multi-file.test.ts`, `tests/equivalence/multi-file-compilation.test.ts` all exercise real cross-file imports.
- **Existing use**: `playground/main.ts:1879` uses `compileMulti` to wire the benchmark helper module to the editor source at runtime.

The stress tests can run today by pointing `compileProject` at the library's entry file. No `esbuild` pre-bundle scaffold is needed.

## What the user actually asked for

> "each .js ES module to be compiled separately but optionally support specializing the imports and export types based on the actual usage in the consumer module importing it."

This is **separate compilation with consumer-driven type specialization** — per-module Wasm artifacts with a specialization protocol where the consumer's usage pins concrete types at import sites. Conceptually like Rust generic monomorphization or C++ template instantiation. Distinct from whole-program compilation (`compileProject`) and filed as the fresh research issue **#1046**.

## Follow-up

- **#1046** — Separate ES-module compilation with consumer-driven import/export type specialization (research, Backlog)
- **#1031** / **#1034** unblocked immediately via `compileProject`
- **#1044** (Node host imports) and **#1045** (DOM host imports) remain legitimate preconditions for #1032 Tier 4 and #1033 Tier 4
