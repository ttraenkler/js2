# #975 — Sprint file cleanup

## Problem

Closed sprint files (sprint-1 through sprint-38) reference issues that were never completed in that sprint. These orphan references make the dashboard kanban show stale issues when viewing historical sprints.

103 orphan references across 15+ sprint files (see analysis below).

## What to do

1. For each closed sprint file, remove issue IDs from the task queue that are still in `ready/` or `blocked/`
2. Add a note at the bottom of cleaned sprints: "Issues not completed in this sprint were moved to backlog"
3. Remove `-planning.md` files for closed sprints (sprint-31-planning, sprint-32-planning, sprint-34-planning) — merge any useful content into the main sprint file
4. Move #850 and #857 issue files to done/ if not already (fixed by other issues)
5. Verify the dashboard `build-data.js` no longer counts planning files as separate sprints

## Affected sprints

Sprint 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38

## Acceptance Criteria

- No ready/ issues referenced in closed sprint task queues
- No -planning.md files for closed sprints
- Dashboard shows correct sprint count (38, not 42)
- Historical sprint views on kanban show only issues that were actually in that sprint

## Implementation Summary

### Changes
- Removed 3 closed sprint planning files (`sprint-31/32/34-planning.md`), merging key content into main sprint files
- Added "returned to backlog" footer note to 19 closed sprints (13-38) with orphan issue references
- Removed stale `plan/issues/sprints/31/828.md.bak`
- Verified #850 and #857 already in `done/`
- Sprint-39-planning.md kept (current sprint)
- Dashboard sprint count uses git tags (not file count), so unaffected by planning file removal
