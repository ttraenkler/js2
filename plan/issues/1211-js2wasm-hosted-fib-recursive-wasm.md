# #1211 — js2wasm hosted mode: fib-recursive produces invalid Wasm (call param type mismatch)

## Problem

The `fib-recursive` benchmark fails compilation in the `js2wasm -> Node.js (hosted)` lane:

```
| js2wasm -> Node.js (hosted) | | | | compile-error: [wasm-validator error in function fib] call param types must match, on  |
```

The `js2wasm -> Wasmtime` lane for fib-recursive succeeds, so this is specific to
hosted mode (where the compiler uses `externref`-based JS host imports instead of
native Wasm types).

The `fib-recursive` benchmark source:
```javascript
export function run(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return run(n - 1) + run(n - 2);
}
```

## Likely cause

In hosted mode, `n` and the return value are typed as `externref` (boxed numbers)
rather than `f64`. When compiling the recursive call `run(n - 1)`, the compiler
computes `n - 1` producing an `f64` (or i32 in fast mode), then passes it to `run`
whose Wasm signature expects `externref`. The Wasm validator sees the type mismatch
and rejects the module.

The fix requires coercing `n - 1` to `externref` (via `__box_number`) before the
recursive call, or adjusting the function signature to take and return `f64` rather
than `externref` in hosted mode.

## Investigation steps

1. Compile `fib-recursive` in hosted mode and inspect the Wasm output:
   ```bash
   echo 'export function run(n) { if (n<=1) return n; return run(n-1)+run(n-2); }' > /tmp/fib.js
   node scripts/compile.mjs /tmp/fib.js /tmp/fib.wasm 2>&1
   wasm-objdump -d /tmp/fib.wasm | grep -A 20 "fib\|call"
   ```
2. Confirm the call site passes an `f64` where `externref` is expected (or vice versa)
3. Check whether the same issue exists for mutual recursion or calls through closures

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `fib-recursive` compiles without Wasm validation errors in hosted mode
- [x] The computed result matches Node.js baseline (`run(25) === 75025`)
- [x] No regression in equivalence tests (focused i32-fast-path suites all pass)
- [x] `js2wasm -> Node.js (hosted)` lane for `fib-recursive` shows timing numbers
  in the competitive benchmark (separately tracked under #1209)

## Root cause

There were two compounding bugs in the fast-mode codegen for an
`any`-typed recursive function whose body contains
`fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)`:

### Bug A — `compileBooleanBinaryOp` silently swallows arithmetic ops

`compileBinaryExpression` in `src/codegen/binary-ops.ts` dispatches to
`compileBooleanBinaryOp` whenever `(isBooleanType(leftTsType) ||
leftType.kind === "i32") && both operand types not externref`. That
helper only handles comparison/equality operators; the `default:` arm
returns `{ kind: "i32" }` without emitting any combining instruction.

For `fib(n - 1)` with `n` typed as `any` and the binary op `MinusToken`,
the i32-arithmetic path at line 1202 doesn't fire (its guard requires
`isNumberType(leftTsType)` which is false for `any`). The dispatch
falls into `compileBooleanBinaryOp(MinusToken)` → default arm → no
`i32.sub` emitted. Net effect: `n - 1` compiles to "push `n`; push 1"
with no subtraction; the call to `fib` consumes the literal `1` and
leaves `n` orphaned on the stack. The recursion silently degenerates to
`fib(1)` for every n > 1.

### Bug B — `compileAnyBinaryDispatch` doesn't box operands

`compileAnyBinaryDispatch` calls helpers like `__any_add(ref $AnyValue,
ref $AnyValue)`, but its operand-compilation path was:

```ts
const leftType = compileExpression(ctx, fctx, expr.left);
const rightType = compileExpression(ctx, fctx, expr.right);
fctx.body.push({ op: "call", funcIdx });
```

It assumed `compileExpression` would naturally produce a `ref $AnyValue`,
but in fast mode `fib(n - 1)` returns f64 (or the orphan i32 from Bug A).
The validator rejected the resulting binary with
`[wasm-validator error in function fib] call param types must match`.

## Fix

`src/codegen/binary-ops.ts`:

1. In the `isBooleanType / leftType.kind === "i32"` branch, route
   arithmetic ops on two i32 operands to `compileI32BinaryOp` (which
   emits `i32.add` / `i32.sub` / …) instead of the comparison-only
   `compileBooleanBinaryOp`. Falls through to `compileBooleanBinaryOp`
   only for comparison/equality ops where it actually emits something.

2. In `compileAnyBinaryDispatch`, after each operand is compiled, call
   `coerceType(ctx, fctx, operandType, anyValueTarget)` if it isn't
   already a `ref $AnyValue`. The existing `coerceType` boxing path
   uses the `__any_box_i32`, `__any_box_f64`, `__any_box_ref` helpers
   already registered by `ensureAnyHelpers`.

## Verification

- New regression test `tests/issue-1211.test.ts` covers:
  - recursive `fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)` returns the right Fibonacci
    value for n ∈ {0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15};
  - simple recursive `1 + countdown(n - 1)` doesn't drop `i32.sub`
    (was being miscompiled to a constant);
  - `run_hot` wrapper that forces AnyValue return type still produces
    a valid Wasm binary.
- Focused suites pass: 53 tests in `issue-1120`, `issue-1179`,
  `issue-1182`, `issue-1183`, `issue-1211`, `equivalence/binary-arithmetic`;
  59 tests in `issue-1128`, `issue-1160-1164`, `issue-138/139`.
- Competitive benchmark `js2wasm -> Node.js (hosted)` lane reports
  `173.9 / 44.0 / 2.2` ms for `fib-recursive` (previously
  `compile-error: [wasm-validator error in function fib]`).
