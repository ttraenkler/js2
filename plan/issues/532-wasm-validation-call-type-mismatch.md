# Issue #532: Wasm validation -- call type mismatch

## Problem

Multiple test262 tests fail Wasm validation with errors like:
- `call[0] expected type externref, found f64.const of type f64`
- `call[0] expected type externref, found f64.add of type f64`

## Root causes

1. **`tryStaticToNumber` incorrectly folds string + string to numeric addition.**
   `tryStaticToNumber` converts string literals to numbers (`Number("1") = 1`) and then
   folds `"1" + "1"` as `1 + 1 = 2` (f64). But in TS/JS, `"1" + "1"` is string
   concatenation producing `"11"`. The f64 result then gets passed to functions/ops
   expecting externref (e.g. `equals(externref, externref)`), causing Wasm validation errors.

2. **String equality comparison (`equals`) called without type coercion.**
   When one operand is f64 and the other is externref, the `equals` call (which expects
   two externref args) would receive an f64, causing validation failure.

## Fix

1. In `tryStaticToNumber`, for `PlusToken` binary expressions, check if either operand
   has a string TS type. If so, return `undefined` (cannot fold to number) since the
   `+` operator is string concatenation.

2. In the externref equality comparison path, coerce non-externref operands to externref
   before calling the `equals` import.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Fixed `tryStaticToNumber` to check `isStringType` for `PlusToken` operands before
  numeric constant folding
- Added type coercion guards before `equals` string comparison import calls

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- two targeted fixes
- `tests/call-type-mismatch-532.test.ts` -- 5 new tests

### Tests now passing
- String literal addition correctly produces string concatenation
- Mixed f64/externref comparisons validate correctly
- All 113 existing tracked tests still pass
