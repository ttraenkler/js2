# #957 -- Promise instance method imports corrupt Wasm type indices

## Problem

Commit `a337c268` (#855 Promise resolution v2) added Promise instance method imports (Promise_then, Promise_catch, Promise_finally, Promise_then2) that introduce new func types into the shared Wasm type index space. When these func types are inserted before struct types, all struct type indices shift, but import `typeIdx` references retain stale values. This produces INVALID wasm modules and caused a ~1,023 pass regression (18,594 → 17,571).

## Root Cause

In WebAssembly, func types and struct types share a **single type index space**. When #855 added Promise instance method imports:

1. `addFuncType` creates a new func type (e.g., `(externref, externref) → externref` for Promise_then)
2. This type gets index N in `ctx.mod.types`
3. All struct types registered after this point get indices N+1, N+2, etc.
4. But struct types registered BEFORE this import retain their original indices
5. Import's `typeIdx` field points to index N, which was the func type — but if struct types were registered between collection passes, index N might now point to a struct instead

The collector registered Promise instance methods during `unifiedVisitNode` and `finalizeUnifiedCollector`, which ran during the collection phase alongside struct type registration. The interleaving of func type and struct type registration corrupted the index space.

### WAT analysis confirmed

Pre-#855 WAT output showed correct type indices. Current main WAT showed `Promise_then` import referencing `(type 6)` which was actually the `$Test262Error` struct — a func type pointing at a struct definition.

### False passes

Before #855, `.then()` on Promise types fell through to a null fallback — callbacks were never executed. Tests returned 1 (pass) because no assertions failed. This inflated the pass count. The ~1,023 "regression" is partly real INVALID errors and partly the loss of these false passes.

## Sub-patterns

| Pattern | Count | Cause |
|---------|-------|-------|
| INVALID wasm binary (type mismatch in imports) | ~500 | Import typeIdx points to wrong type |
| "then is not a function" | ~200 | Promise struct receiver doesn't expose .then() in JS |
| False pass loss | ~300 | Pre-#855 null fallback meant callbacks never ran |

## Fix (implemented, not yet merged)

Remove all three components of Promise instance method handling:

1. **Collector detection** (`unifiedVisitNode` in index.ts): Removed `.then()/.catch()/.finally()` detection on Promise-typed receivers
2. **Finalizer registration** (`finalizeUnifiedCollector` in index.ts): Removed Promise_then/catch/finally/then2 import registration. Only static methods (resolve, all, race) remain.
3. **Codegen handler** (expressions.ts): Removed dedicated Promise instance method handler. Calls fall through to generic `__extern_method_call` path.

### Why not fix the index shifting?

- **Can't "just fix it"**: The `shiftLateImportIndices` mechanism handles index shifting for imports added during codegen. But Promise imports were added during the collector phase, when struct types were still being registered. The shift would need to happen mid-collection, when half the function bodies don't exist yet.
- **Can't append at end**: Types aren't appended in declaration order — they're appended when first needed via `addFuncType`/struct registration. The ordering depends on which code paths execute first during compilation.
- **Deduplication complicates**: `addFuncType` uses `funcTypeCache` with signature-based keys. If the type already exists, it returns the existing index. This means the "position" of a type depends on whether it was first needed by an import or by a function signature.

## Branch

- **Worktree**: `/tmp/fix-957`
- **Branch**: `issue-957-fix-late-import-shift`
- **Commit**: `94b3ff42`
- **Diff**: -111 lines, +16 lines across `src/codegen/expressions.ts` and `src/codegen/index.ts`

## Test Results

- 3/3 original INVALID samples now produce valid Wasm (was 0/3)
- 50 random sample: 40/50 pass (unchanged from all commits)
- 60 targeted sample: 5→1 INVALID (remaining 1 is unrelated to Promise)

## Acceptance Criteria

- No INVALID wasm modules caused by Promise import type index corruption
- Static Promise methods (resolve, all, race) still work
- Pass count recovers to pre-#855 baseline (minus false passes)
