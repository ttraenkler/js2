# #196 — Try/catch/finally: 66 compile errors

## Status: in-review
## Summary
66 test262 compile errors in `language/statements/try`. Try-catch-finally blocks have compilation issues beyond the throw-replacement workaround.

## Motivation
66 compile errors. Error patterns:
- 20 "type not assignable" — catch variable typing issues
- 7 "Unsupported call expression" — calls inside try/catch
- 2 wasm validation "undeclared reference to function" — function hoisting across try blocks
- Others: scope/variable resolution issues

Try/catch is partially supported but many patterns fail. The catch clause variable is untyped in JS (`catch (e)`) which causes TS type errors.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — try/catch/finally codegen
- Catch variable typing in allowJs mode

## Complexity
M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Catch variable `e` correctly typed as `any` in allowJs
- [ ] Functions declared inside try blocks are accessible
- [ ] 20+ test262 try/catch compile errors fixed

## Implementation notes
- Extended `hoistFunctionDeclarations` in `src/codegen/statements.ts` to recurse into try/catch/finally blocks
- Function declarations inside try blocks are now properly hoisted to the enclosing function scope
- Catch clause variable handling was already correct (allocated as externref)
- Added equivalence tests for function-in-try and try-catch variable patterns
