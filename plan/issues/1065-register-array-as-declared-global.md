# #1065 — Register `Array` as a declared global for identity comparison

## Status: Reverted along with parent #1057's PR #100 on 2026-04-11

This issue file was originally created as part of dev-1047's PR #100 (runtime
half of #1057). When PR #100 was reverted via PR #114 (the 3-PR combined
rescue for the 2026-04-11 CI baseline drift), this issue file was removed
with it. Recovered from `git show 2dc095ac:plan/issues/1065.md` as
part of the revert documentation pass.

dev-1047 additionally shipped the compiler-half fix as **PR #108**
(branch `issue-1065-array-declared-global`, with host_eq helper +
declared-global registry + LIB_GLOBALS extension). **PR #108 did NOT land**
— it was closed along with the broader pause. The branch is preserved on
origin.

When the #1057/#1065 reland sequence comes around, the compiler-half fix
on `origin/issue-1065-array-declared-global` is the starting point along
with recovering the runtime-half 9 LOC from `git show 2dc095ac`.

## Problem

Bare `Array` identifier in RHS positions (e.g. `x.constructor === Array`) compiles
to `ref.null extern` because the compiler has `sym?.name !== "Array"` carve-outs
in the declared-global lookup path. This breaks ~68 test262 tests in the #1057
cluster (`String.prototype.split.*.constructor === Array`) and any other test
that compares a constructor against `Array` by identity.

The runtime half of the fix landed in #1057's partial PR (#100): `__extern_get`
now returns the real `Array` constructor for opaque WasmGC structs with no
registered field names (vec wrappers). That half is a no-op until the compiler
stops short-circuiting `Array` identifier lookups.

## Evidence

- **Parent issue:** #1057 (68 FAIL, `argument-is-regexp*`, `arguments-are-new-reg-exp*`, `call-split*`)
- **Runtime side already fixed:** `src/runtime.ts` `case "extern_get"` at L2443 — see PR #100.
- **Compiler carve-outs to audit:** `src/codegen/index.ts` contains `sym?.name !== "Array"` / `sym.name === "Array"` guards at (approximately) L3264, L3514, L3774, L4748. These were added to protect `Array` fast paths (`new Array(n)`, `Array.of`, etc.) but they also prevent `Array` from being resolved as a declared global in identity-comparison positions.
- **Observed behavior:** in a split-result probe, the `.constructor` member access never reaches `__extern_get` with key = `"constructor"`; instead the compiler emits either a literal key (`[Function: Object]` observed in host trap) or `ref.null extern` on the RHS. Needs architect investigation.

## Fix sketch

1. Add `Array` (and probably `Object`, `Function`, etc.) to the declared-globals registry used by the identifier-resolution path.
2. Keep existing `new Array(...)` / `Array.of` fast paths — the carve-outs can become *alias* checks (fast path if the identifier is in a call position) rather than *exclusion* checks.
3. When bare `Array` appears in a RHS position (identity comparison, assignment, argument), emit a `global.get` of the declared-global import so the runtime returns the real host `Array` constructor.
4. Verify `.constructor` member access compiles to `__extern_get(obj, "constructor")` (not a fast-path that resolves at compile time).

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§23.1.1 The Array Constructor](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array-constructor) — Array is the intrinsic %Array% constructor
- [§23.1.3.5 Array.prototype.constructor](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.constructor) — Array.prototype.constructor is the intrinsic %Array% (i.e., `x.constructor === Array` must hold for literal arrays)


## Acceptance criteria

- `x.constructor === Array` returns `true` for values produced by `String.split`, `Array.map`, array literals, etc.
- The 68 tests in the #1057 cluster pass (or the cluster drops to ≤10 FAIL).
- No regressions in tests that rely on the `Array` fast paths (`new Array(n)`, `Array.of`, `Array.from`, `Array.isArray`).

## Notes

- This is the **compiler half** of the split between PR #100 (runtime) and #1065 (compiler). Landing the compiler half without reverting #100 is the intended path — the runtime already handles the host side correctly.
- Architect spec recommended (`/architect-spec`) — touches identifier resolution which is a hot path and has historically been fragile to changes in the `Array` carve-out.
