# #999 -- for-of / for-await-of destructuring still emits f64↔externref and struct field mismatches (75 CE)

## Problem

The latest full recheck (`benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260407-111308.jsonl`)
shows **75 compile errors** in two newly separable invalid-binary subclusters:

- `call[0] expected type externref, found call of type f64` — `63`
- `struct.new[0] expected type f64, found local.get of type (ref null 21)` — `12`

The enriched errors show these are not generic type-mismatch leftovers. They
cluster specifically around `for-of` / `for-await-of` destructuring.

## Representative samples

### `call[0] expected type externref, found call of type f64`

- `test/language/statements/for-of/dstr/obj-id-identifier-yield-ident-valid.js`
  - `L22:3 ... call[0] expected type externref, found call of type f64 @+1140`
- `test/language/statements/for-of/dstr/obj-prop-identifier-resolution-first.js`
  - `L22:3 ... call[0] expected type externref, found call of type f64 @+1138`
- `test/language/statements/for-await-of/async-func-decl-dstr-obj-rest-valid-object.js`
  - `L33:3 ... fn ... call[0] expected type externref, found call of type f64 @+2605`

### `struct.new[0] expected type f64, found local.get of type (ref null 21)`

- `test/language/statements/for-await-of/async-func-dstr-var-async-ary-ptrn-elision.js`
  - `L72:3 ... __closure_0 ... struct.new[0] expected type f64 ... @+2300`
- `test/language/statements/for-await-of/async-gen-dstr-let-async-ary-ptrn-rest-ary-elision.js`
  - `L101:3 ... __closure_0 ... struct.new[0] expected type f64 ... @+2323`
- `test/language/statements/for-await-of/async-gen-dstr-var-async-ary-ptrn-elision.js`
  - `L88:3 ... __closure_0 ... struct.new[0] expected type f64 ... @+2323`

## WAT / source clue

The first subcluster points at destructuring loops whose generated test/closure
function still returns or forwards `f64` into an externref-typed call slot:

```wat
(func $test (result f64) ... call[0] expected type externref, found call of type f64 ...)
```

The second points at async destructuring closures building a struct with the
wrong field type:

```wat
(func $__closure_0 ... struct.new[0] expected type f64, found local.get of type (ref null 21) ...)
```

## Relationship to prior work

This is adjacent to #847, but it is a compile-time codegen bucket, not the
existing runtime wrong-values bucket. The new source/WAT detail shows that the
remaining failures are in type coercion and closure-struct materialization
inside destructuring loop lowering.

## Suggested fix

1. Trace `for-of` / `for-await-of` destructuring codegen in `src/codegen/statements.ts`
2. Fix the callsite coercion path where a computed `f64` value is passed into an
   externref-typed helper/callee
3. Fix async destructuring closure struct construction where a ref-typed local is
   written into an `f64` field
4. Add regression tests for:
   - `for-of/dstr/obj-*`
   - `for-await-of/*async-ary-ptrn-elision*`

## Acceptance criteria

- eliminate the 75 destructuring-loop invalid-binary CEs
- both the `call[0] externref<-f64` and `struct.new[0] f64<-ref` subclusters are gone in the next full recheck

## Implementation Summary

Fixed two distinct type-mismatch bugs in for-of destructuring and async generator closures.

### Bug 1: Double-coercion in `compileForOfAssignDestructuring` (`src/codegen/statements/loops.ts`)

**Root cause**: In `compileForOfAssignDestructuring`, when a struct field value (f64) needed to
be stored into a target variable with a different type (externref), the code called `coerceType`
to convert f64→externref on the stack, then passed the original `fieldType` (f64) to
`emitCoercedLocalSet`. `emitCoercedLocalSet` saw the mismatch and tried to coerce again,
producing an invalid `call[0] expected type externref, found call of type f64` error.

**Fix**: Compute `effectiveStackType` — the actual type on the stack after any explicit coercion
— and pass that to `emitCoercedLocalSet`:

```typescript
const effectiveStackType = targetType && !valTypesMatch(fieldType, targetType) ? targetType : fieldType;
if (targetType && !valTypesMatch(fieldType, targetType)) {
  coerceType(ctx, fctx, fieldType, targetType);
}
emitCoercedLocalSet(ctx, fctx, targetLocal, effectiveStackType);
```

### Bug 2: Missing transitive captures in `compileArrowAsClosure` (`src/codegen/closures.ts`)

**Root cause**: When an async generator closure called a nested function `g()` that had
mutable captures (e.g. `first`, `second` as f64 ref cells), the closure's `referencedNames`
set didn't include `first`/`second`. At the call site, the code fell through to `outerLocalIdx`
which resolved to local index 0 in the lifted function's namespace — that turned out to be
`self` (ref null 15), not the expected f64 value — producing `struct.new[0] expected type f64,
found local.get of type (ref null N)`.

**Fix**: After collecting `referencedNames` in `compileArrowAsClosure`, expand transitively
through `ctx.nestedFuncCaptures` to include all captures needed by called nested functions:

```typescript
for (const name of [...referencedNames]) {
  const transitiveCaptures = ctx.nestedFuncCaptures.get(name);
  if (transitiveCaptures) {
    for (const cap of transitiveCaptures) {
      referencedNames.add(cap.name);
    }
  }
}
```

### Tests

Added `tests/issue-999-repro.test.ts` with 4 regression tests:
1. for-of obj-assign-destructuring: f64 field into externref var (null-typed)
2. for-of obj-assign-destructuring: shorthand, any-typed target
3. for-of obj-assign-destructuring with typed struct element
4. for-await-of array elision destructuring with async generator

All 4 tests pass. PR #55 merged, all CI checks green.
