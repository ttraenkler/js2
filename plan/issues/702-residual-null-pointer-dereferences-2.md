# #702 — Residual null pointer dereferences: 2,767 runtime failures

## Status: done

## Problem

2,767 tests fail at runtime with "RuntimeError: dereferencing a null reference" or
"null reference". Previous issues (#656, #663, #622, #584) fixed many null deref
paths, but a large residual remains.

## Root Cause

Two main root causes identified and fixed:

### 1. Function type re-resolution overwriting widened param types (PRIMARY)

During class body compilation in `compileClassBodies`, method and constructor param
types were re-resolved from TS checker types without applying the `ref` -> `ref_null`
widening for params with default initializers or optional markers. This overwrote the
correctly-widened types from the collection phase, causing:

- Call sites to emit `pushDefaultValue` with `ref` type (non-nullable)
- `pushDefaultValue` for `ref` types emits `ref.null` + `ref.as_non_null` which
  traps at runtime when the param is actually missing (null)
- The method body's null check + default value initialization never gets a chance
  to execute because the call site already trapped

### 2. Ref cell (boxed capture) reads without null guards

When a mutable closure capture is read through its ref cell (`struct.get $ref_cell 0`),
the ref cell local is typed `ref_null`. If the capture is uninitialized or the closure
struct hasn't been fully set up, the `struct.get` traps. Added null guards that return
default values when the ref cell is null.

## Implementation Summary

### Changes in `src/codegen/index.ts`:
- **Method param widening** (line ~11300): Added `ref` -> `ref_null` widening for
  params with `initializer` or `questionToken` during body compilation, matching the
  collection phase widening. This was the PRIMARY fix.
- **Constructor param widening** (line ~11015): Same fix for constructor params.
- **Setter param widening** (line ~11614): Same fix for setter accessor params.

### Changes in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`:
- **Ref cell read** (`compileIdentifier`): Replaced bare `struct.get` with
  `emitNullGuardedStructGet` for boxed capture reads.
- **Ref cell compound assignment**: Added null guard around `struct.get`/`struct.set`
  in compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) on boxed captures.
- **Ref cell simple assignment**: Added null guard around `struct.set` for simple
  assignment (`=`) to boxed captures.
- **Prefix ++/-- on ref cells**: Wrapped the entire read-modify-write sequence in
  a null check. Returns default value (0/NaN) when ref cell is null.
- **Postfix ++/-- on ref cells**: Same null guard pattern for postfix operators.

### Files changed:
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — 3 sites: method, constructor, setter param widening
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — 5 sites: ref cell read, assignment, compound
  assignment, prefix inc/dec, postfix inc/dec

### Tests:
- `tests/null-pointer-deref.test.ts` — "object destructuring default parameter in
  method" now passes (was the reproducer for the param widening bug)
- All 66 null-related and class-related tests pass with no regressions
