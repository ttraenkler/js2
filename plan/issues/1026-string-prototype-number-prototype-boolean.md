# #1026 — Built-in `.prototype` globals compile to `ref.null.extern`

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§22.1.3 Properties of the String Prototype Object](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-string-prototype-object) — String.prototype is a String exotic object with value ""
- [§21.1.3 Properties of the Number Prototype Object](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-number-prototype-object) — Number.prototype has \[\[NumberData\]\] = +0
- [§20.3.3 Properties of the Boolean Prototype Object](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-boolean-prototype-object) — Boolean.prototype has \[\[BooleanData\]\] = false


## Problem

Identified by dev-929 while working on PR #43 (#929). When code accesses `String.prototype` / `Number.prototype` / `Boolean.prototype` as a value expression, the compiler emits `ref.null.extern` because it has no JS-globals accessor for these.

Until PR #43, about 12 `test/language/statements/variable/15.2.3.6-3-*-1.js` tests **coincidentally passed** on main because the downstream code (e.g. `String.prototype.writable = true`) compiled into a harmless `drop`. Once PR #43 made descriptor compilation more correct, the tests try to actually use `String.prototype` and hit a runtime exception on the null externref.

Those tests were **never really passing** — they're false positives per the regression-analysis guidance. They should either:
1. Be tracked honestly in the baseline as `fail` (and then flip to `pass` once this issue lands)
2. Be skipped with an entry referencing this issue
3. Be fixed by actually wiring up the builtin prototypes

## Fix

Expose `String.prototype`, `Number.prototype`, `Boolean.prototype` via the JS globals host accessor. In JS-host mode these are trivially `globalThis.String.prototype` etc. In standalone mode they should route to the corresponding WasmGC prototype struct.

Track the null-externref emission in `src/codegen/expressions/property-access.ts` (the property access on a built-in constructor's `.prototype`).

## Expected impact

**Updated 2026-04-11 post-Sprint-41 merges:** the Sprint 41 CI delta showed this pattern produced ~20 test262 regressions (pass → fail), all with the same error:

```
TypeError (null/undefined access): Object.defineProperty - 'Attributes' is a String object ...
```

Affected buckets:
- `test/built-ins/Object/defineProperty/15.2.3.6-3-*-1.js` (~12 tests — String wrapper)
- `test/built-ins/Object/defineProperty/15.2.3.6-3-167-1.js` through `-175-1.js` (several — Boolean wrapper)
- `test/built-ins/Object/defineProperties/15.2.3.7-6-a-259/280/*` (several — Number wrapper)

All are pre-existing false positives that were "passing" on main only because our `String.prototype.writable = true` compiled to a harmless `drop`. PR #43 made defineProperty actually run, and these now honestly fail. Fixing #1026 flips them all back to pass.

## Notes

**Priority raised to HIGH** after Sprint 41 merge exposure — this is now the biggest cluster of spurious regressions blocking the Sprint 41 pass delta from being visible in the main baseline.

Not a blocker for sprint merge (the net delta is +479 pass overwhelmingly positive), but a clean fix here would add ~20 to the next baseline refresh.
