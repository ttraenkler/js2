# Issue 52: String.split() method

## Summary

Support `string.split()` — the most commonly used string method that's currently missing.

## Current behavior

14 string methods are supported via host imports (toUpperCase, toLowerCase, trim, charAt,
slice, substring, indexOf, includes, startsWith, endsWith, replace, repeat, padStart, padEnd).
`split()` is not supported.

## Desired behavior

```ts
const parts = "a,b,c".split(",");  // ["a", "b", "c"]
const chars = "hello".split("");   // ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
```

## Implementation

### Codegen
- Add `string_split` to the host import list in `addStringImports` or the string method
  dispatch
- Return type: `externref` (array of strings, managed by host)
- Or: return a wasm GC `(array externref)` by having the host create it

### Runtime
- Already handled by the generic `string_*` proxy pattern in `jsApi`
- `string_split` → `(s, ...a) => s.split(...a)` — works automatically

### Challenge
- Return type: `split()` returns `string[]` — need to decide if this is a host array
  (externref) or a wasm GC array of externref
- Simplest: return as externref, access elements via `__extern_get`

## Complexity

S — ~50 lines, 1-2 files
