# #5141 — ES2015 standalone: generators conformance wave 1

## Problem

166 of the 186 ES2015-bucket "generators" work-package tests still fail on the
standalone target (re-verified on head `86739f05`, 2026-08-28; 20 of the
day-old baseline already pass). Worse, **head carries a live regression**:
PR #5060 (merge `8896b73f`, 2026-08-28 13:48 UTC) makes EVERY native-generator
first resume trap `RuntimeError: unreachable` on Node 22 — 25 of the 40
previously-passing spotcheck tests now fail (measured: spotcheck 15/40 pass on
head vs 40/40 at baseline). The remaining failures cluster into 10 root causes;
the top five cover 86% of the list. Generators are a load-bearing ES2015
feature (for-of, destructuring, iteration protocol all consume them), so this
package gates the 100% ES2015 standalone goal.

The `loc-budget-allow` grant above is deliberate growth allowance for this
change-set (yield* gate widening, generator object-model installs, brand
checks), rationale dated 2026-08-28 (this issue). The sibling class wave
(#5139) independently observed the same head regression via its own spotcheck.

Target list (regenerate after cluster B lands — see Plan step 0):
`.tmp/es2015/wp-generators-current-fails.txt` (166 paths).
Probe: `npx tsx .tmp/run-standalone.mts --list <file>` (split >150 lines).

## Current failure clusters

Counts from the 2026-08-28 head re-run (166 fails). Clusters ordered by yield.

| # | Cluster | Count | Root cause (file:function) | Sample tests |
|---|---------|-------|----------------------------|--------------|
| B | resume-trap regression | 39 (+25 spotcheck collateral) | `src/codegen/generators-native.ts:4419-4438` (`ensureNativeGeneratorResumeFunction`): PR #5060's close-on-abrupt wrapper emits the codebase's only **result-typed** `try_table` (`1f 63 2d` — blocktype `(ref null $result)`); Node 22's V8 12.4 traps `unreachable` at that instruction on first execution (every other call site — `promise-executor.ts:192`, `calls.ts:152`, statement try/catch — uses empty blocktype `1f 40` and works). Verified by bisect (good `5fe8ddbb`, bad `8896b73f`) and by reverting the single hunk at head → repro passes. CI's newer Node runs it fine, which is why the merge_group stayed green. | `language/expressions/generators/yield-as-statement.js`, `language/statements/generators/no-yield.js`, `built-ins/GeneratorPrototype/next/return-yield-expr.js` |
| A1 | `yield*` delegation rejected (#680 CE) | 38 | `src/codegen/generators-native.ts:838-960` — delegation admits only: direct native-gen call (#2170), numeric vec (#2173-2a), type-visible generic iterable (#2173-2b). `isGenericIterableDelegate` (line 1052) requires the TS type to expose `__@iterator`, so sloppy-JS hand-rolled iterator objects (`obj[Symbol.iterator] = fn`) bail; `yield*` inside a non-replay try-region hard-bails (line 843, #3050). | `language/expressions/yield/star-iterable.js`, `star-rhs-iter-thrw-thrw-call-non-obj.js`, `star-rhs-iter-rtrn-res-value-final.js` |
| F2 | GeneratorFunction intrinsic | 17 | No `%GeneratorFunction%` object model: `constructor`/`name`/`length`/`prototype` descriptors, `Symbol.toStringTag`, `has-instance` all missing. Prototype-chain singletons exist in `src/codegen/array-object-proto.ts:2884` (`__native_generator_function_prototype`) but the constructor-function object and its descriptors are not installed. 5 of the 17 (`invoked-as-function-*`, `instance-yield-expr-in-param`) need **dynamic function creation from strings** — eval-class, defer. | `built-ins/GeneratorFunction/name.js`, `prototype/Symbol.toStringTag.js`, `instance-length.js` |
| F1 | generator fn object model | 16 | No per-generator-function own `.prototype` data property: instances don't get `[[Prototype]]` from `g.prototype`, `g1.prototype === g2.prototype` (should differ), `typeof g.prototype === "undefined"`, `instanceof` fails. `.prototype` reads route through the shared intrinsic (`src/codegen/property-access-dispatch.ts:1958,2084`) instead of a per-function slot. | `language/statements/generators/prototype-uniqueness.js`, `language/expressions/generators/has-instance.js`, `default-proto.js` |
| A3 | misc shape rejects (#680 CE) | 12 | Candidacy/plan gates (`isNativeGeneratorCandidate` line 2241, `buildNativeGeneratorPlan` line 440): non-numeric/non-string yield operands (regexp, template-middle, primitives via boxed-any carrier gaps in `generatorElemValType` line 379), rest params, `yield` in relational expr. | `language/expressions/yield/rhs-regexp.js`, `rhs-template-middle.js`, `in-rltn-expr.js` |
| C | dstr runtime failures | 11 | Pattern-param destructuring inside generators: `Cannot destructure 'null' or 'undefined'` for `[[] = init]`-style params (frame rehydration drops the argument — #3386 residual class); 4 `iter-get-err-array-prototype` tests need GetIterator failure → TypeError before body entry. | `language/statements/generators/dstr/ary-ptrn-elem-ary-empty-init.js`, `dstr/ary-init-iter-get-err-array-prototype.js` |
| A2 | dstr-param rejects (#680 CE) | 8 | Same admission gate as A1/A3: destructuring param shapes not admitted by the fn-expr/param-shape gates in `isNativeGeneratorCandidate`. | `language/expressions/generators/dstr/ary-ptrn-elem-id-init-fn-name-gen.js` |
| D | `yield`-identifier early error | 8 | `src/compiler/early-errors/module-rules.ts:204-223`: the upward walk looking for an enclosing generator **does not stop at non-generator function boundaries**, so `yield` as an identifier inside an ordinary function nested in a generator (legal, [~Yield] resets) is rejected; sloppy top-level `var yield` also errors when the source is treated as module/strict. The `await` rule directly below (line 228+) already walks correctly — mirror it. | `language/expressions/generators/yield-as-identifier-in-nested-function.js`, `yield-identifier-non-strict.js` |
| G | fn-name binding semantics | 5 | Named generator expression's name binding: strict-mode reassignment must throw TypeError, sloppy must be immutable-silent (#2037/#1049 class of fix, applied to generator expressions). | `named-strict-error-reassign-fn-name-in-body.js`, `scope-name-var-open-strict.js` |
| F3 | GeneratorPrototype brand/ctor | 5 | `next`/`throw`/`return` must be non-constructors (`new gen.next` → TypeError), `%GeneratorPrototype%.constructor` descriptor; brand-check work overlaps in-flight #1344. | `built-ins/GeneratorPrototype/next/not-a-constructor.js`, `constructor.js` |
| E | invalid-Wasm CE | 3 | Rest-param generators emit `__call_fn_*` with wrong call_ref arity; `statements/.../yield-star-before-newline.js` hits a `local.tee` type mismatch in `__gen_resume_g`. | `language/expressions/generators/scope-param-rest-elem-var-open.js` |
| H | env: quickjs eval provider not built | 4 | Not a compiler bug: `JS2WASM_EVAL_ENGINE=quickjs` but `.test262-cache/quickjs-artifact-*` missing in this container. Excluded from acceptance. | `built-ins/GeneratorFunction/proto-from-ctor-realm.js` |

## Implementation Plan

Ordered so partial completion maximizes yield. Steps 1 is a REGRESSION fix and
must land first (alone if necessary — it un-breaks ~25+ currently-regressed
tests beyond this package's 39).

**Step 0 — after each cluster lands, re-run the probe over
`.tmp/es2015/wp-generators-current-fails.txt` and re-cluster.** Cluster B masks
downstream errors (e.g. the three `from-state-executing` tests currently trap
in B but will still need the §27.5.3 "executing"-state TypeError afterwards).
Regenerate the list; do not trust this table's error text after step 1.

**Step 1 — Cluster B (39 + spotcheck collateral): reshape the #5060 close-on-abrupt wrapper.**
- File: `src/codegen/generators-native.ts`, `ensureNativeGeneratorResumeFunction`,
  the `if (ctx.standalone || ctx.wasi)` branch at ~4419.
- Keep #5060's intent (§27.5.3.4: an unhandled body exception must set
  `STATE_FIELD` to `doneState` before propagating — see
  `plan/issues/4768-generator-argument-eagerly-drained-at-call-boundary.md`),
  but do NOT emit a result-typed `try_table`. Re-emit with the empty-blocktype
  shape every other standalone EH site uses (model:
  `src/codegen/promise-executor.ts:192`, `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts:152`,
  both `buildStandardTryTable({kind:"empty"}, …)`): route the normal-path
  result through `resultLocal` and a `br` past the handler, e.g.
  `block $out(result R) { block $h(payload externref) { try_table (catch $exc $h) { <trampoline>; } br $out (local.get resultLocal) } <setState done>; throw $exc }`
  — the trampoline already `local.set`s `resultLocal`, so no blocktype is
  needed on the try_table itself. `buildStandardTryTable` bumps escaping
  branch depths for you; verify with the repro below, not by eye.
- Alternative (equally acceptable): drop the wrapper and set `doneState`
  inside the existing explicit throw paths + the exnref rethrow seam, if all
  abrupt exits are enumerable.
- Repro (must go from RUN_TRAP to RUN_OK on Node 22):
  compile `function *foo() { yield 1; } var g = foo(); g.next();` with
  `target: "standalone"`, instantiate with `{}`, call `_start`. Then run the
  40-line `.tmp/es2015/wp-generators-passing-spotcheck.txt` — all 40 must pass
  (today: 15). Also keep the #5060 win: `tests/issue-4768-generator-call-boundary.test.ts`
  must stay green.
- Why it trapped: the wrapper is the only result-typed `try_table` the emitter
  produces; V8 12.4 (Node 22, `package.json` engines `>=20`) executes it as
  `unreachable`. CI's Node is newer, so the merge_group missed it — add a
  scoped vitest (equivalence or issue test) exercising a standalone generator
  resume so the local lane catches any recurrence.

**Step 2 — Cluster A1 (38): widen `yield*` delegation.**
- File: `src/codegen/generators-native.ts` lines 838-960 + the drivers in
  `generators-native-consumer.ts` / `iterator-native.ts`.
- 2a. Replace the type-driven `isGenericIterableDelegate` (line 1052 — note it
  is pre-oracle `ctx.checker` code; NEW code must go through `ctx.oracle`,
  #1930/#3273) with an admit-by-default runtime `GetIterator` path: lower
  `yield* <expr>` to the native `__iterator`/`__iterator_next` runtime
  (#2038) with a runtime TypeError when the operand is not iterable. Follow
  the existing slice-2b emit (search `delegationKind: "iterable"`) — the
  runtime driver already exists; the gate is the blocker.
- 2b. Delegation protocol completeness (the `star-rhs-iter-*` family):
  forward `.throw()`/`.return()` into the delegate per §27.5.3.7 —
  `GetMethod(iterator, "throw"/"return")`, TypeError on non-object inner
  results, `done`-value passthrough. #1691 (in_progress) owns part of this;
  check its branch before implementing, reference rather than duplicate.
- 2c. `yield*` inside try-regions (line 843 hard bail): keep bailing in this
  wave if 2a/2b land without it — but the bail must remain the clean #680
  diagnostic, never silent wrong codegen. Cite #3050.
- Blocked sibling #3711 (yield-star delegation illegal cast) documents a known
  cast pitfall in the consumer — read it before touching the driver.

**Step 3 — Clusters F1+F2+F3 (38, minus 5 deferred): generator object model.**
- 3a. Per-function `.prototype` (F1): give every generator function object an
  own writable, non-enumerable, non-configurable `.prototype` data slot
  initialized to a fresh object whose `[[Prototype]]` is
  `%GeneratorPrototype%`; the factory must stamp instances with it, and
  `instanceof` must honor it. Emit sites: `src/codegen/array-object-proto.ts`
  (~2767-2960, the `__native_generator_prototype_obj` /
  `__native_generator_function_prototype` singletons) and
  `src/codegen/property-access-dispatch.ts:1958,2084` (`.prototype` reads —
  currently return the shared intrinsic). #3236 (ready, sprint current) owns
  retiring the host-import twins of these singletons — coordinate: this issue
  needs the per-function slot; #3236 needs the intrinsic chain host-free. Do
  not double-claim; if #3236 is picked up first, build on its branch
  (predecessor-stacking per CLAUDE.md).
- 3b. `%GeneratorFunction%` descriptors (F2, 12 of 17): install the
  constructor object with `name: "GeneratorFunction"`, `length: 1`,
  `prototype` → `%GeneratorFunction.prototype%` (non-writable per test
  `prototype/constructor.js`), `Symbol.toStringTag: "GeneratorFunction"`
  (configurable), extensibility, `has-instance` via the prototype chain.
- 3c. Non-constructor + restricted properties (F1/F3): `new g()` and
  `new gen.next` must throw TypeError; `g.caller`/`g.arguments` must be
  poisoned accessors. Brand checks on `next`/`throw`/`return` receivers
  overlap #1344 (in-progress) — check its state first.
- DEFER (state in the PR, do not attempt): dynamic
  `GeneratorFunction(...)` invocation tests (5: `invoked-as-function-*`,
  `invoked-as-constructor-no-arguments`, `instance-yield-expr-in-param`) —
  they require compiling function bodies from strings at runtime (eval-class,
  #1102/#1261 territory).

**Step 4 — Clusters A2+A3 (20): admission-gate widening.**
- Instrument first: add a temporary `.tmp/` probe that logs WHICH gate in
  `isNativeGeneratorCandidate` (line 2241) / `buildNativeGeneratorPlan`
  (line 440) refuses each A2/A3 test — the #680 message is one string for
  many gates; do not guess.
- Expected buckets: boxed-any carrier not selected for regexp/template/
  primitive yield operands (`generatorElemValType` line 379 — the #2864
  externref carrier exists, extend its admission); destructuring params
  (A2 — combine with cluster C's rehydration fix, #3386's pattern-param seam);
  rest params (also cluster E's `__call_fn_*` arity bug — fix the arity, then
  admit).

**Step 5 — Cluster D (8): scope the `yield`-identifier early error.**
- File: `src/compiler/early-errors/module-rules.ts:204-223`. Stop the
  enclosing-generator walk at the first non-arrow function boundary (a nested
  ordinary function/expression resets [Yield]; the fn-expr's own
  binding-identifier position follows the inner context). The `await` rule at
  line 228+ in the same file already implements the correct
  walk-to-function-boundary pattern — mirror it. Confirm the sloppy
  script-goal path (`yield-identifier-non-strict.js`) reaches this rule with
  `sourceFileIsModule === false`; if not, the bug is in the runner's
  script/module goal selection — fix the early-error rule's input, NOT the
  runner.

### 2026-09-28 follow-up — decorator expression inherits outer `[Yield]` context

**Status: validated narrow early-error slice; no decorator runtime-semantics
claim.** The frozen original
`test/language/statements/class/decorator/syntax/valid/decorator-member-expr-identifier-reference-yield.js`
is a `noStrict` script whose relevant shape is `function yield() {}; @yield
class C {}`. It is currently rejected by this repository's own
`checkReservedIdentifiers` message, not merely by the TypeScript parser.

The source-supported boundary is narrower than the existing Cluster-D
function-boundary repair. `checkReservedIdentifiers` rejects `yield` when
`isStrictMode(node) || sourceFileIsModule || isInYieldParamContext(node)`.
`isStrictMode` currently climbs from the decorator expression into its enclosing
class and treats every class as a strict terminal. A class *body* is strict, but
evaluation of a direct class decorator expression uses the enclosing context;
in a sloppy script it is therefore `[~Yield]`. A member decorator is different:
its ancestry reaches the class through the member, so it remains within the
class's strict context.

**Narrow implementation and proof.** In
`src/compiler/early-errors/predicates.ts::isStrictMode`, retain the immediate
child while walking ancestors. Before consulting `strictModeCache` or applying
the class terminal, recognise only a direct `Decorator` listed by
`ts.getDecorators(currentClass)`. For that one edge, continue to the class's
parent without reading or writing a cache entry for the class itself. This
prevents a prior class-body query cached as `true` from rejecting the decorator,
and prevents the sloppy outer result from poisoning later class-body queries.
All other class descendants — class name, heritage, body, and member decorators
— keep the existing strict terminal. `module-rules.ts` should remain the sole
consumer unless validation exposes a separate contextual rule.

**Focused proof plan.** Add a dedicated early-error test with relevant-body
reproductions of the no-strict original and expression twin. It must separately
retain rejection for: an outer `"use strict"` script; module-goal source; a
valid-AST generator `[Yield]` identifier; a class body occurrence; and a member
decorator occurrence. Query the same parsed AST in both orders (body then
decorator, decorator then body) to pin the cache boundary. Keep the direct
decorator-in-generator source as a parser-recovery diagnostic rather than an
early-error AST control. Run the actual original through the maintained
standalone Test262 path only after the focused check is green, and keep
decorator evaluation out of the claimed outcome unless that later runtime route
is measured.

**Authoritative post-unit cohort.** Do not treat a native Node syntax check as
a decorator oracle: it does not parse this proposal. Once a lease is available,
run the maintained runner with the original flags intact over all six frozen
no-strict decorator-`yield` rows:

- `language/statements/class/decorator/syntax/valid/decorator-member-expr-identifier-reference-yield.js`
- `language/statements/class/decorator/syntax/valid/decorator-call-expr-identifier-reference-yield.js`
- `language/statements/class/decorator/syntax/valid/decorator-parenthesized-expr-identifier-reference-yield.js`
- `language/expressions/class/decorator/syntax/valid/decorator-member-expr-identifier-reference-yield.js`
- `language/expressions/class/decorator/syntax/valid/decorator-call-expr-identifier-reference-yield.js`
- `language/expressions/class/decorator/syntax/valid/decorator-parenthesized-expr-identifier-reference-yield.js`

Pair them with the source-verified corpus negatives for generator `[Yield]`
and strict code:
`language/expressions/generators/yield-as-identifier-reference.js` and
`language/expressions/generators/yield-identifier-strict.js`. Add a relevant
decorator identifier-reference control only after a baseline receipt establishes
it as passing. Preserve the noStrict/module/strict flags rather than reproducing
the paths through an ad-hoc parser. The unit fixture proves only early-error
admission; a Test262 gain is not credited until this cohort has a complete
baseline/candidate receipt.

**Authoritative matched receipt (2026-09-28).** The maintained standalone
runner used the same validated nine-path manifest in both arms (manifest
SHA-256 `75c5c6cbc6311db8c37957ab7bf7cc07d0a3673812ea8704628da28f19e602a3`),
with Node 24.19, QuickJS, `auto` semantic providers, one 4-GiB fork, recycled
realms, UTC, proposals enabled, and the Temporal provider deliberately
unlinked. The baseline was source base
`45ce4a8e207742df5ca3888c0a458e8a48ee1655` with the predicate pre-change;
it completed 9/9 verdicts: 3 pass and all six no-strict decorator-`yield`
originals as compile errors. The candidate restored only this direct-decorator
edge change and completed 9/9: all nine pass. Thus the six exact originals
transitioned CE → pass, while the two corpus negative controls and the distinct
decorator identifier-reference control remained pass → pass; there were no
exclusions or missing callbacks.

Baseline evidence: JSONL SHA-256
`9a0ceb6df49328bb96ee623d645c3e65f36ab7fc27c4d1eae96eaedc291a24e3`,
completion SHA-256
`effa56c6d3b6ebaa85155a05f229a050723ac4aab6a55f7510ae6ebd8055ae6a`,
compiler-bundle key `3be400279eb53978`, and QuickJS adapter key
`ac848c5ba005512d`. Candidate evidence: terminal runner receipt `62420`,
exit 0 in 19.48 s; JSONL SHA-256
`7aa6cc72b9454139de1b421cdbe0f8c8d611d961f41ee3b906f8662d9af258c0`,

`c0e8a1cb17e2e29f3fca031f2687906e0e736b02d683c743c2e743d3fd2c8e51`,
compiler-bundle key `efaf883716817c63`, and QuickJS adapter key
`63b801db0571a47c`. The shared QuickJS artifact was
`e9f8d30bc347dbc56f31b3389f7696eb6dedc9f05ea729781fc412f09a3e6b17`.
This closes only the decorator-yield early-error sub-slice; the broader
generator-conformance issue remains in review.

**Focused unit receipt (2026-09-28; source base
`45ce4a8e207742df5ca3888c0a458e8a48ee1655`).** The focused fixture SHA-256
was `648b843335922304fed6bdbae68096827b6eb6fec2233e15812b853e7c267bda`
for both arms. With the pre-change predicate SHA-256
`527940ea88ef1ece8cce7f296e0ed91f801a64a416ca26024520676955064620`, the
single-fork Node 24.19 Vitest receipt `7d6037` was terminal exit 1: 3 passed,
2 failed (the two intended no-strict/cache-boundary positives). After the
direct-decorator edge change, predicate SHA-256
`6383830df32a15b3a9c11a09b111cd5a5a49ce5c41c2ea0faeeefe2b82914434`, receipt
`a0ea72` was terminal exit 0: 5 passed. These are terminal tool-receipt IDs,
not retained process/session handles. Strictness neighbors
`issue-1931.test.ts` and `issue-6491-r2-real-early-errors.test.ts` then passed
33/33 in terminal receipt `16e56e`; TS7 `pnpm typecheck` passed in terminal
receipt `522953`. `function* g() { @yield class C {} }` remains a separate
parse-aware diagnostic: TypeScript reports TS1109 and creates no `yield`
Identifier, while the compiler may tolerate parser diagnostics elsewhere. It
is not evidence of full-compiler rejection or decorator execution.

For final publication preparation, Prettier changed only formatting in the
focused fixture; the final fixture SHA-256 is
`1f15d3e214bbd3701dc0bcbd9ab450d0a6afa64491129e9e95fdda79e5ce371f`.
The preceding terminal receipts retain their original fixture hash and are not
being relabeled as byte-identical final-fixture measurements.

**Step 6 — Clusters C, G, E (19) — as capacity allows.**
- C: pattern-param rehydration into the frame (`storeSpills`/#3386 seam in
  `generators-native.ts`; the `(#3386)` comment near the frame constructor
  marks the spot) + GetIterator-failure TypeError for the `iter-get-err`
  quartet (belongs with step 2a's runtime GetIterator).
- G: generator-expression name binding immutability/TypeError — same
  mechanism as #2037/#1049 (fn-name destructuring defaults), applied to
  generator expressions.
- E: `__call_fn_0/1` call_ref arity for rest-param generators (compare
  against a working non-generator rest-param lowering); `local.tee` type
  mismatch on `statements/generators/yield-star-before-newline.js`.

**What NOT to do:**
- No new host imports without a standalone fallback (dual-mode rule); the
  runner fails any module emitting `env::*` imports in standalone.
- Never edit `tests/test262-runner.ts`, skip lists, or
  `scripts/*baseline*.json` to make tests "pass".
- New type queries go through `ctx.oracle` (`src/checker/oracle.ts`), never
  raw `ctx.checker.*` (oracle-ratchet gate).
- Do not `--no-verify`; run the ratchet gates chained before every commit
  (CLAUDE.md "Hooks and ratchet gates").
- Do not re-implement what #1691 (yield* throw/return), #1344 (receiver
  brand checks), or #3236 (intrinsic chain) already have in flight — check
  their claims (`node scripts/claim-issue.mjs --check <id>`) before starting
  those slices.

## Acceptance criteria

- All tests in `.tmp/es2015/wp-generators-current-fails.txt` (166 paths) pass
  via `npx tsx .tmp/run-standalone.mts --list …`, EXCEPT the explicitly
  deferred set: 4 quickjs-env tests (H — environment, pass wherever the
  quickjs eval artifact is built) and 5 dynamic-GeneratorFunction tests
  (step 3 DEFER list). Partial waves are mergeable per-cluster; each PR
  states its cluster and measured delta.
- Every test in `.tmp/es2015/wp-generators-passing-spotcheck.txt` passes
  (40/40 — today 15/40 due to cluster B; this criterion is the regression
  guard and step 1 alone must restore it).
- Source-ratchet gates pass (`check-loc-budget`, `check-func-budget`,
  `check-coercion-sites`, `check:oracle-ratchet`, `check:dead-exports`),
  including against CI's merge-preview base (`LOC_GATE_BASE`).
- Equivalence tests pass (`npm test -- tests/equivalence.test.ts`), and
  `tests/issue-4768-generator-call-boundary.test.ts` stays green after the
  step-1 reshape.

## Results (wave 1, 2026-08-28)

Measured on this branch's base (`f30c595c`) with
`npx tsx .tmp/run-standalone.mts --list …`, Node 22.

| List | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| `wp-generators-current-fails.txt` (166) | 0 pass / 166 fail | **8 pass** / 158 fail |
| `wp-generators-passing-spotcheck.txt` (40) | 15 pass / 25 fail | **39 pass** / 1 fail |

The spotcheck's remaining failure is `yield-weak-binding.js`, which needs the
quickjs eval provider (`JS2WASM_EVAL_ENGINE=quickjs`, artifact not built in this
container) — an environment gap, identical before and after this change, and the
same class as the four cluster-H tests the acceptance criteria exclude.

The headline number is the spotcheck: cluster B was a live head regression that
broke EVERY native-generator first resume on Node 22, well beyond this package.
Its yield inside the 166-file list is small (+2) because those tests have
independent second failures, exactly as Plan step 0 predicted.

### Clusters fixed

- **B — resume-trap regression (+2 in list, +24 in spotcheck).**
  `ensureNativeGeneratorResumeFunction` no longer emits a **result-typed**
  `try_table` (V8 12.4 runs `try_table (ref null $result)` as `unreachable`).
  The trampoline keeps its value-producing shape inside a plain
  `block (result R)`, spills to `resultLocal`, and the empty-blocktype try
  scaffold — the shape every other standalone EH site uses — wraps that.
  Branch depths inside the trampoline are unchanged relative to the new inner
  block. #5060's §27.5.3.4 close-on-abrupt intent is preserved;
  `tests/issue-4768-generator-call-boundary.test.ts` stays 12/12 green.
- **D — `yield`-identifier early error (+4).** New
  `isInYieldParamContext` (`predicates.ts`) replaces both the
  `module-rules.ts` walk and the `node-checks.ts` `isInsideGeneratorFunction`
  call for the `yield`-as-identifier rule. It stops at the first non-arrow
  function boundary (a nested ordinary function resets `[Yield]`) and treats a
  function's own BindingIdentifier correctly: a FunctionExpression name is
  always `[~Yield]`, a FunctionDeclaration name inherits the enclosing context.
- **§27.3.4 non-constructor generators (+2).** `new g()` on a generator
  function — literal `function*(){}`, a name in `ctx.generatorFunctions`, or an
  identifier whose oracle-resolved variable initializer is a generator function
  expression — now throws TypeError instead of silently constructing.

### Clusters skipped (with the reason, for wave 2)

- **A1 `yield*` delegation (~35 of the 58 remaining #680 compile errors,
  the `star-rhs-iter-*` family).** NOT attempted in this pass. Widening the
  admission gate alone cannot land it: most of that family puts `yield*` inside
  a try-region, which hits the #3050 hard bail in `compileState`
  (`generators-native.ts` ~L843, `if (unwind.some((e) => e.kind !== "replay"))
  return fail()`), and the delegation protocol itself (`.throw()`/`.return()`
  forwarding, inner-result passthrough per §27.5.3.7) is not implemented. Wave 2
  must build the driver first and open the gate last — a gate opened early turns
  a clean #680 refusal into silent wrong codegen.
- **F1/F2/F3 generator object model (~38).** Needs a per-function `.prototype`
  slot and a real `%GeneratorFunction%` object; `.prototype` reads currently
  return the shared `%GeneratorPrototype%` intrinsic. Note for wave 2:
  `Object.getPrototypeOf(function*(){}).constructor` already resolves today, so
  the work is descriptor/identity correctness, not a from-scratch install.
- **G — fn-name binding semantics (5).** Named-function-expression name binding
  (strict reassignment → TypeError, sloppy → silently immutable). Not
  generator-specific; belongs with #2037/#1049 for all named function
  expressions.
- **C — dstr param rehydration / GetIterator-failure (≈11)** and **E —
  rest-param `__call_fn_*` arity (3)**: inside the #3386 frame seam; not
  attempted. The `iter-get-err-array-prototype` quartet in C is really
  general iterator-protocol fidelity (a deleted
  `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` must make destructuring throw), not a
  generator-local fix.
- **§27.5.3 "executing"-state TypeError (3, the `from-state-executing`
  trio).** Needs a re-entrancy flag in the generator frame set on resume entry
  and cleared at every return point; the state struct has no spare field and
  the return points are scattered across the trampoline arms. Deferred rather
  than done half-way.
- **H — quickjs env (4)** and the 5 dynamic-`GeneratorFunction` tests: excluded
  by the acceptance criteria.

Gates run bare (never piped) and green: `check-loc-budget`,
`check-func-budget`, `check-coercion-sites`, `check:oracle-ratchet`,
`check:dead-exports`. The `loc-budget-allow` / `func-budget-allow` lists above
were extended for the actual touched paths and functions.

Scoped vitest: the eight generator equivalence suites plus
`tests/issue-4768-generator-call-boundary.test.ts` and the three early-error
suites are green apart from failures verified pre-existing on clean `HEAD` by
reverting the five touched files and re-running the same file: one in
`tests/equivalence/yield-as-expression.test.ts` (a TS assignability error in
the fixture) and two in `tests/issue-3632-eval-early-errors.test.ts`
(runtime-eval provider). A full `tests/equivalence` run OOMs in this container
(known, CLAUDE.md); the three other failures it reported before dying
(`arguments-nested-and-loops`, `logical-conditional-identity` ×3) were checked
the same way and are likewise pre-existing.
