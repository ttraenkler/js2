# #472 -- Async/await support for test262 conformance

1,405 test262 tests are skipped because they use async functions or async iteration.

## Breakdown
- 1,311 tests skipped: "async flag" (test262 async harness)
- 94 tests skipped: "unsupported feature: async-iteration"

## Challenge
Wasm does not have native async/await. Options:

1. **CPS transform** -- convert async functions to continuation-passing style at compile time
2. **State machine transform** -- similar to how TypeScript downlevels async/await to ES5
3. **Wasm stack switching** (proposal) -- not yet widely available

## Minimum viable approach
- Transform async functions into state machines (like TS `--target ES5` does)
- Each `await` becomes a yield point in the state machine
- Promise wrapping at function boundaries
- Start with simple async/await (no async generators)

## Notes
- This is a large feature that may need to be broken into sub-issues
- Many async tests also depend on Promise support which is already partially implemented
- The test262 async harness uses `$DONE()` callback pattern
