# #1930 — TypeOracle: one type-query boundary

## Problem

There is no abstraction between the TypeScript checker and codegen:

- **~397 `getTypeAtLocation` call sites** across 20+ codegen files thread a
  live `ts.TypeChecker` and raw `ts.Type` objects everywhere. The only
  firewalls are the small `ValType` mapper (`checker/type-mapper.ts:38`) and
  the partial IR `TypeMap`.
- This **forecloses the project's own TS7 plan**: typescript-native-preview
  has no JS-API TypeChecker; the shim already throws under `--ts7`
  (`src/ts-api.ts:114-131`, #1029). Migration today would be a rewrite.
- Type knowledge is fragmented across **four** uncoordinated mechanisms: the
  TS checker, the IR lattice (`ir/propagate.ts:220`), `shape-inference.ts`,
  and import-resolver's syntactic `any` stubs.
- The `number|null` → bare `f64` lowering spawned ~300 lines of heuristics
  (`compiler.ts:98-391`) that *suppress the checker's own correct
  diagnostics*, recognizing only direct `!== null` if-guards — suppression
  is inconsistent, and `compiler.ts:387-390` reaches into the unsupported
  internal `isTypeAssignableTo` API.

## Proposed approach

Architect spec first; then mechanical migration:

1. Define `TypeOracle` — the closed set of queries codegen actually needs
   (survey the 397 sites; expect ~15 query kinds: valTypeOf(node),
   isNullable, callSignatureOf, elementTypeOf, propertyTypeOf, …) returning
   **compiler-owned types** (ValType/IrType-level), never `ts.Type`.
2. Implement `TsCheckerOracle` (today's behavior) behind it; migrate codegen
   sites file-by-file with a grep ratchet on `getTypeAtLocation`
   (same mechanics as the #1095 cast budget).
3. Fold nullable-primitive handling into the lowering (branded externref or
   (i32-flag, f64) pair — coordinate with #1852's per-backend value
   representation), then delete the suppression heuristics in
   `compiler.ts:98-391`.
4. Later backends: TS7 LSP-based oracle; IR TypeMap as a refinement layer.

## Acceptance criteria

- Ratchet file counts direct checker access in `src/codegen/`; CI fails on
  growth; trend to zero.
- The suppression-heuristic block is deleted; `number|null` programs compile
  with correct semantics (tests).
- A `--ts7` smoke path can construct the oracle without `createProgram`.

## Source

Compiler quality review 2026-06. Related: #1029 (TS7), #1852, #1948 (numeric
lattice consumes the oracle). Needs `/architect-spec`.

## Amendment (2026-06-11, analysis program)

Define a **thin first slice as the boxing prerequisite** (report 05 §5):
the value-representation work (#2072/#2080 P0, #2104 JsTag module) needs
only a small TypeOracle facade — ONE CodegenContext field exposing 3–4
queries (staticJsTypeOf(expr), isBooleanProducing(expr), union parts) —
not the full decomposition. CodegenContext is now measured at ~190 fields
/ 445 mutation sites (grown past the review's count); the full
decomposition is sprint-64+ scale and blocks nothing if the thin slice
lands first. Sequence: thin slice in sprint 62 alongside boxing P0; full
boundary later.
