# ES2015 standalone: string conformance wave 1

## 2026-09-20 anonymous-expando deletion follow-up constraints

The reader checkpoint is published separately as upstream PR 5991. Its frozen
30-path result is 29 pass, one failure; deletion/reassignment remains a distinct
follow-up in `codex/5152-anon-expando-delete-20260920`.

IR coordination reports no competing claim for the consumer-only bag-deletion
direction. The writer must prove exact receiver/shape admission, complete
physical-field inventory, and reservation/fill reachability in an
anonymous-expando-only module before adding the arm. Existing identity-keyed
bag presence authenticates a stored descriptor, not those other facts. Keep
closure/generator/vec/Error and retained-marker class routes first; no new
layout marker, late helper minting, or producer mutation is authorized.

Additional review finding: the dynamic reader's existing exposed-field loop
uses a truthiness check that omits an empty-string field name. The deletion
collision inventory must not copy that condition: distinguish `undefined`
from `""` and test an empty-name physical override alongside legal `$` and
`__` user keys. Otherwise deleting a bag override could resurrect a physical
value. Missing proof must decline rather than claim successful deletion.

Source qualification: `struct-field-exports.ts` assigns shape IDs only to
colliding anonymous groups with nonempty exposed-name inventories, not every
anonymous object. Its collector skips empty names; `coldOwnFieldsFor` also
filters empty and `$`/`__` names. Neither output alone proves a complete
physical collision inventory. An exact-stamp admission rule must demonstrate
that the original failing String.raw receiver is actually admitted; if not,
the writer needs a sound alternative using existing metadata rather than a
new marker or a silently inactive fix. Cold/split or canonical/subtype shapes
without complete proof must remain unhandled.

Exact-diff review identified two additional inventory hazards. The fnctor
field-name helper maps `$constructor` to `constructor` unconditionally, so an
anonymous user-recorded `$constructor` must retain its raw collision name.
Also, `literals.ts::_hasRuntimeComputedKey` admits well-known Symbol keys into
static layouts and `resolveComputedKeyExpression` spells them `@@name`.
Thus not every Symbol bag entry is necessarily a true expando: deleting an
overlay of a physical Symbol property can resurrect that property. Until
symbol-aware physical collision proof exists, decline anonymous candidates
with reserved `@@` physical names. Add separate physical Symbol.iterator and
string `"@@iterator"` controls; do not change literal producers to force them
through the new arm.

## 2026-09-19 original-row candidate checkpoint

The safe closed-struct reader candidate, with the unsound unconditional static
accessor fallback removed, was run on the three original String.raw failures
using Node 24 and the maintained standalone path runner with `--isolate`.
The writer worktree is `codex-5152-string-raw-audit-20260919`, based on
`4a6cbdf1ee80b5d1618a7c87b014bc792f0fddc7`, with uncommitted source changes.
The measured result is **1 pass / 2 failures**, not completion of this issue:

- `built-ins/String/raw/nextkey-is-symbol-throws.js`: pass.
- `built-ins/String/raw/template-length-throws.js`: expected exception absent.
- `built-ins/String/raw/returns-abrupt-from-next-key.js`: strict rerun fails
  with a read-only-property assignment TypeError.

Evidence: `/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-three-standalone-candidate-20260919.log`.
The corresponding import audit in
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-three-imports-20260919.log` reports `success: true`
and `imports: []` for all four primary/required-strict artifacts. Each audit
entry also reports `errors: 1`; severity must be inspected before describing
diagnostics as clean. The path runner's terminal exit status alone does not
establish a passing suite; the row counts above are authoritative for this run.

The pinned census used an older compiler (`a3943f63...`), so this checkpoint
does **not yet claim a same-base original-row gain**. The writer retains the
compiler lease briefly to check the original Symbol row on untouched
`4a6cbdf1...` with identical runner settings, then hands the lease to the
RegExp writer. The remaining static accessor cases need a successful,
per-instance definition record; compile-time accessor metadata is not proof
that an accessor was installed on a particular runtime object. The independent
peer is specifying that lifecycle before widening implementation ownership.

### 2026-09-20 admitted accessor-definition repair

Same-base follow-up: the original Symbol row fails on untouched compiler
`4a6cbdf1ee80b5d1618a7c87b014bc792f0fddc7` with the expected-TypeError-absent
assertion. Evidence is
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-symbol-baseline-4a6-20260920.log`, produced by the
adjacent `.mts` script calling authoritative `runTest262File` in a fresh
single-row process. The script imports the coordinator worktree compiler and
remaps missing worktree corpus reads to the shared pinned Test262 checkout;
this is an explicit harness-path adaptation, not a literal invocation of the
maintained `--isolate` command. Together with the candidate pass above it
supports one original-row fail-to-pass transition, subject to completion of
the remaining regression gates. Its separate compile audit succeeds with no
imports and one **warning** (`$DONOTEVALUATE` IR fallback/type-index parity),
not an error-free diagnostic list. The candidate severity audit in
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-symbol-candidate-errors-20260920.log` reports the
same warning with successful compilation and no imports. Both follow-up
processes exited zero; the writer explicitly released the compiler/test lease
to the RegExp writer and continues accessor-definition source work only.

The independent peer identified an existing identity-keyed carrier bag that
can hold the missing descriptor; no closure or carrier allocation ABI change
is needed. The writer is now authorized to extend only the standalone
anonymous-struct static inline accessor arm in `object-ops.ts`:

1. Preflight runtime helper availability and late import shifts before receiver
   emission. Keep the existing saved receiver; do not reevaluate its AST.
2. Build each getter/setter closure exactly once into fresh externref locals.
   Use those same closure objects for the bag and existing static globals.
3. Call existing `__defineProperty_accessor` with the saved receiver, key,
   closures, and descriptor flags. Check rejection, drop its retained result,
   and publish the globals only after successful definition.
4. Keep dynamic readers on the bag-first route with the original receiver.
   Do not reuse `emitExternDefinePropertyNoValue`, which would replay receiver,
   key, and closure evaluation in this arm.
5. Verify the original accessor rows, physical-field overrides, undefined
   accessor results, getter receiver identity, pre-definition/untaken-branch/
   same-shape isolation through String.raw, and rejected redefinitions. Keep
   zero-import validation and same-base regression comparisons.

The existing direct typed-property dispatch still consults per-shape globals
and compile-time accessor metadata. Its lifecycle defect is a separate
residual, not solved by this dynamic-reader repair; preserve tests/evidence
and do not advertise general Object.defineProperty conformance. Host lowering
and IR-owned closure/carrier allocation remain unchanged. Coordinate exact
`object-ops.ts` hunks with the concurrent RegExp intrinsic descriptor route.

Coordinator source review of the initial mirror found a required correction:
if `buildAccessorClosure` fails, installing null with the getter/setter-present
bit silently changes a supplied accessor into an absent function. Do not use
that fallback. Preflight support before emission or report a hard compilation
failure after emission; do not produce successful wrong semantics. Likewise,
the preflighted descriptor helper must not have a silent missing-target arm
that leaves its five arguments on the stack. These review findings were sent
to the writer before candidate testing; this mirror has no passing claim yet.

Corrected-mirror follow-up: fresh standalone `--isolate` execution of the
three original rows now reports **2 pass / 1 fail** in
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-three-mirror-20260920.log`. Both
`template-length-throws.js` and `nextkey-is-symbol-throws.js` pass;
`returns-abrupt-from-next-key.js` still fails its strict rerun with a read-only
assignment TypeError. The template-length row previously failed on the safe
reader-only candidate, so this records an additional measured transition in
that same-base candidate sequence, not a full-suite gain claim. The writer
corrected the silent closure/helper failure paths; the frozen 30-original
manifest is the next validation. Full regression/typecheck/publication gates
remain.

The frozen 30-original candidate run subsequently reported **29 pass / 1
fail**, with no skip/compile-error entries, in
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-string-raw-30-standalone-mirror-20260920.log`.
The run was independently confirmed live (runner PID 64055 with an isolated
child) before its buffered summary appeared; no duplicate was launched.
Compare against fresh same-base evidence before calling this a population
delta from the older pinned census. The one failing original defines a
configurable getter at raw index `0`, deletes that property, then assigns
`"a"`; the strict rerun reports generic read-only assignment refusal. The
next bounded diagnosis should observe the delete result and own descriptor
after deletion. Its presence in the older host census is not a completion
exemption. Broader reader/descriptor regression gates and publication remain.

Exact lifecycle diagnostic follow-up
(`/private/tmp/js2-5152-delete-lifecycle-exact-20260920.log`) compiles
successfully with `errors: []` and `imports: []`. Its result mask is **43**
in standalone versus **51** in direct Node: both catch the initial getter
throw (32), return true from delete (1), and report undefined from the
post-delete own-descriptor read (2). Standalone then catches assignment (8),
whereas direct Node completes it (16). These are assertion bits, not row
counts. This narrows the remaining defect to inconsistent post-delete
assignment behavior. Do not infer that bag storage was physically removed
solely from a descriptor API result; the emitted setter/refusal path still
needs identification before changing shared deletion/setter code. No such
source expansion has been authorized for this lane yet.

Emitted helper follow-up resolves assignment through `__extern_set_strict`
(151), `__reflect_set` (150), then `__extern_set` (149). The generated
`__carrier_bag_delete` (152) lacks an anonymous-instance lookup, while the
instance setter still consults its identity bag and refuses its getter-only
descriptor. Evidence:
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-delete-lifecycle-helper-map-v2-20260920.log`.
This supersedes the earlier suggestion of a purely static direct-setter defect;
the post-delete descriptor read alone did not prove that the bag was removed.

IR coordination identified a real shared-file owner: #5753 at
`cddba56b768f30eb5d9af29d2954dd69e2b534b5` adds class-only deletion with
retained suppression markers and locals 3/4/5. Preserve that entire protocol;
do not widen its class predicate or simply delete anonymous physical-field
overrides, which could resurrect physical data. No known anonymous-expando
implementation is owned there. A separate narrow true-expando plan must prove
identity lookup, receiver/key admission, physical-field collision handling,
and reservation/fill ordering before any deletion source release.

Follow-up deletion implementation plan (2026-09-20, source-reviewed only):

1. Finish and publish the frozen reader/mirror repair independently. Then
   claim a separate true-expando deletion slice; do not mutate the frozen
   candidate while its publication gates run.
2. At FINALIZE enumerate concrete allocated `__anon_` shapes. Match both Wasm
   type and logical collision stamp using the existing `buildShapeGuardedArm`
   contract; a type-only match is insufficient for canonicalized shapes.
3. Look up, never ensure, the receiver's existing closure bag. Retain the
   current -1/0/1 not-handled/refused/deleted protocol and ordinary `$Object`
   bag/type/own-entry checks. Delegate successful admission to the existing
   `__delete_property`, rather than duplicating configurable/count logic.
4. Screen physical-field collisions before delegation. Reuse
   `exposedClosedStructFieldName` for public field names, and compare the
   normalized stored own-entry key, avoiding another user-observable key
   conversion. A physical collision must remain unhandled in this slice:
   deleting its overlay alone can resurrect physical data. Uncertain shape
   metadata also remains unhandled, not claimed-success.
5. Append any required scratch locals after the actual existing local list;
   do not reserve fixed indices used by IR's class route. Preserve class
   predicates, arm order, retained-marker authentication/count repair, builtin
   function metadata precedence, and generator/vec/Error routes. No late
   helper/type/import minting or shared instruction-tree aliases.
6. Required controls: the exact original strict String.raw delete/reassign
   test; accessor/data true expandos; non-configurable sloppy false and strict
   TypeError; repeat deletion; missing bag; independent same-shaped objects;
   physical-field override non-resurrection; class retained-marker regression;
   function name/length and generator deletion controls. Compare candidate and
   untouched base using the same runner, then rerun all 30 String.raw originals.

The verified IR task confirms no active anonymous-expando writer or pending
fix to await. It requests fresh head comparison and narrow proposed hunks
before shared fill/local changes. This plan is not implementation approval or
runtime evidence; class and physical-field deletion semantics remain intact.

Fresh integration check: `git ls-remote` on the retained IR fork branch again
returned `cddba56b768f30eb5d9af29d2954dd69e2b534b5`. Inspection confirms its
`classArm` replaces `fn.locals` with bag plus class locals 3/4/5. Therefore
anonymous scratch allocation must occur **after** that replacement; simply
appending at the start of the fill would lose those locals during composition.
The narrow insertion/ordering plan has been sent to the verified IR task for
review. No shared source has been changed by this check.

IR composition review found no ownership conflict, with an additional
admission requirement: authenticate actual anonymous-literal provenance, not
the `__anon_` naming heuristic or structural type alone. The earlier plan's
shape enumeration is only a candidate list, not sufficient proof. Inspect
existing allocation/provenance records before choosing the guard; do not add
a context/literal recording field without coordinating those owned seams.
`isInternalStructFieldName` documents that literal insertion-order metadata
preserves legal `$`/`__`-prefixed user keys, so a collision filter must not
silently classify those as hidden fields. Validate the no-class/no-closure/
no-vec/no-Error demand case to prove helper reservation actually occurs.
Add accessor non-invocation and Symbol-versus-string key controls. This is
composition clearance, not approval of an unreviewed implementation.

Reservation/fill source audit: the current single-source pipeline stamps
shapes at `codegen/index.ts` before `fillObjVecReflectionHelpers`; the
multi-source pipeline has the same ordering. That reflection fill calls
`fillCarrierBagDelete`, so final logical shape stamps are available there.
`reserveCarrierBagDelete` is called while building object deletion, but its
carrier-demand predicate still needs the anonymous-only runtime control.
The existing `object-literal-carrier.ts` records AST-to-carrier provenance in a
private WeakMap, not an enumerable finalizer registry. The strict-method
allocation recorder deliberately excludes property-only literals, and the
insertion-order map is absent for empty literals. None can be silently
substituted for complete literal provenance. Any registry/API extension must
be explicitly scoped and coordinated; do not broaden a heuristic to hide a
missing proof.

IR review held the subsequent proposed marker-field/type-mutation design:
patching shared canonical layouts/all constructors would be a separate
representation and lifecycle change, not covered by deletion ownership.
No such implementation is released. The writer is instead auditing whether
existing per-instance descriptor/bag identity plus own-entry proof and
physical-key collision decline can safely support true-expando deletion
without literal-origin proof. Preserve all earlier class and carrier routes;
do not broaden global carrier predicates. This is an engineering review hold
on that design, not a goal-wide blocker or request for user permission.

Focused reader fixture follow-up reports **3/5 pass / 2 fail** in
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-readers-vitest-20260920.log`. Standalone full-mask,
direct Node, and the explicitly documented host deletion-refusal control pass.
The larger host accessor matrix and simple native-first positive fail. These
must be compared with untouched `4a6cbdf1...` under the same fixture/harness
before labeling them pre-existing or changing the tests. They are unresolved
validation findings, not successful host parity. This fixture result does not
alter the original 29/30 standalone row count.

Untouched-base fixture A/B completed at `4a6cbdf1...`, terminal exit 0,
recorded in `/private/tmp/js2-5152-reader-fixture-base-20260920.log`.
The host deletion-excluded matrix is 66528 on both base and candidate; its
earlier positive expectation was overbroad. Native-first is different:
base returns `"aXb"`, candidate returns `""` on the same simple positive,
which is a real regression. The standalone mask moves from 129478 on base
to 131071 on candidate; these remain assertion masks, not test counts.

The source mismatch is identified: `fillClosedStructExternGetArms` runs only
under `ctx.standalone`, but the new ordinary-reader redirect in
`fillExternArrayLikeStructArms` checked helper presence alone. Native-first
therefore redirected physical-field reads into a getter without matching
closed-field arms. Align the redirect's admission with its producer's
standalone condition, preserving the existing native-first physical reader.
The writer is authorized to make that narrow correction and rerun the gates;
do not count it fixed until the positive passes again.

After that correction, the exact fixture reports **4/5 pass**: native-first
again returns `"aXb"`; standalone, direct Node, and documented host deletion
refusal also pass. The only failure is the verified pre-existing host mask
expectation (66528 versus 131067), which has not yet been changed. Evidence:
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-readers-vitest-after-nativefirst-gate-20260920.log`.
TS7 also passed (the sibling
`js2-5152-typecheck-ts7-after-nativefirst-gate-20260920.log`). The test lease
was explicitly handed back to RegExp. The host assertion may be renamed and
documented as a known-base deficit regression snapshot at 66528, not described
as complete host parity. Full correct Node/standalone masks and the native-first
positive remain required; the original strict-rerun deletion failure stays open.

LOC-growth allowance rationale (2026-08-28): the clusters below add a runtime
@@protocol dispatch lane, a reflective `String.prototype[Symbol.iterator]`
member, normalize validation + normalization tables, astral case-mapping
tables, and Symbol-rejection arms to the runtime coercion walkers — all in the
files listed in `loc-budget-allow`. Measured growth is expected and granted
for this change-set. `src/codegen/case-tables.ts` is GENERATED
(`scripts/gen-case-tables.mjs`) and grows by the new astral run tables.

Additional allowance rationale (2026-09-20): the bounded standalone
`String.raw` repair adds ordinary closed-struct reader arms in
`object-runtime.ts`, extracts their common `ToLength` tail into
`object-runtime-enumeration.ts`, and mirrors a successfully installed anonymous
accessor into the already-existing identity bag in `object-ops.ts`. The three
files are already over the source-size threshold; the allowance is limited to
these measured, reviewed additions.

Function-growth allowance rationale (2026-09-20): the function gate measured
only the three owning functions beyond their current thresholds:
`compileObjectDefineProperty` (1581/1475),
`fillExternArrayLikeStructArms` (530/425), and
`fillClosedStructExternGetArms` (534/470). Their added code is respectively
the one-evaluation successful-accessor bag mirror, the standalone ordinary
array-like-reader routing, and the descriptor-first closed-struct reader plus
Symbol boxing. The allowance is restricted to those three measured functions;
it does not update the shared function baseline or grant unrelated growth.

## Problem

### Latest frozen reader checkpoint (2026-09-20)

The reader/mirror source checkpoint is committed locally as
`acbab40d50` (`fix(codegen): preserve closed-struct raw accessors`), with
Thomas as author and the Codex/Terra Max attribution trailers. Normal
pre-commit gates passed. Inspection of the commit object found no embedded
signature, despite an initial writer report calling it signed; signing config
queries on this host are unset. No signing bypass was observed. Correct the
report rather than asserting a signature that is absent. The verified 30-path
manifest is now committed in follow-up `e34ebcbb8e`; its committed bytes match
SHA-256 `d7d2c223fb766dcc9ed460d3c2ddad520195dfc007db6d3c4f575575ba3e3827`.
The branch diff contains exactly the three source files, focused test, issue,
and acceptance manifest. Published upstream as
https://github.com/loopdive/js2/pull/5991, open and non-draft, at verified
fork head `e34ebcbb8e1283eddf9f2cc0b91a55eccbbfd97e` on
`ttraenkler:codex/5152-string-raw-audit-20260919`, base `loopdive/js2:main`.
Normal push gates passed. The remote accepted the branch despite a later
local tracking update hitting an existing shared config lock; the lock was
preserved and the remote SHA verified. Published source stays frozen while
the follow-up deletion work gets a separate worktree. The independent
RegExp reviewer also owns initial PR shepherding; a BLOCKED merge-state
summary is not itself a diagnosed conflict or a claim of merge readiness.
The independent one-shot PR read confirms `mergeable: MERGEABLE`, checked CLA
and successful completed checks; smoke, quality, issue/linear tests and
equivalence shards were still running. No failed check or blocking review was
found. Keep the completed scoped fix non-draft; do not poll or manually enqueue.

Final focused reader fixture: **5/5 pass**, verified from
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-readers-vitest-final-20260920.log` (11.81s).
The host descriptor case is explicitly a known-base deficit snapshot, not a
claim of complete host conformance. The native-first positive control is green
after matching the ordinary-reader admission to the standalone getter producer.
The frozen original 30-path isolated standalone run remains **29 pass / 1 fail**,
verified from `/private/tmp/js2-5152-string-raw-30-final-20260920.log`.
The sole failure remains `built-ins/String/raw/returns-abrupt-from-next-key.js`,
whose strict rerun refuses assignment after anonymous bag deletion. That
unreleased carrier-deletion seam remains open and is not part of this reader
checkpoint. These are uncommitted candidate results, not landed census gains.

The writer retains the single compiler/hook lease for remaining validation and
normal publication gates. RegExp may edit its own isolated native flags getter
insertion, preserving this lane's user-declared bag prefix; it may not run
compiler jobs concurrently. No PR or completed-issue claim is implied here.

53 ES2015-bucket test262 tests under `built-ins/String/**` fail on the
standalone target (re-verified 2026-08-28 on head, branch
`claude/es2015-test262-standalone-9vij99`: all 53 from the day-old baseline
still fail — 52 FAIL + 1 COMPILE_ERROR, 0 already fixed). Eleven root causes
cover all 53; the top six cover 79%, the top seven 85%. The dominant gap — the
§21.1.3 @@match/@@search/@@split/@@replace runtime protocol (15 tests) — is
also what stands between the standalone string methods and any user code that
passes non-RegExp search values, so it feeds the broader 100%-ES2015
standalone goal beyond this file list.

**Target list**: `.tmp/es2015/wp-string-current-fails.txt` (53 paths,
regenerated 2026-08-28). Per-cluster lists:
`.tmp/es2015/str-cl-{A-search-value-protocol,B-normalize,C-symbol-iterator,D-indexof-toprimitive,E-astral-case,F-string-raw,G-isregexp-guard,H-codepointat,K-pad-symbol-fill,I-fromcodepoint-symbol,J-realm-deferred}.txt`
(verified: their union is exactly the 53-path target list).
Probe: `cd /home/user/js2 && npx tsx .tmp/run-standalone.mts --list <file>`.
Minimal repros from this analysis: `.tmp/probes5152/*.js` — run one via
`npx tsx .tmp/probe-one.mts /home/user/js2/.tmp/probes5152/<name>.js`.

## Current failure clusters

## Implementation Plan

Order is by count descending; each step is independently landable, so partial
completion maximizes yield. All work is standalone-lane (`noJsHost(ctx)` /
`ctx.standalone` gates); js-host mode is untouched. Constraints throughout:
**no new host imports** (a host import is acceptable only as a js-host-mode
fast path with a Wasm-native standalone fallback — none is needed here); all
type queries through `ctx.oracle` (`src/checker/oracle.ts`), never
`ctx.checker.getTypeAtLocation` (oracle-ratchet gate; `wellKnownSymbolMemberOf`
already exists on the oracle); **never** edit `tests/test262-runner.ts`, any
skip list, or `scripts/*baseline*.json`.

### Step A — runtime @@protocol dispatch for match/search/split/replace (15 tests)

1. In `src/codegen/string-search-value.ts`, add an `emitSearchValueProtocolDispatch`
   builder that emits, for a search value held in an externref temp `sv`:

   ```
   if (!nullish(sv)) {                                  // §21.1.3.x step 2/3
     m = __extern_get(sv, __box_symbol(<id>))           // getter RUNS; abrupt propagates
     if (!nullish(m)) {                                 // GetMethod: null/undefined ⇒ skip
       if (!IsCallable(m)) throw TypeError              // GetMethod step 3
       result = __call_fn_method_1(sv, m, S)            // match/search: Call(m, sv, «O»)
       // split/replace: __call_fn_method_2(sv, m, S, limit/replaceValue)
       return result (externref)
     }
   }
   // fall through to the existing ToString / RegExpCreate lanes
   ```

   Follow the exact GetMethod-read shape of
   `compileNativeDisposableStackUse` in `src/codegen/disposable-runtime.ts`
   (~L1160-1245): `ensureObjectRuntime` + `ensureLateImport("__box_symbol",…)`
   + `flushLateImportShifts` + the regime-independent `nullishOf` combinator.
   Well-known ids: match=7, replace=8, search=9, split=10
   (`src/codegen/literals.ts` L2508). Callable test: the same
   `__typeof_function`-style probe `ordinary-to-primitive-probe.ts` uses.
2. Wire it into the lanes that currently lose these tests:
   - `tryCompileStandaloneStringMatch` / `...Search` (regexp-standalone.ts)
     and `tryCompileCoercedStringMatch`/`...Search`
     (string-search-value.ts L244/L277): before falling into
     `RegExpCreate(ToString(v))`, emit the dispatch. This turns the runtime
     `REGEX_UNSUPPORTED_DYNAMIC_PATTERN` TypeError into a correct `Call`.
   - the `split` arm (`string-ops.ts` ~L3400) and
     `tryCompileStandaloneSplitSeparator` (string-search-value.ts L318):
     dispatch BEFORE `ToString(this)` — `split/this-value-tostring-error.js`
     observes that the receiver is NOT coerced when the separator has @@split.
   - `replace`: same, before the ToString lane; this also deletes the
     `replace/cstm-replace-get-err.js` refusal path (the L3652-3674 refusal in
     string-ops.ts no longer fires for symbol-protocol arg forms once the
     dispatch lane exists — narrow the `symbolProtocolArgForm` refusal
     accordingly rather than deleting the whole diagnostic).
3. Evaluation/coercion order fix in the split string lane (same functions):
   evaluate both argument EXPRESSIONS in source order into temps, then coerce
   `lim = ToUint32(limit)` BEFORE `R = ToString(separator)`
   (`split/limit-touint32-error.js`). `compileStringIntegerArg`
   (string-ops.ts L2356) is the ToInteger engine to reuse for the temp.
4. `invoke-builtin-match/search*`: these read
   `RegExp.prototype[Symbol.match/search]` reflectively — today that read
   returns `undefined` even though the RegExp glue declares `@@7`-`@@10`
   (`regexp-standalone.ts` L5149). Fix the `<Builtin>.prototype[Symbol.X]`
   element-access READ path (`src/codegen/property-access-dispatch.ts`, the
   `Symbol.*` key arm) to resolve through the registered native-proto member
   closures — the same fix Step C needs, do it once there. With the runtime
   dispatch of A.1 in place, `''.match(/./)` after
   `RegExp.prototype[Symbol.match] = fn` must call `fn`; keep the static
   fast path for modules that never install such a member by reusing the
   module-scan gate pattern of `moduleInstallsCallableHasInstance`
   (`src/codegen/native-ordinary-instanceof.ts` L156).
5. Edge cases: `cstm-*-is-null.js` fall through to
   `RegExpCreate(ToString(obj))` = pattern `"[object Object]"` — verify
   `__regex_compile_dynamic_simple` accepts a `[...]` character class; if it
   refuses, the two `is-null` tests keep failing — check first, and if so
   handle that pattern class in `ensureDynamicStandaloneRegExpCompiler`
   (regexp-standalone.ts). The dispatch must evaluate `sv` EXACTLY ONCE
   (`cstm-matcher-invocation.js` counts calls).

### Step B — normalize (10 tests; 7 without Unicode tables)

Current-main revalidation (2026-09-19): the pinned oracle-14 ES2015 selection
contains exactly **14 normalize rows: 11 pass / 3 fail**. The three failures
remain `return-normalized-string.js`,
`return-normalized-string-from-coerced-form.js`, and
`return-normalized-string-using-default-parameter.js`. At `4a6cbdf1ee80`,
`string-ops.ts` explicitly still returns the receiver unchanged after form
validation; no native normalization helper or generator exists in the checked
source. Thus Step B.3 remains real unimplemented normalization, not the
String.raw descriptor issue. Related #1541's proposed opt-in ICU provider is
historical design, not implemented support or sufficient acceptance for the
default standalone goal. No normalization implementation claim or test run
has been started in this continuation.

#### 2026-09-20 read-only triage — complete normalization wave (base `upstream` `200f7e2c8bc00dfb9a9c50dcc4b6570413f8a567`)

This is a source/standards audit only. It preserves the frozen oracle-14
receipt above (11 pass / 3 fail) and deliberately did not run a compiler,
Test262, or a data generator. The queued next receipt is the exact three
remaining originals plus the eleven passing normalize controls, after the
separate lanes explicitly release the serial compiler/test lease.

**Current-main baseline receipt (2026-09-20).** After checkpointing this plan
and merging `upstream/main` `62221769a87acdc32759c656702eede64936feb5` into
local merge head `c47fcc7c081accaea26dfe556e44999043acd43f`, the exact frozen
14-row manifest at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-paths-20260920.txt` (SHA-256
`027e4b21d7fd72e77e419c2bd758e30a9498b70eafd2aa344daef2c2856ec76e`) was
measured with `COMPILER_POOL_SIZE=1`, `JS2WASM_ROW_TIMEOUT_MS=120000`,
`VITEST_FORK_MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE=3072`, Node 24, and
`scripts/run-test262-paths.mts <manifest> --isolate --standalone`. The durable
terminal log is `/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-baseline-20260920.log`.
Its authoritative settled denominator is **14 = 11 pass + 3 fail**, with zero
skip/error rows. The wrapper itself exits zero after reporting verdicts, so
the counts—not that process status—are the receipt. The only non-passes are
`return-normalized-string.js` (NFD),
`return-normalized-string-from-coerced-form.js` (coerced NFC), and
`return-normalized-string-using-default-parameter.js` (default NFC). Their
Test262 assertions all observe the unchanged input rather than normalized
output, confirming the source diagnosis below; all eleven abrupt/type/name/
length preservation controls retain their baseline verdict.

The retained controls are `form-is-not-valid-throws.js`, `length.js`,
`name.js`, `normalize.js`, `not-a-constructor.js`,
`return-abrupt-from-form-as-symbol.js`, `return-abrupt-from-form.js`,
`return-abrupt-from-this-as-symbol.js`, `return-abrupt-from-this.js`,
`this-is-null-throws.js`, and `this-is-undefined-throws.js`. They are
preservation controls, not evidence that the three transform rows are solved.

**Verified current root cause.** `compileNativeStringMethodCall` in
`src/codegen/string-ops.ts` has a dedicated `method === "normalize"` arm. It
does receiver/form handling, but after validation leaves `recvLocal` on the
stack unchanged (or directly returns `emitReceiver()` for no argument). There
is no `__str_normalize` helper, no normalization-table module, and no
normalization data generator. This exactly explains all three remaining
return-value rows:

- `return-normalized-string.js` requires canonical decomposition, canonical
  ordering, NFC composition, and compatibility behavior across all four forms;
- `return-normalized-string-from-coerced-form.js` reaches the same transform
  after `['NFC']`/object-form coercion; and
- `return-normalized-string-using-default-parameter.js` requires the omitted
  and explicit-`undefined` default of NFC.

The older Step-B wording is now partly historical: current
`src/codegen/string-proto-tostring.ts` includes `normalize` in
`NO_ARG_STRING_MEMBER_HELPER`, mapped to `__str_flatten`, so the reflective
path has the receiver preamble but still returns the identity and has no slot
to read its optional form. `STRING_PROTO_METHOD_PARAM_SLOTS` in
`src/codegen/array-object-proto.ts` likewise has no `normalize` entry. A real
implementation must replace that no-argument shortcut rather than reuse it.
Also, the direct static-invalid-form shortcut currently throws before
`emitReceiver()`. The replacement must materialize/evaluate the receiver
first for every form spelling, then decide the form, preserving #1823 rather
than retaining that shortcut.

**Ownership and boundary.** This is a native-string/codegen task, not an IR
or carrier-layout task. A targeted implementation owns
`src/codegen/string-ops.ts`; a new lazy
`src/codegen/normalize-native.ts`; generated
`src/codegen/normalize-tables.ts`; and a new
`scripts/gen-normalize-tables.mjs`. The reflective optional-form glue needs a
narrow `array-object-proto.ts` dispatch/slot change and either a dedicated
`string-proto-normalize.ts` body or an equivalently isolated helper; it must
remove only the `normalize: "__str_flatten"` no-argument mapping from
`string-proto-tostring.ts`. No `src/ir/**` normalization opcode, frontend
lowering, object runtime, carrier bag, provenance, or layout change was found
or is needed. The native builder must use the existing append-only
`mintDefinedFunc`/`pushDefinedFunc`, late-import settlement, and
`nativeStrHelpers` index-shift discipline; it must add no host import.

**Pinned data contract, not sampled host ICU.** Follow the repository's
existing Unicode-17 contract in
`scripts/generate-regexp-string-properties.mjs`; do not silently move to
Unicode 18. The normalization generator should use versioned Unicode 17.0.0
UCD URLs, record a SHA-256 for every consumed source in both the generator's
expected-input manifest and the generated header, and reject a version/hash
mismatch. Required inputs are:

1. `UnicodeData.txt` for decomposition mappings and Canonical_Combining_Class;
2. `DerivedNormalizationProps.txt` for
   `Full_Composition_Exclusion=Yes`; and
3. `NormalizationTest.txt` as the pinned conformance corpus.

`CompositionExclusions.txt` alone is not enough: UAX #15 identifies
singletons and non-starter decompositions as exclusions too, while the full
derived property is the complete machine-readable set. The generator must
parse a tagged decomposition as compatibility-only and an untagged mapping as
canonical, recursively pre-expand canonical and compatibility mappings into
separate compact tables, omit surrogate code points, compress nonzero CCC
values, safely validate/expand `First`/`Last` UCD ranges rather than silently
discarding a range record, and build a sorted pairwise composition index from
canonical pairs only when the composite is not
`Full_Composition_Exclusion`. Algorithmic Hangul must remain code, not an
incomplete table. This is the
[UAX #15](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/) model: full decomposition,
canonical ordering, then canonical composition for C forms; its conformance
clause requires `NormalizationTest.txt`.

**2026-09-20 generated-data checkpoint (source-only; not a Wasm receipt).**
The local generator now pins and verifies the exact Unicode 17.0.0 source
bytes: `UnicodeData.txt`
`2e1efc1dcb59c575eedf5ccae60f95229f706ee6d031835247d843c11d96470c`,
`DerivedNormalizationProps.txt`
`71fd6a206a2c0cdd41feb6b7f656aa31091db45e9cedc926985d718397f9e488`, and
`NormalizationTest.txt`
`5019ffd530751a741900c849c0e010332f142a3612234639bd200b82138a87db`.
Its table-backed reference implementation consumes the exact serialized
key/offset/length/value and CCC/composition arrays that the native helper will
consume, and passed all 20,034 official rows without consulting host ICU. It
also asserts the Rule-2 data-side invariant: all generated singleton
transformation sources (including all 11,172 algorithmic Hangul syllables)
occur in the 17,086 Part-1 c1 scalars. This is a generator/data invariant,
not yet compiled-Wasm identity coverage for all other assigned scalars.

The original compatibility index triple encoding would have required one
17,742-element `array.new_fixed`, beyond the repository's 10,000-element
engine limit. The generated module instead serializes each decomposition index
as three parallel arrays (keys, offsets, lengths); the native binary search
returns the shared entry ordinal. The generator rejects any emitted fixed-array
slice above 10,000 and the current maximum is the 9,193-element compatibility
value slice. The native builder repeats that bound defensively. No compiler,
typecheck, or Wasm validation ran for this checkpoint; validating actual module
construction and imports remains a required lease-gated acceptance step.

**2026-09-20 conformance-fixture generation checkpoint (historical row-corpus
artifact; not a Wasm receipt).** The same local, hash-verified UCD inputs first
generated the test-only `tests/fixtures/normalize-ucd17-conformance.ts`
alongside the native table module. That predecessor was 2,265,243 bytes and
contained scalar-only row-major values, five-column offsets, original source
line numbers, and the Part-1 c1 scalar set; it deliberately contained neither
JavaScript strings nor host-normalized answers. Its payload SHA-256 was
`b23dbd3ce6245e1bc3fac3ea084091cc9250f760105223d9adb813c3c2857e49`, and its
source `NormalizationTest.txt` SHA-256 remains
`5019ffd530751a741900c849c0e010332f142a3612234639bd200b82138a87db`, and it
declares exactly 20,034 rows / 400,680 required relations. The future harness
recomputes that payload digest from the loaded arrays before compiling any
adapter, rather than trusting two duplicated header constants. This generated
test data needs a measured per-file size/ratchet allowance if repository gates
require one; no global budget or format rule may be weakened. The Rule-2
assigned-scalar inventory was deliberately a separately required generated
artifact, not inferred from this Part-1 data.

**2026-09-20 Rule-2 inventory source-only update (before emitted-Wasm run).** The pinned local
generator now also derives a compact, sorted inventory from *every*
`UnicodeData.txt` assignment after validating each `First`/`Last` record's
fields. It records **735** non-surrogate scalar ranges covering **297,334**
assigned scalars, including **137,468** `Co` private-use scalars; it separately
records all **2,048** `Cs` surrogate code points rather than silently treating
them as scalars. Every Part-1 c1 scalar is checked to lie in the emitted range
inventory, leaving **280,248** assigned non-surrogate Rule-2 identity inputs.
The regenerated 2,276,541-byte fixture authenticates that inventory in its
payload digest
`733ccbe5078c762ac50a176279f08219f8d1d110e991ccac5c2da4e517bb5833`.
A separate root read-only calculation over the pinned `UnicodeData.txt` range
endpoints independently matched the 297,334 / 137,468 / 2,048 inventory
counts without invoking the generator, compiler, or test runner.

The corresponding harness has two separately named gates on the one numeric
emitted-Wasm adapter: all 280,248 Part-1-absent
assigned scalars in NFC/NFD/NFKC/NFKD (**1,120,992** scalar identity
relations), and all 2,048 lone UTF-16 surrogate code units in those four forms
(**8,192** code-unit identity relations). The existing leading/trailing
surrogate barrier remains a distinct mixed-sequence control. This respects the
UAX #15 Rule-2 wording about assigned code points while stating the JavaScript
WTF-16 surrogate boundary with a separate denominator. The prior row-corpus
receipt below used the predecessor payload (`b23dbd…`) before this range
inventory was added; it remains historical evidence for the official rows. The
expanded-fixture terminal receipt immediately below supplies the required
Rule-2 and surrogate denominators.

**2026-09-20 first emitted-Wasm smoke (failed implementation checkpoint).**
The first leased Node-24 Vitest run of
`tests/issue-5152-normalize-native.test.ts` is retained at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-smoke-20260920.log` (terminal exit 1): its
host-preservation control passed, while the standalone compilation failed
before Wasm emission. A temporary, restored stack-only diagnostic captured
the DCE failure at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-smoke-stack-20260920.log`; a second restored
walker path diagnostic at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-smoke-arm-trace-20260920.log` identified an
undefined `if.then` in the native Hangul trailing-T branch. The builder had
emitted an `if` with an `else` but no required `then: Instr[]`, so dead-import
elimination attempted to walk `undefined`. `normalize-native.ts` now supplies
the semantically empty `then: []`. That source-only correction has not yet
been rerun. Therefore this checkpoint establishes neither standalone Wasm
construction nor any normalization result; the next leased smoke must rerun
the original direct/reflective and host controls before widening to Test262 or
the UCD corpus. A separate void-value boundary control covers a
direct form, reflective form, and direct surplus argument for both
`VoidExpression` and a real `(): void` call: each must preserve its effect and
pass canonical `undefined` to the optional form slot where applicable. This is
a narrow ABI control, not an additional Unicode-algorithm claim.

**2026-09-20 corrected emitted-Wasm smoke receipt.** The same focused Node-24
Vitest invocation then passed at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-smoke-rerun2-20260920.log` (terminal exit
0): one file and all three tests passed. The original standalone matrix
returned mask 31 for NFC, NFD Hangul, NFKC compatibility, omitted reflective
form, and explicit-null RangeError/`.length`, while asserting an empty Wasm
import section before instantiation. The separate void-value matrix returned
mask 63 for direct and reflective `VoidExpression` and real `(): void` form
calls plus the corresponding ignored surplus arguments. The existing reached
host control also passed. This establishes the initial emitted helper path and
the optional-form ABI boundary only; it is not a 14-row Test262 receipt or a
full Unicode-conformance claim.

**2026-09-20 frozen candidate Test262 receipt.** With production source held
at the exact seven-file SHA-256 manifest in
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-frozen14-candidate-20260920.txt` (worktree
HEAD `c47fcc7c081accaea26dfe556e44999043acd43f`, Node `v24.19.0`), the exact
same frozen-14 manifest/options as the baseline were rerun under
`COMPILER_POOL_SIZE=1`, `JS2WASM_ROW_TIMEOUT_MS=120000`,
`VITEST_FORK_MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE=3072`, Node 24, and
`scripts/run-test262-paths.mts <manifest> --isolate --standalone`. The durable
log `/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-frozen14-candidate-20260920.log` is
terminal (runner session 68778, exit 0) and reports **14 pass / 0 non-pass**;
there are no skip or error rows. Thus all eleven frozen validation/preservation
controls remain passing and all three baseline transformation rows now pass:
the exact manifest moves **11 pass / 3 fail → 14 pass / 0 fail**.
The runner's exit alone is not the claim; its settled 14-row denominator and
per-row non-pass section are. This is a bounded Test262 gain receipt, not yet
the UCD corpus or Rule-2 Wasm conformance gate.

**2026-09-20 shared-call-seam preservation A/B.** While the seven normalize
production files were frozen at the manifest above, the root lane ran the
shared String parameter-slot/reflective seam controls in this worktree and a
pristine `62221769` matched-base worktree. Both terminal runs were exactly
**23 pass / 5 fail / 28 settled**: all five transferred-prototype controls
passed, 18 of 23 search controls passed, and the identical five historical
reflective `includes`/`startsWith`/`endsWith` cases threw
`WebAssembly.Exception` in both candidates. The test source hashes were held
equal (`b27dc5f1…efd040` and `d3714591…7948d`), and the seven frozen normalize
production hashes matched. This is no observed regression in the 28 controls,
not a claim that all 28 pass; the root owns the detailed durable A/B logs.

**2026-09-20 emitted-Wasm UCD row-corpus receipt (historical predecessor;
Rule 2 then pending).**
The seven production-file hashes were compared against the frozen-14 manifest
immediately before this run and matched exactly. The small numeric adapter
control at `/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-ucd17-adapter-control-20260920.log`
is terminal (Node 24 direct Vitest, exit 0, one selected pass / one filtered):
it proves native-string global mutation, numeric `String.fromCharCode` ingress,
numeric output reads, a retained unpaired-surrogate barrier, and a real empty
`WebAssembly.Module.imports(module)` section. It is a prerequisite control, not
the corpus claim.

The full adapter receipt at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-ucd17-corpus-20260920.log` is also terminal
(exit 0, one selected pass / one filtered; 1.692 seconds test time). It
compiled and instantiated exactly one standalone adapter and asserted
`imports=[]` before instantiation. Before compilation the harness recomputed
SHA-256 `b23dbd3ce6245e1bc3fac3ea084091cc9250f760105223d9adb813c3c2857e49`
from the *loaded* scalar/offset/line/Part-1 arrays, checked their 20,034-row
shape, and pinned the official source SHA-256
`5019ffd530751a741900c849c0e010332f142a3612234639bd200b82138a87db`.
It then executed all **400,680** official relationships (20 per row: the full
NFC/NFD/NFKC/NFKD five-column relation set) through numeric UTF-16 ingress and
egress. There is no host `String.prototype.normalize()`/ICU comparison in this
harness. This is positive compiled-Wasm coverage of every official row. At
this predecessor checkpoint, the separate assigned-scalar Rule-2 identity
inventory/test was still pending; the expanded receipt follows.

**2026-09-20 expanded emitted-Wasm UCD receipt (Rules 1/2 plus JavaScript
surrogate boundary).** With the same frozen seven production hashes (verified
unchanged against `/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-frozen14-candidate-20260920.txt`),
the expanded test file is terminal at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-ucd17-rule2-20260920.log`: Node 24 direct
Vitest exit 0, **1 test file / 4 tests passed**, 3.676 seconds test time
(15.21 seconds total process duration). It compiled one full numeric UCD
adapter and one small ingress prerequisite adapter; each construction asserted
an empty `WebAssembly.Module.imports(module)` section before instantiation.
The loaded fixture recomputed payload SHA-256
`733ccbe5078c762ac50a176279f08219f8d1d110e991ccac5c2da4e517bb5833`,
including its assignment inventory, before compilation.

The terminal denominator is deliberately split rather than folded into a
sampled mask: **400,680** official five-column `NormalizationTest.txt`
relationships over 20,034 rows; **1,120,992** Rule-2 scalar identities
(280,248 Part-1-absent assigned non-surrogate scalars × four forms); and
**8,192** lone-surrogate UTF-16 code-unit identities (2,048 × four forms), in
addition to the explicit mixed surrogate-barrier adapter control. All numeric
UTF-16 ingress/egress comparisons are made by the harness; no host ICU or
`String.prototype.normalize()` result is consulted. This closes the planned
official-row/Rule-2 corpus acceptance for the pinned Unicode-17 data and
states the separate JavaScript surrogate boundary explicitly; it does not
erase the remaining ordinary project gates below.

**2026-09-20 deterministic fixture-layout correction (source-only; runtime
receipts above remain historical).** Biome skips a source file at its 1 MiB
limit, so the expanded 2,276,541-byte single fixture could not be called
lint-covered merely because the repository-wide lint command exited zero while
its unrelated diagnostics were capped. The pinned generator now deterministically
emits a wrapper plus four fixed contiguous scalar-value modules instead of a
single oversized values declaration. The public wrapper API and loaded payload
remain unchanged: its payload digest is still
`733ccbe5078c762ac50a176279f08219f8d1d110e991ccac5c2da4e517bb5833`, and
the wrapper reassembles all four chunks in order before the existing harness
hashes it.

The generated module sizes are all strictly below the 1,048,576-byte limit:
the wrapper is **1,021,416** bytes and the `values-0` through `values-3`
modules are respectively **322,453**, **333,739**, **319,086**, and
**282,119** bytes (2,278,813 bytes total). The generator checks this bound
before writing any generated fixture file, verifies each nonempty chunk and
their aggregate scalar count, and uses a fixed four-way floor-partition so
output does not depend on host formatting. It emits `prettier-ignore` only on
generator-owned numeric arrays; no global formatter or Biome configuration was
weakened.

Two back-to-back generation runs against the same pinned UCD input produced
identical SHA-256 manifests at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-generator-split-before-20260920.sha256` and
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-generator-split-after-20260920.sha256`.
The generated table remained
`c9394e157b7402928a7f27eaaa4fc17a9b217268eb6b3b84e47e5bb1d8dfeeff`; the
five fixture-module hashes are recorded in the latter manifest. Targeted
Biome lint over the wrapper and all four chunks is terminal with **5 checked,
zero errors** at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-ucd17-fixture-biome-20260920.log`; a targeted
Prettier check over the generator, normalize sources/tests, wrapper, and all
chunks is terminal at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-prettier-split-20260920.log`. The full
repository lint command still reports a capped set of unrelated diagnostics,
so its exit status is not cited as proof of fixture coverage. No compiler,
Wasm, or Test262 process ran for this layout correction. Consequently the
earlier Test262, smoke, TS7, and UCD receipts must be rerun against this exact
generated fixture topology before a final current-tree claim.

**2026-09-20 static normal-gate checkpoint (no compiler/test lease used).**
Against explicit current main
`LOC_GATE_BASE=62221769a87acdc32759c656702eede64936feb5`, the LOC and
function-budget gates are terminal clean over all seven changed codegen files
at `/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-loc-budget-after-allow-20260920.log` and
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-func-budget-after-allow-20260920.log`.
The issue-scoped grants are intentionally exact: generated
`normalize-tables.ts` is **3,644** LOC of pinned UCD data, while the one
`ensureStrNormalize` builder is **852** LOC because its one emitted Wasm
function shares 39 local slots, table globals, and late-resolved helper
indices. Their frontmatter rationale records why a cosmetic TypeScript split
would add index/stack-order risk without reducing the emitted helper. No
baseline file or global ceiling was changed.

The static coercion and oracle ratchets pass with no net growth, and issue
spec coverage, issue-ID uniqueness against main, done-status integrity,
`update-issues --check`, and the IR retirement ledger all exit zero (durable
logs use the `js2-5152-normalize-*-20260920.log` prefix). Full source/test/
script Prettier verification is terminal at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-format-check-split-retry-20260920.log`.
The dead-export command itself exits zero but is deliberately **not** called a
retirement certification: its pre-existing whole-repository modeled-closure
report remains open on nonliteral imports at `src/optimize.ts:394` and
`src/runtime/platform-capability-adapter.ts:151`, matching the independently
paired baseline finding. This slice does not touch either path.

**2026-09-20 Unicode License V3 provenance correction (comment-only data
refresh; final runtime revalidation terminal).** The pinned `NormalizationTest.txt`
header identifies Unicode, Inc. and points to the Unicode terms page; the
[official terms](https://www.unicode.org/copyright.html) identify files under
`https://www.unicode.org/Public/` as Unicode Data Files and subject them to
Unicode License V3. Its [license text](https://www.unicode.org/license.txt)
requires the copyright and permission notice to accompany copies or associated
documentation. The prior generated data headers named the sources and hashes
but carried only the project Apache header, so the generator now documents
that its own implementation remains Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception while it
emits the complete Unicode License V3 copyright/permission notice into every
generated derivative-data file: `normalize-tables.ts`, the UCD fixture wrapper,
and all four value chunks. No implementation source was relabeled and the
repository-wide license was not changed.

This header-only refresh retains the same pinned sources, table values,
fixture API, and payload SHA-256
`733ccbe5078c762ac50a176279f08219f8d1d110e991ccac5c2da4e517bb5833`
(20,034 rows, 100,171 offsets, 205,047 scalar values, and 280,248 Rule-2
scalars), verified by importing the rebuilt wrapper in plain Node without a
compiler/test harness. Two regeneration passes are byte-identical at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-unicode-notice-{before,after}-20260920.sha256`.
The full notices keep every fixture module below Biome's limit: wrapper
**1,023,187** bytes; chunks **324,224**, **335,510**, **320,857**, and
**283,890** bytes. Targeted Biome (five generated fixture modules) and
Prettier (generator, tables, wrapper, chunks) both pass at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-ucd17-fixture-biome-notice-20260920.log` and
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-prettier-unicode-notice-20260920.log`.

The post-split UCD 4/4, frozen-14 14/0, smoke 3/3, and TS7 receipts preceding
this paragraph remain historical behavior evidence, not byte-identical
source-hash receipts after this required comment/provenance refresh. The
refreshed candidate is frozen in
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-unicode-notice-candidate-20260920.sha256`.
With that candidate held unchanged, final Node-24 receipts are terminal:
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-ucd17-unicode-notice-20260920.log` reports
**4/4** tests passing for the import-free adapter, all **400,680** official
row relations, **1,120,992** Rule-2 identities, and **8,192** lone-surrogate
identities; the exact frozen Test262 manifest is **14 pass / 0 non-pass** at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-frozen14-unicode-notice-20260920.log`; the
focused direct/reflective smoke is **3/3** at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-smoke-unicode-notice-20260920.log`; and
direct TS7 exits zero with no diagnostics at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-ts7-unicode-notice-20260920.log`. The
comment-only refresh also reran explicit-main LOC/function budgets successfully
(`normalize-tables.ts` is now measured at 3,644 LOC under its exact issue
grant). This establishes the current source/data receipt; normal commit and
pre-push gates still require authorized publication and must not be bypassed.

**Remaining normalize-slice gates.** The deterministic UCD generation, numeric
adapter, frozen 14, and expanded UCD corpus receipts above must be repeated if
production source changes. Before a completed-fix publication claim, rerun the
existing direct/reflective smoke file after any production edit; then run direct
TS7 over the current generated fixture and harness, the focused Vitest files,
`git diff --check`, and unchanged normal
pre-commit/pre-push gates (lint/format, LOC/function ratchets, oracle/coercion
ratchets, numeric-local parity, and issue integrity). The 2.26 MB generated
fixture is now represented by five deterministically generated modules below
Biome's file-size limit; retain their explicit lint coverage and do not add a
global exception, baseline change, or gate weakening.

**Native helper design.** `ensureStrNormalize(ctx)` should be demand-driven
from the direct and reflective call sites, after `ensureNativeStringHelpers`,
so modules that merely use another string method do not retain the Unicode
tables. It should install `__str_normalize(s, formMode) -> ref $AnyString` and
immutable generated-table globals via `array.new_fixed`, as the case-mapping
helper does. A correct first implementation is intentionally table-driven,
without an unsafe quick-check fast path:

1. Flatten the WTF-16 `NativeString`, decode valid surrogate pairs to scalar
   values, and preserve each unpaired surrogate unchanged as a CCC-0 barrier.
2. Append the selected pre-expanded canonical (NFD/NFC) or compatibility
   (NFKD/NFKC) decomposition to a growable mutable i32 scalar buffer. Handle
   Hangul syllable decomposition algorithmically.
3. Perform stable canonical ordering within each starter-delimited run using
   the CCC table. The buffer must grow geometrically with `array.new_default`
   plus `array.copy`, following the existing string/vec builders; no fixed
   maximum expansion or bounded combining-mark stack is sound.
4. For NFC/NFKC, run UAX #15 canonical composition with its blocking rule,
   the generated pair index and algorithmic Hangul L/V/T composition. NFD and
   NFKD stop after ordering.
5. Compute the exact UTF-16 output length, allocate the native i16 backing
   array once, encode scalars (including preserved unpaired units), and return
   a new flat native string. The output must not be an alias/identity shortcut
   merely because the input happens to contain non-ASCII text.

The shared call-site form routine should produce a small mode enum only after
the receiver is evaluated. It must default only absent or `undefined` form to
NFC (including the standalone undefined singleton), coerce every other form
once with the existing ToString/Symbol path, reject `null` as the string
`"null"`, and throw the existing RangeError for values outside the four exact
names. The reflective body needs one physical optional argument slot while
leaving `.length === 0`; it must use the same routine and helper after
RequireObjectCoercible/ToString(this), rather than make a separate identity
path.

**Validation required before a future implementation claim.** In addition to
the frozen 14 Test262 rows (all 11 current passes retained and all three
original failures green), add a focused native test that checks all four forms,
default/explicit undefined, coercion and Symbol/RangeError/evaluation-order
semantics, canonical ordering and blocking, composition exclusions (including
U+0344/U+0958/U+2126), compatibility mappings, Hangul, astral pairs, and
unpaired-surrogate preservation. It must assert a standalone module has no
imports. Vendor or generate a hash-pinned Unicode-17
`NormalizationTest.txt` fixture and execute every official row through the
compiled native helper in bounded chunks; this is a positive conformance gate,
not a host-ICU comparison or a three-example fixture. Keep js-host behavior
unchanged and record any size/ratchet budget for generated data explicitly.

**2026-09-20 emitted-Wasm acceptance design and execution status.** The
generator/data receipt alone is deliberately insufficient: it validates a
JavaScript reference over the serialized tables, not the generated Wasm helper.
The frozen-14 and expanded UCD adapter receipts above have executed this
design against one frozen production candidate, recording its `HEAD`, relevant
hash manifest, Node-24 path, and terminal logs. The design has two independent
parts:

1. **Exact Test262 retention and gain.** Re-run exactly
   `/private/tmp/js2-5152-normalize-paths-20260920.txt` (SHA-256
   `027e4b21d7fd72e77e419c2bd758e30a9498b70eafd2aa344daef2c2856ec76e`) with
   `COMPILER_POOL_SIZE=1`, `JS2WASM_ROW_TIMEOUT_MS=120000`,
   `VITEST_FORK_MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE=3072`, the installed Node 24, and
   `scripts/run-test262-paths.mts <manifest> --isolate --standalone`. Treat
   the settled per-row verdicts as authoritative rather than the wrapper's
   zero exit: require denominator 14, zero skip/error rows, all eleven
   retained controls still passing, and the three named transform rows changing
   from the baseline's fail to pass. This run is intentionally separate from
   Unicode conformance and must retain the baseline's isolated runner/options.

2. **One compiled numeric UCD adapter, not 20,034 compiled AST fixtures.**
   Extend the pinned Unicode-17 generator to emit a committed test-only
   `NormalizationTest.txt` payload: version/source hashes, exact row count,
   a digest of its serialized payload, and compact flattened scalar sequences
   with offsets for all five columns. The Vitest harness must verify those
   metadata/digest values before testing; it must neither fetch UCD data nor
   call host `String.prototype.normalize()`/ICU as an oracle. First add a tiny
   standalone adapter-control that proves this compiler supports mutating a
   module-global native string via numeric exports and that its real Wasm
   import section is empty. The full adapter is then compiled and instantiated
   exactly once. It exposes only numeric boundary methods such as
   `resetInput()`, `appendUnit(unit)`, `run(mode)`, `outputLength()`, and
   `outputUnit(index)`; `appendUnit` builds the input with native
   `String.fromCharCode`, and `run(0..3)` selects the four literal forms
   NFC/NFD/NFKC/NFKD. The host harness encodes each pinned scalar sequence to
   UTF-16 units itself, feeds and reads units numerically, and compares numeric
   units itself. No host string bridge or host normalization result is allowed.

   The single instance must check all UAX #15 `NormalizationTest.txt`
   relationships, not merely one preferred source column: NFC c1/c2/c3 → c2
   and c4/c5 → c4; NFD c1/c2/c3 → c3 and c4/c5 → c5; NFKC every c1–c5 → c4;
   NFKD every c1–c5 → c5. That is 20 relations per row, or 400,680 normalizer
   invocations for the pinned 20,034-row corpus. Chunks may bound host-loop
   progress and make the first failing row/form/column durable, but they may
   not recompile a module per row or substitute sampled fixtures. Assert
   `WebAssembly.Module.imports(new WebAssembly.Module(binary))` is exactly
   empty before instantiation and report the corpus digest/row denominator.

   UAX #15 Rule 2 also requires identity in every form for assigned scalars not
   listed in NormalizationTest Part 1. The data-side Part-1 coverage invariant
   is useful but not a Wasm proof. The generator now emits a reproducible,
   validated `UnicodeData.txt` assignment inventory after First/Last expansion;
   the terminal same-adapter gate exercised all 280,248 Part-1-absent scalars
   in all four forms against their own UTF-16 encodings. A separately named
   all-2,048-code-unit surrogate lane and the existing mixed barrier control
   cover the JavaScript WTF-16 boundary. Their separate terminal denominators
   are recorded above rather than silently folded into the row corpus.

This plan rejects both a three-character patch and an unpinned
`String.prototype.normalize()`-as-generator oracle. The separate #1541
ICU4X/opt-in side-module idea remains an alternative product decision, not a
substitute for the default standalone Unicode-17 conformance implementation
described here.

1. Rewrite the `normalize` arm in `src/codegen/string-ops.ts` L3563-3598:
   receiver first (keep the #1823 ordering), then if a form arg is present and
   not a statically-valid literal: coerce via `emitArgAsNativeString`
   (string-ops.ts L463 — its Symbol guard covers
   `return-abrupt-from-form-as-symbol.js`, its walker propagates the abrupt
   `toString` of `return-abrupt-from-form.js`), then a runtime 4-way string
   compare (NFC/NFD/NFKC/NFKD) → `RangeError` via the same
   `buildThrowJsErrorInstrs` used elsewhere (`form-is-not-valid-throws.js`;
   note `['NFC']` coerces to `"NFC"` and is VALID —
   `return-normalized-string-from-coerced-form.js`).
2. Reflective arm: add a `normalize` member body in
   `src/codegen/array-object-proto.ts` (the String glue dispatcher, ~L1000-1100)
   that runs `emitStringRequireObjectCoercible` (L937) + `ToString(this)`
   (Symbol receiver → TypeError — `return-abrupt-from-this-as-symbol.js`) +
   the same form validation. Mimic `emitStringSearchNumericMemberBody`
   (L1270+) for the closure ABI. Covers the four `this-*`/`return-abrupt-from-this*` tests.
3. Actual normalization (3 `return-normalized-string*` tests) — the largest
   sub-step, land LAST and defer to a wave 2 if it does not fit. The 2026-09-20
   audit above supersedes this item's earlier Node-ICU/probe sketch: use pinned
   Unicode-17 UCD data, full decomposition/CCC/composition-exclusion semantics,
   Hangul code, and the official `NormalizationTest.txt` corpus rather than
   sampled host normalization. Implement it through
   `scripts/gen-normalize-tables.mjs`, generated `normalize-tables.ts`, and
   `__str_normalize` in `src/codegen/normalize-native.ts`, with immutable
   module globals via `array.new_fixed`.

### Step C — `String.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` (5 tests, unblocks A.4)

1. Add `"@@1"` to the String glue member CSV in
   `src/codegen/array-object-proto.ts` (Array's glue already carries `"@@1"`
   at L111 as a `values` alias — same sentinel format; RegExp's `@@7`-`@@10`
   at regexp-standalone.ts L5149 show the multi-symbol form). Member kind:
   method, `length` 0, name `"[Symbol.iterator]"`, non-constructor (the
   native-proto closure factory's default — `not-a-constructor.js`),
   prop-desc writable+configurable, non-enumerable.
2. Member body: `RequireObjectCoercible` + `ToString(this)` (abrupt for a
   poisoned-toString receiver — `this-val-to-str-err.js`), then return the
   string iterator. Reuse the #3146 string-subject normalization
   (`ensureStrToCharVecHelper` + the per-code-point iteration
   `src/codegen/iterator-native.ts` L1392 already uses for dynamic
   GetIterator over strings) so `[Symbol.iterator]().next()` agrees with
   for-of.
3. Fix the reflective read: probe `q5-iter-indirect.js` currently produces
   INVALID WASM ("expected i32, got externref" in `__module_init`) when
   `String.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` is stored to a variable — the
   `<Builtin>.prototype[Symbol.X]` element-access read in
   `src/codegen/property-access-dispatch.ts` must route through the glue's
   member-closure factory (i32 well-known-symbol id vs externref key
   confusion). This same fix makes `RegExp.prototype[Symbol.search]` readable
   (Step A.4). Regression-check `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` reads.

### Step D — ToPrimitive sub-steps in string-method arg coercion (5 tests)

1. Literal `[Symbol.toPrimitive]`: make an object literal carrying a computed
   well-known-symbol key compile to the OPEN `$Object` representation (or
   teach the closed-struct coercion path to probe the `@@toPrimitive` field)
   so the #5102 probe in `src/codegen/object-runtime.ts` (L4793-5012, keyed
   `__box_symbol(3)`) finds it. Literal lowering: `src/codegen/literals.ts`.
   Verify with probes `q1-wrapped-literal-toprim.js` (ToString hint) — the
   number-hint twin is the first assertion of
   `indexOf/position-tointeger-toprimitive.js`.
2. Symbol rejection in the runtime walkers: add a `$Symbol`-carrier arm that
   throws TypeError to (a) the ToNumber walk used by
   `coerceType(…, f64, "number")` for externref operands, and (b) a
   throw-on-Symbol variant of `__extern_toString` for METHOD-ARG coercion
   (`ensureObjectRuntime`, object-runtime.ts; carrier type from
   `ensureSymbolCarrier`, `src/codegen/symbol-native.ts` L66). Do NOT change
   `String(sym)` — §22.1.1.1 allows it; only the implicit §7.1.17 ToString and
   §7.1.3 ToNumber paths throw. This also covers the `Object(Symbol())`
   wrapper unbox (the `WRAPPER_PRIMITIVE_KEY` read in `__to_primitive`
   returns the carrier; the walker must then reject it — probe
   `q4-boxed-symbol-throws.js`) and feeds Steps F and I.

### Step E — astral case mapping (4 tests)

1. `scripts/gen-case-tables.mjs`: extend `simplePairs` to scan
   `0x10000..0x10FFFF` into separate `ASTRAL_UPPER_CASE_RUNS`/
   `ASTRAL_LOWER_CASE_RUNS` (all astral mappings are simple 1:1 and stay
   astral, so UTF-16 length never changes — assert that in the generator).
   Regenerate `src/codegen/case-tables.ts` and commit.
2. `src/codegen/case-convert-native.ts`: in the full (non-ASCII) path, on a
   high surrogate followed by a low surrogate, decode the code point, look up
   the astral runs via the existing `__case_simple` binary search, re-encode
   the mapped pair. Pass-1 length counting is unaffected (pairs contribute 2
   before and after). `toLocale{Lower,Upper}Case` route to the same helpers
   (string-ops.ts L3273) so all 4 tests move together.

### 2026-09-19 Step F read-only revalidation plan

The pinned oracle-14 standalone baseline at baselines commit
`6c51eb29ef12208ac8f53ae99eea900b53f51a76` still fails all three Step F
originals: `template-length-throws`, `returns-abrupt-from-next-key`, and
`nextkey-is-symbol-throws`. Current source is upstream
`4a6cbdf1ee80b5d1618a7c87b014bc792f0fddc7`.

Before implementation, audit the current template handoff to `__str_raw` and
identify the narrowest identity-preserving representation already supported
by ordinary reads. Do not repeat the historical diagnosis as current proof.
Read exact originals and trace descriptor lookup, segment coercion, and their
error order. Produce a bounded source-level correction plan with required
before/after controls, or identify an exact shared-owner dependency.

The parent issue is reserved without a live owner. Open #5748 changes Boolean
result annotations in `call-builtin-static.ts`; #5736 removes its old generator
prototype special case. Their inspected hunks do not change `String.raw`,
but both must be preserved. Generic literals, closure/class representation,
and runtime lifetime/layout owners remain reserved by the IR task. This
assignment is read-only: no production edits, test execution, claim takeover,
or publication until source ownership and the implementation plan are agreed.

### 2026-09-19 Step F audit outcome and corrected implementation boundary

Read-only Terra audit at `4a6cbdf1ee80` revises the historical diagnosis below:
the outer template materialization preserves the original nested `raw` struct
reference. Do not patch that materializer or introduce a raw-copy workaround.
`string-raw.ts` already performs raw/length/index reads in the right order and
contains a Symbol TypeError guard. The shared dynamic readers lose the values
before that guard can act.

The runtime `Object.defineProperty` path stores closed-struct descriptors in an
identity-keyed carrier bag (`user-declared-structs.ts`, `carrier-bag-define.ts`).
The later emitted-code audit below found that the statically typed accessor
path bypasses this runtime storage; the initial audit did not distinguish it.
In `object-runtime.ts`, `fillExternArrayLikeStructArms` instead reads physical
length/numeric fields: missing physical length returns zero without consulting
the bag; accessor-only numeric entries are missed. Both its index boxer and
`fillClosedStructExternGetArms` number-box non-boolean i32 fields, including
symbol-branded fields. The named reader also puts physical field arms before
the bag arm, so switching callers to it alone leaves descriptor precedence
wrong. These are source-level findings, not a new compiler run; confirm the
original Symbol field's emitted brand in permitted IR evidence before repair.

Revised implementation plan, pending shared-owner agreement:

1. In `fillClosedStructExternGetArms`, make present carrier-bag descriptors
   override physical closed fields and box symbol-branded i32 through the
   existing `__box_symbol` path. Preserve boolean/number distinctions.
2. In `fillExternArrayLikeStructArms`, route closed-struct length and index
   reads through ordinary property semantics before ToLength/coercion,
   preserving getter exceptions and Symbol identity. Reuse the existing
   Get/ToLength construction in `object-runtime-enumeration.ts` as appropriate;
   coordinate that file if edits prove necessary. Audit `__extern_has_idx`
   consistency rather than accidentally making descriptor visibility differ.
3. Prove the three exact originals plus the existing `tests/issue-3147.test.ts`
   and `issue-4397-native-semantic-js-host.test.ts` controls in both lanes.
   Add a getter redefining an existing physical `length`/`"0"` field so a
   bag-only fix cannot hide incorrect precedence. Retain abrupt ordering,
   deletion/reassignment/redefinition, nullish/empty-length, substitution, and
   zero-host-import controls.

No production edits, compiler runs, claims, or commits were made by the audit.
The coordinator has requested the exact reader/enumeration ownership from the
IR task before dispatch. The historical Step F materialization remedy below
is superseded for these three originals by this audit, not silently adopted.

Dispatch release: the IR owner explicitly cleared the two reader functions
and `object-runtime-enumeration.ts`, including checks against retained and
unpublished IR trees. Preserve adjacent #5753 tuple-reader import/splice and
unpublished wrapper-allocation ownership. Complete open-PR hunk locations also
show #5784 changes wrapper/enumeration-sort/vector/hole/for-in functions and
#5397 changes Reflect.set/set-vector functions, not these two reader owners.
The atomic upstream claim `5152:closed-struct-raw-readers` is verified for
`ttraenkler/codex-5152-raw-readers`, branch
`codex/5152-string-raw-audit-20260919`. The Terra auditor now implements in its
own existing worktree. Compiler/test execution waits for the RegExp lane's
lease handoff; preserve an untouched-base red run before candidate green.
Independent peer review and full scoped gates remain required before a PR.

The fixed acceptance manifest is
`plan/agent-context/5152-string-raw-es2015-paths-20260919.txt`: exactly 30
unique ES2015 String.raw paths in the pinned oracle-14 baseline, all verified
present in corpus `b363f29d3c43c626dc852744ad64a0b48a003693`. Baseline statuses
are **27 pass / 3 fail**. SHA-256:
`d7d2c223fb766dcc9ed460d3c2ddad520195dfc007db6d3c4f575575ba3e3827`.
Paths are relative to `test262/test` (no `test/` prefix), as required by
`run-test262-paths.mts`. The initial baseline-style prefix was corrected
before execution, without changing the selected tests.
Use this unchanged in fresh isolated standalone and host acceptance runs after
the focused controls; original successes must not regress. Corpus preparation
does not constitute a test execution or candidate pass claim.
The helper's terminal exit code alone is insufficient: inspect all 30 row
verdicts and require no skipped/missing/error rows, because it reports counts
without setting a failing exit code for non-pass rows. Use `--isolate` in both
lanes to prevent shared-intrinsic contamination.

Portable fixture peer review confirmed the zero-import assertion and physical
field/accessor collision shapes. Before the first red run, replace catch-any
success counters with exact per-getter Error sentinel identity; retain the
length-order marker and require replacement-key coercion before the second
index getter (`"01"`) in the delete/reassign/redefine case. Add full compiled-host
matrix parity, not just the native-first positive smoke. A Symbol error
must be a TypeError, but its message must not be standardized by the test.
RegExp explicitly released the compiler lease with no live process; this lane
now has permission for the focused untouched-base red run and initial repair
checkpoint. No result from that run is claimed yet.

Subsequent writer-reported untouched-source result: standalone returns
**454 / expected 2047** in the tightened portable matrix. Present bits are
2, 4, 64, 128, and 256; missing bits cover descriptor-only length, physical
field overrides, getter receiver identity, present-undefined precedence, and
Symbol rejection. Production diff was empty for this run. The full compiled-host
matrix instead hits the delete/reassignment sidecar error before its
final assertions. Preserve that failing sequence; separately named portable
host subsets must not be presented as full-matrix parity.

Independent coordinator reconciliation of the same 30 originals against the
host JSONL at pinned baseline `6c51eb29ef12208ac8f53ae99eea900b53f51a76`
finds **28 pass / 2 fail**, oracle 14, `linked-harness`, 30 unique rows.
`template-length-throws.js` reports no expected exception;
`returns-abrupt-from-next-key.js` reports the strict-rerun getter-only
reassignment failure seen in the portable control. The Symbol original
passes host. These are existing host nonpasses, not candidate regressions or
authorization to edit the host sidecar in this bounded reader repair.

First candidate checkpoint is still red: writer reports standalone mask
**998 / expected 2047**, versus untouched-base 454. The added passing bits
are Symbol rejection (32) and original getter receiver (512), not a Test262
pass-rate claim. Descriptor-only length, physical-field descriptor precedence,
and present-undefined controls still fail. The writer is inspecting emitted
dispatch/type admission before further changes, within the same reader scope;
no broad run or original-row gain is claimed. Exact terminal/log metadata is
requested for the durable implementation record.

Review guard for the next candidate: its proposed `classAccessorSet` /
`staticAccessorByField` fallback must not treat compile-time registration as
runtime descriptor presence. Before accepting it, prove reads before a
definition, untaken definition branches, and another same-shape instance retain
their actual properties. Shape stamps are sufficient only if emitted runtime
transitions prove that distinction. The writer is holding that fallback while
the independent peer checks the exact registration/storage seam; if a missing
per-instance definition route is the cause, coordinate that source owner
rather than broadening static metadata into descriptor truth. This is an
open review concern, not a verified passing implementation.

The subsequent independent audit confirms that concern. In
`compileObjectDefineProperty`, the static accessor path adds
`ctx.classAccessorSet` while generating code, synthesizes accessor functions,
then returns the receiver without invoking the runtime define helper or writing
a per-instance descriptor presence record. S5C's optional closure global is
per shape/key, not per receiver, and later definitions overwrite it. `$shape`
is an immutable layout-collision discriminator, not a runtime mutation stamp.
Neither can safely prove descriptor presence before definition, in an untaken
branch, or on another same-shape object. The writer removed the unproven
fallback entirely, leaving the bag/ordinary-reader and Symbol changes.

This revises the initial reader-only diagnosis for the remaining accessor
controls: they require an identity-keyed runtime definition record at the
successful define site, then ordinary reads of that record. Coordinate the
exact `object-ops.ts` static-accessor seam before any expansion; the RegExp
writer owns a separate intrinsic-specific route in that file, and closure/
carrier allocation remains reserved by IR. Temporal/per-instance controls
and the exact three original standalone rows are the next bounded evidence;
no widening or new original gain is claimed before those results.

Expanded safe-candidate portable run (Node 24), inspected coordinator log
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-readers-standalone-candidate-20260919.log`:
one selected standalone test failed; two host controls were unselected by the
filter (reported skipped), not run. Writer reports terminal exit 1. The mask
is **130022 / expected 131071**, missing exactly bits 1, 8, 16, and 1024:
descriptor-only length, the two physical-field overrides, and present
undefined. New temporal/per-instance controls pass, but emitted routing may
select already bag-backed cases; this does not refute the confirmed static
definition-site gap or justify reinstating static metadata dispatch.
### Published reader checkpoint evidence retained from PR #5991

The following publication record is retained alongside the earlier diagnostic
history above. PR #5991 is now merged into upstream `main` at `d5e58586d1`;
the remaining deletion follow-up is not part of that landed reader fix.

Use this unchanged in fresh isolated standalone and host acceptance runs after
the focused controls; original successes must not regress. Corpus preparation
does not constitute a test execution or candidate pass claim.

### 2026-09-19 closed-struct raw-reader implementation evidence and remaining owner seam

The reader slice now makes the ordinary-read boundary explicit, but it is not
yet a complete fix for every statically lowered `Object.defineProperty`
accessor. The implemented reader-side changes are deliberately bounded to the
cleared ownership:

1. `fillClosedStructExternGetArms` checks a user-instance carrier bag by
   *presence* before any physical field arm, then uses
   `__reflect_get_receiver(bag, key, originalReceiver)`. This preserves
   descriptor precedence, makes a present `undefined` distinguishable from a
   miss, and gives a getter its original raw object as `this`.
2. `fillExternArrayLikeStructArms` sends user-declared closed structs through
   ordinary `__extern_get` / `number_toString` / `__extern_has` for length,
   indexed Get, and indexed Has. Its common `ToLength` tail lives in
   `object-runtime-enumeration.ts`, so the old `$Object` arm and the new closed
   receiver arm share coercion and clamping exactly.
3. Closed i32 values branded as Symbol are boxed through `__box_symbol`, not
   `__box_number`, before `String.raw` performs its existing ToString guard.

The focused fixture `tests/issue-5152-raw-readers.test.ts` adds exact-sentinel
controls for getter abrupt completion and order, physical-field overrides,
receiver identity, present-`undefined`, and static-metadata safety:
pre-definition, untaken/taken branch, and two same-shape instances. On the
safe bag-backed candidate the latter six temporal/per-instance controls pass;
the complete standalone result is `130022 / 131071`, with exactly bits
`1 + 8 + 16 + 1024` still absent. This is useful negative evidence: the reader
correctly handles descriptors that reach the bag, but does not fabricate a
descriptor from static metadata.

The exact remaining source dependency is the static accessor branch in
`src/codegen/object-ops.ts` (current lines 1760-2096). It executes
`ctx.classAccessorSet.add(accessorKey)` at lines 1777-1778, where `accessorKey`
is the compile-time `${structName}_${propName}` name,
synthesizes a bare `${structName}_get/set_${propName}` function, and returns
the receiver without an identity-keyed descriptor/bag write. `classAccessorSet`
is a compile-time `Set` created in `src/codegen/context/create-context.ts`, and
the optional S5C globals are keyed only by `(structName, propName)`; neither is
runtime proof that this object was defined, that a branch was taken, or that a
same-shape peer object owns the descriptor. `$shape` is immutable layout
identity, not a definition epoch. A reader fallback based on any of those
metadata carriers is therefore unsound and was intentionally removed.

The required shared-owner repair is narrow: on a *successful runtime*
definition through that static accessor branch, populate the existing
per-receiver descriptor/bag substrate observed by `__carrier_bag_has` /
`__carrier_bag_of`; do not copy the raw object or turn struct/key metadata into
descriptor truth. The existing runtime accessor applier path in
`emitExternDefinePropertyNoValue` (`object-ops.ts` from line 3019) and
`carrier-bag-define.ts` is the relevant established mechanism. Its owner must
preserve one-time receiver/key/descriptor evaluation, descriptor transition
validation, and direct static-access behavior while making the successful
definition observable to dynamic reads. This plan slice does not edit
`object-ops.ts`, runtime sidecars, or storage machinery.

### 2026-09-20 authorized static-accessor mirror plan

The reader-only boundary above is now extended by a single coordinated source
slice in `src/codegen/object-ops.ts`, limited to the standalone `__anon_*`
static-inline accessor branch (the branch that currently starts near line
1760). Before emitting the receiver body, call `ensureObjectRuntime`, reserve
the existing `__defineProperty_accessor` target, and flush late-import shifts.
Retain the already evaluated `objLocal`; materialize the literal key and each
getter/setter closure exactly once into externref locals. Call the existing
accessor applier with that saved receiver, key, closures, and the established
accessor flag encoding (including Get/Set-present bits 8/9); on its successful
result, drop the applier result and then publish those *same* closure locals to
the legacy per-struct globals.

This preserves receiver/key/closure single evaluation and lets the existing
carrier-bag define arm establish per-instance runtime presence. It must not
call `emitExternDefinePropertyNoValue`, because that helper recompiles those
operands. It does not add a carrier, sidecar, closure ABI, `String.raw`, or
reader fallback. The mirror's runtime branch is explicitly standalone-only;
the measured JS-host descriptor snapshot remains 66528, but no byte-for-byte
host-output comparison is claimed. Direct typed
property reads still rely on pre-existing compile-time
`classAccessorSet`/per-shape globals and are explicitly out of this slice's
lifecycle guarantee; only dynamic reads such as `String.raw` are claimed.

Fresh Node 24, standalone, isolated original-row evidence on the safe reader
candidate (all artifacts have an empty Wasm import list):

- `built-ins/String/raw/nextkey-is-symbol-throws.js` — **pass**.
- `built-ins/String/raw/template-length-throws.js` — **fail**: expected the
  Test262Error accessor throw, but no exception occurred.
- `built-ins/String/raw/returns-abrupt-from-next-key.js` — **fail** on the
  strict rerun: `TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property`.

The isolated runner output is retained at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-three-standalone-candidate-20260919.log`; the
primary/strict compiler import audit is retained at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-three-imports-20260919.log` and reports `imports: []`
for all four emitted variants. This is a real Symbol original-row gain only,
not a three-row or 30-path pass-rate claim. The known compiled-host baseline
remains 28 pass / 2 non-pass across the 30-path manifest; it was not rewritten
or represented as parity by this reader slice.

Same-base safeguard: a fresh Node 24 one-row `runTest262File` execution using
the untouched `4a6cbdf1` coordinator compiler source returns **fail** for
`nextkey-is-symbol-throws.js` (the expected TypeError is not thrown), with
`success: true`, `imports: []`, and one diagnostic. The coordinator worktree
has no populated corpus checkout, so the temporary audit launcher remapped only
its `test262/` *readFileSync* corpus reads to the pinned shared corpus; compiler
and test-runner modules themselves remained the untouched coordinator source.
This is a fresh authoritative one-row runner invocation, not a claim that a
literal maintained `--isolate` command was run from that unpopulated checkout.
The exact diagnostic is a **warning**:
`IR path failed for $DONOTEVALUATE: function typeIdx parity mismatch: IR=132,
legacy=50 — keeping legacy body [IR-FALLBACK]`. The current candidate's exact
Symbol assembly likewise reports `success: true`, `imports: []`, and the same
single warning. Therefore the evidence establishes a same-base Symbol verdict
delta but makes no diagnostics-clean claim. Durable logs are
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-symbol-baseline-4a6-20260920.log` and
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-symbol-candidate-errors-20260920.log`.

### 2026-09-20 frozen reader/mirror checkpoint, validation boundary, and residual

The source candidate is now deliberately frozen outside gate-fixes. It has four
cooperating, standalone-only pieces:

1. `fillClosedStructExternGetArms` consults a live carrier-bag descriptor by
   presence before a physical field, calls `__reflect_get_receiver` with the
   original receiver, and boxes a symbol-branded i32 with `__box_symbol`.
2. `fillExternArrayLikeStructArms` routes admitted user shapes' length/index/
   has-index operations through ordinary `__extern_get`, `number_toString`, and
   `__extern_has`; `buildArrayLikeToLengthFromExternref` is the common ToLength
   tail shared with the `$Object` arm.
3. The static inline accessor path mirrors only a successful standalone
   `__anon_*` definition into the existing identity bag. It evaluates receiver,
   key, and closures once; rejects an unliftable supplied getter/setter rather
   than storing null; applies `__defineProperty_accessor`; and only then
   publishes the legacy globals. No raw-object copy, static metadata fallback,
   carrier allocation, or JS-host change is involved.
4. The ordinary array-like routing is gated by `ctx.standalone`. This restores
   native-first's pre-existing physical-reader boundary: an initial ungated
   candidate returned `""` for the native-first `String.raw({raw:{length:2,
   0:"a",1:"b"}}, "X")` control; the corrected route returns `"aXb"`.

Measured candidate evidence (Node 24, fresh isolated standalone runs) is:

- exact three originals: **2 pass / 1 fail** — `template-length-throws` and
  `nextkey-is-symbol-throws` pass; only the delete/reassignment half of
  `returns-abrupt-from-next-key` fails;
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-three-final-20260920.log`.
- immutable 30-path manifest: **29 pass / 1 fail / 0 skip**, with that same
  one original remaining;
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-string-raw-30-final-20260920.log`.
- the standalone fixture's complete ordinary-reader mask is **131071**, and
  all generated artifacts in this lane have `imports: []`.
- the direct Node oracle also returns **131071**. The untouched-`4a6` A/B
  launcher records the historical standalone mask **129478**, direct Node
  **131071**, host full-source strict-setter throw, host delete-excluded mask
  **66528**, and native-first `"aXb"` at
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-reader-fixture-base-20260920.log`.

The fixture's JS-host case is intentionally a **baseline snapshot**, not a
positive compatibility or parity claim. For the source with the known
delete/reassignment sequence excluded, untouched `4a6` produces **66528**;
the asserted missing descriptor bits are
`1/2/8/16/1024/2048/4096/8192/16384/32768`. The full host source still throws
the pre-existing strict setter error. The focused run after the native-first
gate was 4/5 solely because this case still expected the standalone mask;
`tests/issue-5152-raw-readers.test.ts` now asserts the documented 66528
baseline. Its final direct run is **5/5** at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-readers-vitest-after-coercion-local-20260920.log`.
It must never be reported as full host parity.

The final direct TS7 invocation against the shared installed dependencies
passed: `/private/tmp/js2-5152-typecheck-ts7-final-20260920.log`.
The package script itself cannot resolve this isolated worktree's absent local
`node_modules`; that is a worktree provisioning limitation, not a TS result.

#### Remaining original: anonymous bag deletion, not a reader regression

The last standalone original is a shared delete/set residual. A targeted
diagnostic gives compiled standalone **43** versus direct Node **51**:
the first accessor throw and `delete` result are observed, but the subsequent
assignment is refused. The durable helper map is
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-delete-lifecycle-helper-map-v2-20260920.log`.

Source/WAT attribution is exact:

- `typeof-delete.ts` sends `delete obj.raw["0"]` to `__delete_property`.
- `__carrier_bag_delete` is reached, but its finalizer currently has closure,
  generator, vec, and Error lookup arms only. It has no anonymous-instance
  arm, returns `-1`, and `__delete_property` takes its historical non-object
  `return 1` fallback without removing the bag accessor.
- The later strict assignment follows `assignment.ts` →
  `__extern_set_strict` → `__reflect_set` → `__extern_set`; the still-live
  getter-only bag entry produces the shared refusal result and the observed
  TypeError. `object-runtime-strict-set.ts` is only the correct consumer of
  that refusal and is not an edit target.

No deletion code is included in this reader/mirror checkpoint. A separately
owned true-expando follow-up may need `carrier-bag-delete.ts` **and an
explicitly coordinated provenance-registry/API seam**; neither file set nor
implementation is authorized by this checkpoint. Its source-reviewed plan is:

1. Publish this frozen reader/mirror repair first. Then authenticate actual
   anonymous-*literal* provenance; neither the `__anon_` naming convention nor
   a structural type/shape match is proof that a receiver is eligible. The
   existing `object-literal-carrier.ts` AST-to-carrier private `WeakMap`,
   strict-method allocation recorder, and insertion-order map are not a
   complete enumerable finalizer registry (the latter two omit property-only
   or empty literals). They must not be silently substituted for that proof or
   widened without coordinated ownership.
2. Only after an authenticated registry design exists, enumerate its concrete
   allocated candidates at FINALIZE and match both Wasm type and logical
   collision stamp through `buildShapeGuardedArm`; type-only matching is
   insufficient for canonicalized shapes. The existing pipeline stamps shapes
   before `fillCarrierBagDelete`, but a candidate list alone remains
   insufficient admission evidence.
3. Look up, never ensure, the receiver's existing closure bag. Retain the
   current `-1/0/1` not-handled/refused/deleted protocol and delegate a
   successful admission to existing `__delete_property`, rather than copying
   configurable/count logic or widening `IS_INSTANCE_EXPANDO_CARRIER`.
4. Before delegation, compare the normalized stored own-entry key after
   `__obj_find` against the receiver's exposed physical fields using
   `exposedClosedStructFieldName`; do not re-coerce a user-observable key or
   use value-undefined as absence. `isInternalStructFieldName` metadata must
   preserve legal `$`/`__` user keys. A physical collision deliberately remains
   unhandled: deleting its overlay could resurrect stale physical data.
5. Preserve #5753's class arm, arm order, retained-marker authentication/count
   repair, builtin function metadata precedence, and generator/vec/Error
   routes. That arm replaces `fn.locals` with its own bag plus locals 3/4/5,
   so any anonymous scratch locals must be appended after that actual
   replacement. Do not mint late helpers/types/imports or share instruction
   trees across arms; prove the no-class/no-closure/no-vec/no-Error demand case
   still reserves the helper when an authenticated anonymous candidate exists.
6. Required follow-up controls include the exact configurable-accessor
   delete/reassign original; accessor and data true expandos; non-configurable
   sloppy false and strict TypeError; repeat delete; missing bag; independent
   same-shaped objects; physical-override non-resurrection; class retained
   marker; function name/length and generator routes; accessor non-invocation;
   and Symbol-versus-string keys. Compare against untouched base with the same
   runner, then rerun all 30 String.raw originals.

The verified IR task confirms no active anonymous-expando writer or pending
fix to await. This is a handoff specification, not runtime proof or deletion
implementation approval; `object-runtime.ts`, `typeof-delete.ts`,
`object-runtime-strict-set.ts`, class tombstones, and the generic instance
classifier remain out of the follow-up until an authenticated registry design
is independently owned and reviewed.

#### 2026-09-20 provenance-marker proposal — held by IR; do not implement

**Status (2026-09-20).** IR explicitly put the marker/layout direction on hold.
The proposal below is retained as historical investigation, not an approved
implementation plan: do not add a registry, marker field, ABI receipt, finalizer,
or allocation patch walk from it. In particular, a FINALIZE-time candidate cannot
be used to reserve `__carrier_bag_delete` after `__delete_property` has already
baked its optional call. The existing side-bag route is audited separately below.

The existing `object-literal-carrier.ts` map is useful evidence but cannot be
the deletion admission itself: it is a private, non-enumerable
`WeakMap<ObjectLiteralExpression, typeIdx>`, populated by
`compileObjectLiteralForStruct`. It has no finalizer snapshot, and
`compileWidenedEmptyObject` emits its own closed `struct.new` without using it.
Even an iterable copy of that map would prove only that *some* literal used a
canonical type. It would not distinguish a later copied/manual/nonliteral
allocation of the same Wasm type. The existing strict-method recorder shows the
same constraint explicitly: its IR token is construction-site provenance, but
it deliberately ignores property-only literals and thus cannot be repurposed
as this registry.

Historical fail-closed seam (rejected for this follow-up; retained for the
provenance constraint it established):

1. `object-literal-carrier.ts` owns a per-`CodegenContext` allocation registry,
   held in module-private `WeakMap`s rather than a new shared context field.
   `recordClosedObjectLiteralAllocation(ctx, structNew, literal, typeIdx)` puts
   a primitive `objectLiteralAllocationToken` on the actual `struct.new` and
   records its exact literal/type pair. The companion
   `requestClosedObjectLiteralDeleteProvenance(ctx, typeIdx)` is demand-only;
   it records a type requested by the already-existing standalone anonymous
   accessor-mirror path, not a claim that every instance of that type is a
   literal.
2. `literals.ts` is the only producer integration: call that recorder from
   `pushStrictMethodLiteralAllocation` for every
   `compileObjectLiteralForStruct` allocation, and from
   `compileWidenedEmptyObject` immediately before its direct `struct.new`.
   The latter is required for empty/property-only widened literals. Open
   `$Object` literals, host/accessor literals, and any construction path that
   does not carry this exact token stay unadmitted.
3. `object-ops.ts` adds only one demand registration, inside the existing
   successful standalone anonymous accessor-mirror branch, after its resolved
   `structTypeIdx` is available. It must not broaden that branch, use an
   `__anon_` name as runtime proof, or change receiver/closure evaluation.
   At finalization the request is intersected with actual recorded literal
   allocations; a requested type with no such allocation produces no marker,
   no delete arm, and no new behavior.
4. `object-literal-carrier.ts` also owns
   `finalizeClosedObjectLiteralDeleteProvenance(ctx)` and its immutable
   `closedObjectLiteralDeleteCandidates(ctx)` snapshot. For each demanded type
   with an exact recorded allocation, finalization appends a compiler-private
   immutable i32 marker field and patches every `struct.new` of that augmented
   type: only an instruction whose token resolves to the same literal *and*
   type receives its nonzero marker; all other allocations receive zero. The
   marker field index is held in a private side table, never rediscovered by a
   `$`/`__` name, because those are legal user keys. The patch walk must cover
   functions, globals, nested instruction arrays, and retained inline bodies;
   shallow IR clones preserve the primitive token exactly as the existing
   strict-method mechanism requires.
5. `index.ts` owns only the two pipeline placements. Invoke this finalizer
   after `resolveAndRecordShapeStamping` (so its candidate snapshot can carry
   the final logical shape guard) and before the first
   `fillObjVecReflectionHelpers`/`fillCarrierBagDelete` consumer in both the
   single-source and multi-source finalization pipelines. It must not mint late
   helpers, imports, or types. The marker is appended after any existing shape
   stamp; the snapshot records the authoritative marker field index plus the
   existing shape id/index.
6. `carrier-bag-delete.ts` is a consumer only. It receives the immutable
   candidate snapshot and adds a lookup-only arm guarded by exact Wasm type,
   final logical shape (`buildShapeGuardedArm`), and nonzero provenance marker
   before calling the existing `__closure_bag_lookup`. It retains the current
   `-1/0/1` protocol and delegates deletion to `__delete_property`. Before
   delegation, it obtains the existing entry via `__obj_find` and compares that
   stored normalized key against the candidate's exposed physical fields via
   `exposedClosedStructFieldName`/`isInternalStructFieldName` and the existing
   flattened native-string equality path. A physical collision remains
   **not handled**; no key is re-coerced and no `undefined` value is used as an
   absence test. Any missing provenance, marker, bag, entry, or shape metadata
   also remains `-1`.

This historical design correctly identified that type-only provenance is not an
allocation proof, but it does **not** authorize a type-name or type-only fallback.
It is superseded for this slice by the receiver-identity-bag audit below. No
source or test execution has been performed for the held design.

#### 2026-09-20 existing identity-bag audit — marker-free anonymous delete arm

The current runtime already has a per-receiver authentication fact that the
marker proposal did not use. In standalone/WASI, `ensureObjectRuntime` first
reserves `__closure_bag_lookup` / `__closure_bag_ensure`, then carrier visibility,
class tombstones, and instance props; only later does it construct
`__delete_property`, whose `reserveCarrierBagDelete` call bakes the optional
carrier-delete call. Thus the needed lookup and delete slots are already stable
before the caller body exists; no late demand, import, helper, or ABI-layout
mutation is needed.

`__closure_bag_ensure` records `{ key: eqref receiver identity, bag: $Object }`;
`__closure_bag_lookup` returns that same bag only after `ref.eq` with the original
receiver. The native `__defineProperty_accessor` and value twin already route a
user-instance receiver through `defineCarrierBagSubstitutionArm`, which tests the
existing instance substrate, creates or reuses this identity-keyed bag before the
ordinary `$Object` descriptor path validates and applies the definition.
`__obj_find` then proves a live *own* entry in that exact bag: it skips
`FLAG_TOMBSTONE`, so neither an absent entry nor a deleted entry is admitted, and
it never infers absence from the stored value (including `undefined`). The reader
checkpoint already consumes this same fact: `fillClosedStructExternGetArms` gives
a live bag descriptor precedence over a physical field and uses
`__reflect_get_receiver(bag, key, original)` to preserve accessor `this`.

IR confirmed that this is a consumer-only seam with no conflicting producer or
layout owner. That is ownership clearance, not blanket semantic acceptance; the
following source admission proof is the implementation boundary. The narrow
candidate is consumer-only in `carrier-bag-delete.ts`:

1. Build a private list of existing anonymous closed-shape entries carrying the
   already-established `typeIdx` plus `$shape` id/index when canonicalization
   requires it. This is a static dispatch list, **not** a new generic carrier
   predicate and not a claim about literal allocation provenance. The runtime
   admission remains the exact receiver's live bag entry.
2. Place its lookup-only arm after the existing closure, native-generator, vec,
   Error, and #5753 class arms. The class arm retains its own retained-marker
   repair and locals 3/4/5; any new scratch locals must be appended after that
   actual replacement. No change may widen `IS_INSTANCE_EXPANDO_CARRIER`,
   `IS_CLASS_INSTANCE_CARRIER`, or the closure/generator classifiers.
3. On a type-and-shape hit, call the existing `__closure_bag_lookup`; null or a
   non-`$Object` bag returns `-1`. Call the existing `__obj_find` and return
   `-1` for no live entry. This both prevents cross-instance effects and makes a
   failed/untaken definition inert.
4. Before delegation, read the **stored** key from that `$PropEntry`, rather
   than replaying the caller key after lookup. A string entry is flattened and
   compared through the existing native string equality helper against every
   exposed physical own-field name of the matched shape. A collision returns
   `-1`: deleting an overlay while leaving a physical field would resurrect
   stale storage. A physical `@@…` name is declined wholesale because it can
   mean a well-known Symbol slot which the string-only comparison cannot prove
   distinct. Field filtering must use `exposedClosedStructFieldName` plus
   `isInternalStructFieldName`, so legal user `$`/`__` keys are not silently
   erased as compiler internals.
5. Only then delegate to the existing `__delete_property(bag, storedKey)`, preserving
   its `-1/0/1` protocol, configurability refusal, tombstone/count bookkeeping,
   and strict-mode caller behavior. There is no copied delete algorithm.

This explains why a nonliteral receiver of an admitted anonymous type can be
safe without a marker: the bag is keyed to that concrete receiver, and a live
entry whose stored key is not any physical own field is a true expando regardless
of which allocation path produced the receiver. A receiver without a bag, without
a live entry, with a physical collision, or without an exact logical shape remains
unhandled and retains current behavior. This is deliberately narrower than a
claim that every `__anon_` allocation is a literal.

**Implemented source admission (revised controls await a fresh test lease).**
The selector is intentionally a static inventory gate, not a runtime `__anon_`
name test:

1. It runs only in standalone/WASI and declines every non-undefined
   `linkBrandRoleOf(ctx)` result, matching the branding finalizer's actual
   consumer/provider classification rather than duplicating its flags. A linked
   peer can contribute a canonical twin outside this module's inventory; this
   slice preserves the old `-1` route rather than relying on an implicit
   cross-module receipt.
2. Each candidate must be one exact `__anon_` registry entry: its
   `structMap`/reverse-map identity is one-to-one, `typeDef.name` agrees with
   the map key, and `typeDef.fields === ctx.structFields.get(name)`. Missing
   fields, aliases, a nominal parent/child edge, a `noBrandShapeTypes` entry,
   or any fnctor cold/layout registration declines the whole candidate.
3. The candidate must be a bare type after the `__vec_base` shape-brand anchor.
   This helper is filled after `resolveAndRecordShapeStamping` and before the
   final `brandCollidingShapeTypes` pass in both compile pipelines. A surviving
   candidate is therefore either unique or gets the existing trailing nominal
   brand before encoding; a static `$shape` guard is additionally required when
   a logical collision stamp exists. The finalizer's own no-brand/supertype/
   anchor exclusions match this selector, so an unknown canonical or subtype
   state stays unhandled rather than widening `ref.test`.
4. Physical inventory walks every recorded field, using `!== undefined`, not
   truthiness: `""` is physical, and recorded `$…`/`__…` keys remain physical
   while compiler bookkeeping stays hidden. A recorded `$constructor` carries
   both its raw spelling and the dynamic reader's exposed `constructor`
   spelling. A physical `@@…` name declines the entire candidate, because the
   compiler may use that spelling for a well-known Symbol field. Every admitted
   comparison literal is preflighted from an already-materialized global/helper;
   FINALIZE never mints a literal global or oversized helper. The stored
   `$PropEntry.key` is flattened only after `__obj_find`, then becomes the
   delegated delete key so this new arm does not add a caller-key coercion
   replay. This is not a blanket claim that the existing lookup performs only
   one coercion for every possible external key.
5. The arm calls lookup only; it never ensures a bag. It records a candidate
   ordinal only after a non-null identity lookup, retains `-1/0/1`, and invokes
   the existing `__delete_property` only after a live entry and no physical-key
   collision. A collision returns `-1`, so it cannot delete an overlay and
   resurrect a stale slot.

`ensureObjectRuntime` reserves closure-bag helpers unconditionally in the
standalone/WASI path before it emits `__delete_property`; that emission calls
`reserveCarrierBagDelete` before its own call site is baked. Thus an
anonymous-only module already has a reserved helper. The fill gate names the
anonymous arm independently so a closure/vec/Error arm cannot conceal a
no-demand failure.

The implementation adds only the private candidate collector, lookup arm, and
stored-key collision screen in `carrier-bag-delete.ts`; it does not add a
context field, generic classifier, sidecar, marker, ABI receipt, producer, or
layout mutation. Its scratch locals are appended from the actual local count.
The published branch does not yet contain #5753's class retained-marker hunk.
An actual `cddba56b` composition worktree is still required: its class arm and
retained-marker path must remain ahead of this arm and retain locals 3/4/5;
only then may this slice append its locals from the resulting list.

The first focused lease attempt was intentionally treated as fixture
preflight, not a behavior verdict. Its direct `const first = { ... }` /
`const second = { ... }` receivers were deliberately promoted by the
growable-literal pass to open `$Object` carriers after their dynamic
define/delete operations. The emitted WAT showed both receiver locals as
`externref`, rather than an `__anon_*` type, so the three observed fixture
failures could not establish an anonymous-arm defect. That preliminary run
settled 7/10 tests; it has no durable green/red claim or retained acceptance
log. The replacement sources bind the nested `raw` value of an outer template,
matching the original `indexOnly` allocation shape instead of a direct mutable
receiver literal.

The revised fixture adds an intended WAT admission assertion for the original
`RAW_READER_SOURCE` index-only receiver: numeric structural producer/store
(`struct.new` or outer-template `struct.get`, including plain temporary
transfers) and `ref.test` operands must be mapped back through the explicit
type table, then tied to the matching `__carrier_bag_delete` arm. This is meant
to provide a reviewable all-or-nothing physical-literal-materialization proof
for the target receiver; the source uses pure `selectNativeStringLiteral`
lookup and declines missing globals/helpers rather than finalizing a new
literal helper.

The first revised-fixture run was a **diagnostic preflight, not acceptance**:
Node 24 direct Vitest at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-anon-delete-revised12-20260920.log` settled **6 pass /
6 fail**. The ordinary-reader runtime mask itself still passes, but the
structural probe found no WAT local named `indexOnly`; compiler locals are
generated names and its type operands are numeric. A second probe saw WAT
formatter label `type66`, which is likewise not evidence that the receiver is
not anonymous. Those assertions need a persisted WAT artifact and a structural
producer-to-slot-to-helper identity trace, not source-local-name or formatted
type-name matching.

The same run also exposed a TypeScript-only `PropertyKey` rejection in the
coercion fixture; its source now casts **only the key** (`firstKey as any` /
`secondKey as any`) and retains concrete receiver inference, so it has not
silently selected the open-object path. The strict-delete invalid-Wasm,
physical-field exception, and Symbol snapshot results are unclassified until
each is paired against the exact untouched `35e040c` base. No result from that
preflight is attributed to the anonymous delete helper.

At the next explicit compiler/test lease, run first the exact original
`built-ins/String/raw/returns-abrupt-from-next-key.js` once on this candidate
and once on an untouched `35e040c` compiler/harness. Then pair the three
unclassified fixture cases against that same base before changing their
expectations. For the structural probe, set `JS2WASM_5152_WAT_DIR` to a
dedicated temporary directory: the fixture writes each successful `emitWat`
artifact there before it evaluates its assertions. Preserve that artifact and
derive the producer-to-slot-to-helper trace from it; a passing
`RAW_READER_SOURCE` runtime mask alone does not establish closed-carrier
admission.

Required lease-time controls are: the exact delete/reassign String.raw original;
the exact `indexOnly` numeric-WAT type/ref-test admission proof; an
anonymous-only, concretely inferred data-expando module with no user closure/vec
demand plus receiver-local WAT construction/ref-test evidence; accessor/data
true expandos; non-configurable sloppy/strict behavior; repeat/missing delete;
independent same-shaped objects plus a nonliteral allocation; public operator
and Reflect object-key coercion counts; noBrand/super/alias/layout and
linked-decline structural probes; and unchanged class retained-marker, fnctor,
generator, closure, vec, and Error lanes. Physical `length`, `""`, `$…`,
`__…`, raw `$constructor`, exposed `constructor`, and Symbol.iterator/`@@iterator`
controls are deliberately labeled **nonconforming baseline snapshots**. Their
stage and payload must be observed separately before any preservation assertion
is accepted; they are not a claim that physical descriptor deletion is now
ordinary-delete complete. The revised 12-test fixture keeps
`Reflect.deleteProperty` refusal and strict operator throwing as separate
assertions; its corrected rerun waits for the next compiler/test lease.

#### 2026-09-20 paired residual receipt and fixture-boundary correction

The exact original row has now been run against the same compiler base rather
than inferred from the earlier fixture:

- candidate, this anonymous-delete worktree:
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-return-abrupt-candidate-delete-35e-20260920.log` —
  **1 pass**;
- detached untouched `35e040c08ed10f793faf26bb0f0eac55be662627`:
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-return-abrupt-base-35e-20260920.log` — **1 fail**,
  `strict rerun: TypeError: TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property`.

That is one localized original-row gain. It is not a frozen-30 result, a
whole-issue completion claim, or artifact/import proof: the isolated Test262
runner reports the row verdict but not the emitted module imports. A later
candidate rerun will set `JS2WASM_DUMP_WAT_FN=test,__carrier_bag_delete` and
`JS2WASM_DUMP_TYPES=<durable temporary prefix>` so the exact original's WAT
can be retained before any producer-to-slot-to-helper assertion is accepted.

The same source fixtures were paired against the candidate and detached 35e
base through `/private/tmp/js2-5152-delete-fixture-pair-20260920.mts`:

1. Strict non-configurable operator delete reaches the same standalone Wasm
   validation `CompileError` in both trees (including the reported offset).
   Direct strict Node returns `1`, so this is an unchanged compiler limitation,
   not a passing standalone assertion.
2. The physical-field fixture had equal compilation receipts and empty reported
   imports, but the original pair driver caught module construction,
   instantiation, and export invocation in one block. Its
   `instantiated:false` record is therefore **not** evidence of an
   instantiation failure and must not be cited as physical-delete behavior.
3. The Symbol/`@@iterator` fixture invokes and returns `1` in both trees. That
   is a baseline snapshot, not Symbol-delete conformance.

The focused TypeScript fixture now has an explicit `observeStandalone` helper
that records `compile`, `module`, `instance`, `invoke`, and `invoke-throw`
separately, including imports at the point a module is valid. The external
pair driver has the same staging repair. Positive true-expando tests are kept
separate from these named baseline limitations; no known limitation is folded
into an aggregate passing mask. The obsolete WAT checks that guessed a source
local name or interpreted formatter `typeNN` labels as anonymous-shape proof
were removed. Opt-in `JS2WASM_5152_WAT_DIR` capture writes WAT before any
review assertion, and the next run must inspect the artifact structurally
rather than recreate that label assumption.

The remaining lease-time order is intentionally bounded: capture the exact
original artifact and verdict; run the repaired focused fixture to classify
its limitation stages; then run the frozen 30-path standalone String.raw
manifest unchanged. The #5753 retained-class composition receipt remains a
separate prerequisite for deletion publication and is not implied by these
anonymous-only results.

#### 2026-09-20 terminal standalone receipts; publication boundary remains open

The ordered lease-time runs above are terminal on this candidate:

- exact `returns-abrupt-from-next-key.js` with artifact dump: **1 pass**, 0
  non-pass —
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-return-abrupt-candidate-artifact-run-20260920.log`;
- repaired focused `issue-5152-raw-readers.test.ts`: **12/12 pass** —
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-anon-delete-repaired-fixture-20260920.log`;
- frozen 30-path standalone String.raw manifest: **30 pass**, 0 non-pass,
  exit 0 —
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-string-raw-frozen30-delete-candidate-20260920.log`.

The manifest is exactly the 30 unique corpus paths in
`plan/agent-context/5152-string-raw-es2015-paths-20260919.txt`, SHA-256
`d7d2c223fb766dcc9ed460d3c2ddad520195dfc007db6d3c4f575575ba3e3827`.
The raw30 receipt is a retention gain; it does not close #5152 or the
physical-delete residual.

The original artifact files are
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-return-abrupt-candidate-artifact-20260920` (physical
type listing) and the matching `.wat`. This WAT is an explicitly **filtered
one-function diagnostic**: it contains only `__carrier_bag_delete`, whose body
has `anonCandidate` / `anonEntry` and a `ref.test (ref 82)` arm; the type receipt
identifies `82` as `__anon_1` with its physical `length` field. That is useful
helper-admission evidence only. It cannot prove original binary imports or the
exact producer-to-slot-to-anonymous-helper path, because it does not contain a
named original `test`, `__module_init`, or callback/allocation body. A fresh
run must retain `WebAssembly.Module.imports` from the actual original binary as
a separate receipt and capture the relevant module-init/callback bodies before
that structural claim is accepted. Use `rg -a` when inspecting the saved WAT:
it contains NUL data. This trace remains a publication gate, not a
formatter-label substitution.

`/private/tmp/js2-5152-original-artifact-receipt-20260920.mts` is prepared
for that fresh run. It assembles the original Test262 harness source with the
same standalone compile options used by `runOriginalHarnessVariant`, writes the
exact primary/strict source hashes and full WAT, and records both compiler-
reported and `WebAssembly.Module.imports` manifests.

**Terminal full-artifact receipt.** The diagnostic subsequently ran on the
candidate and saved
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-return-abrupt-full-artifact-candidate-run-20260920.log`.
Both original-harness variants compiled successfully with the same one
`IR-FALLBACK` warning for `$DONOTEVALUATE`; each records
`reportedImports: []` and actual `WebAssembly.Module.imports: []`, plus these
source/binary SHA-256 pairs:

- primary source `82fb5616d323f3403890c1ca8e9371ef786528435cfee40c7049261f5dbfbe42`,
  binary `822fce6acbb7aca3fb3bdcafde9fb420370cdbdc27b6dc670b74e30f05a39f20`;
- strict source `f3b572e0884d42b7686acded4302f6daa5cc235cc274f488556536e1d7ab33ad`,
  binary `0d75c4370653fce936088df345c0fc4937a292bcba209afaff8fdb91782e9b29`.

The full strict WAT and exact assembled strict source are retained as
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-return-abrupt-full-artifact-candidate-20260920-strict.wat`
and `.source.js`. They establish the static lowering chain without relying on
a formatter local name:

1. The exact strict source constructs the only `obj.raw` nested literal at
   source lines 337–341 and executes `delete obj.raw['0']` at line 354.
2. The full WAT names type 82 `__anon_1` with its physical `length` field
   (line 60), and type 83 `__anon_2` with a `raw: (ref null 82)` field
   (line 61). `__module_init_chunk_0` constructs 82 then 83 and stores the
   outer value at lines 125193–125196.
3. That same chunk extracts `struct.get 83 0` to its delete receiver local at
   lines 125393–125397 and issues `call 170` at lines 125435–125437. Function
   170 is named `__delete_property`; its full body invokes function 169,
   `__carrier_bag_delete`, on the applicable non-vector carrier route. The
   helper includes the anonymous `ref.test (ref 82)` arm.

This is a static producer-to-slot-to-delete-helper receipt for the original
strict variant, not a runtime branch-trace claim. It removes the earlier
filtered-WAT ambiguity while retaining the independent row verdict and actual
import manifests.

The repaired focused file has eight positive checks and four deliberately
named baseline observations. The latter now record, without changing their
meaning, strict and coercion validation failures at `module`, the physical
case's guest `invoke-throw` with an opaque object payload, and the Symbol case's
`invoke` result `1`. The 12/12 count must never be summarized as 12
conformance successes. The physical payload is intentionally not claimed to
be an instantiation error or an ordinary-delete result.

A temporary candidate/base pair of a manually mirrored coercion program has
the same `module` validation error in both trees, but it is not an exact
extraction of the revised fixture source. It is diagnostic-only. The retained
pair driver now has an `exact-coercion` mode that extracts
`ANONYMOUS_EXPANDO_DELETE_COERCION_SOURCE` from this candidate test file and
passes that one source path to both compilers. That exact-source candidate/35e
pair is now terminal:

- candidate:
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-delete-pair-candidate-exact-coercion-35e-20260920.log`;
- untouched 35e:
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-delete-pair-base-exact-coercion-35e-20260920.log`.

Both compile successfully with `imports: []` and then fail at the same module
validation point, with the identical `function #50:"test"`, `fallthru[0]`,
`expected i32, got (ref null 46)`, and `@+55345` detail. The focused coercion
observation is therefore regression-cleared as an unchanged baseline
limitation, while still not counted as a compiled delete-semantics pass.

#### 2026-09-20 frozen #5753 class/anonymous composition receipt

The required composition was performed only in the disposable worktree
`codex-5152-anon-delete-5753-composition-20260920`, rooted at frozen
`cddba56b768f30eb5d9af29d2954dd69e2b534b5`. It preserves that checkpoint's
actual class retained-marker implementation: closure, generator, vec, Error,
class, then anonymous arm order; class locals 3/4/5; the retained-marker
branch before the common object lookup; and its existing `classArm` lookup
claim. The composition appends the anonymous scratch locals only after the
class replacement (6–9 when the class arm is present), and does not alter the
class helper or publish a copy of #5753-owned code.

The unchanged frozen class suite plus a disposable one-module joint control
passed **97/97** in 104.37 seconds:
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-5753-frozen-composition-20260920.log`. The joint module
contains both a class expando and two same-shaped nested `{ raw: { length: 1 } }`
receivers. It validates as a standalone module with no imports and returns the
direct-Node mask 63. To establish that this is not a vacuous alternate path,
the exact same compact fixture was run against an untouched detached `cddba56b`
compiler root. It intentionally failed its 63 assertion with actual **27**:
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-5753-composition-untouched-cdd-20260920.log`. The
36-point difference is exactly the two anonymous deletion observations (4 and
32); class deletion/physical-slot checks (1 and 2), raw `length` (8), and the
second receiver's pre-delete expando observation (16) remain in the untouched
result.

This is a frozen source-compatibility and attribution receipt only. Frozen
`cddba56b` predates the landed reader checkpoint and #5994, so it does not
substitute for latest-main integration, final frozen raw30 retention, or the
Array-HOF five-row retention run. The disposable source/test changes are not
part of this #5152 publication branch.

#### 2026-09-20 synced publication-tree retention

After checkpoint `88bd7169a8` and the clean merge of upstream
`200f7e2c8bc00dfb9a9c50dcc4b6570413f8a567`, both frozen manifests were rerun
through the maintained isolated standalone runner on this publication tree:

- String.raw: **30 pass / 0 non-pass** —
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-string-raw-frozen30-latest-sync-20260920.log`;
- Array-HOF subclass regression set: **5 pass / 0 non-pass** —
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-array-hof-five-latest-sync-20260920.log`.

These latest-tree receipts retain the two landed reader gains and the Array
regression repair while the anonymous true-expando deletion slice is present.
They do not turn the frozen #5753 composition receipt into a current-main
class integration claim: no #5753-owned source was copied into this branch.
Physical-field collisions, the strict/coercion baseline validation failures,
and other explicitly named descriptor-lifecycle limitations remain outside the
true-expando admission and are not presented as ordinary-delete conformance.

#### 2026-09-20 deletion-slice publication handoff

Before this handoff note, the local deletion-slice source checkpoint was clean
at `ead8e8520ae132a36e794364349e33d30979bf55`. Its final small source correction
gives the two conditional instruction fragments in
`fillCarrierBagDelete` contextual `Instr[]` types; it preserves the reviewed
operation sequence and lets TS7 validate the nested Wasm `if` rather than
using a broad cast. Direct TS7 against `tsconfig.ts7.json` exited zero, and
the post-correction focused reader fixture is **12/12**:
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-readers-after-ts7-gate-fix-20260920.log`. As above,
four of those named checks are baseline observations rather than conformance
passes.

This worktree initially lacked only its local `node_modules/typescript7`
entry. It now has a missing-only local symlink to the already verified canonical
dependency at `/Users/thomas/Code/js2/node_modules/typescript7`; no dependency
tree was overwritten, installed, purged, or committed. That repair lets the
normal hook's TS7 command resolve from the worktree without changing the
repository payload.

The normal hooked commit for that type-only correction is `ead8e8520a`. Its
fast pre-commit gates (Prettier, Biome, LOC budget, and function budget) passed.
The required normal `git push --set-upstream fork
codex/5152-anon-expando-delete-20260920` has **not** begun its pre-push hooks
or updated a remote: the environment denied it before execution as sensitive
egress because the fork ownership/payload lacked explicit current approval.
That attempt made no remote change. The user has now explicitly renewed
authorization to push completed branches to `ttraenkler/js2`, with fallback
to a feature branch on `loopdive/js2` if the fork push fails. This does not
authorize pushing `main`. The user also explicitly permits unsigned commits
for these fixes; normal repository hooks remain required.

The prepared repository-template PR body is retained locally at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-pr-body-20260920.md`. With push approval now supplied,
the remaining sequence is: run the normal pre-push gates and fork
push with the validated Node 24/pnpm 10 route; verify the remote head; create
the ready upstream PR with that body; and retain the known-shape residuals and
the frozen-#5753-versus-current-main distinction. This remains a partial
true-expando deletion slice, not whole-#5152 completion.

#### Required gates before publishing this reader/mirror checkpoint

When the compiler/test lease is next granted, run (and retain terminal logs
for) the following against this frozen source before any commit or PR:

1. `git diff --check`; the five-case focused fixture (including direct Node,
   standalone no-import, host baseline snapshot, and native-first control);
   then the exact isolated three rows and frozen 30-path standalone manifest.
2. Existing narrow reader regressions `tests/issue-3147.test.ts` and
   `tests/issue-4397-native-semantic-js-host.test.ts`, plus a fresh TS7
   invocation resolved from this worktree's canonical dependency source.
3. Normal quality gates: format check, lint, LOC/function budgets (adding only
   a gate-proven function allowance if required), coercion-site/oracle/dead-
   export ratchets, and the normal hooks. Do not bypass hooks or modify shared
   baseline files.
4. Independent peer review after the final diff and before publication. The PR
   describes **two original improvements and 29/30 standalone manifest rows**,
   not whole-#5152 completion; it remains draft if any required gate or
   mergeability condition is unresolved.

#### Terminal reader/mirror gate record (2026-09-20)

All commands below used the worktree's direct installed Node 24/tool binaries
where applicable; the normal commit/push hooks remain to be run without a
bypass after the temporary RegExp lease handback.

- Full Git-LFS-aware `git diff --check` passed. The focused fixture passed
  **5/5** both directly and through the normal changed-root runner (one changed
  root file). The final focused log is
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-readers-vitest-after-coercion-local-20260920.log`.
- The isolated three-original runner settled **2 pass / 1 fail** and the frozen
  manifest settled **29 pass / 1 fail / 0 skip**, both with only the documented
  delete/reassign residual. Logs are
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-raw-three-final-20260920.log` and
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-string-raw-30-final-20260920.log`.
- The narrow #3147 regression file passed. #4397's URI escape assertion fails
  identically on candidate and untouched `4a6`, so it is preserved as a
  baseline failure, not attributed to this change; logs are
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-native-reader-regressions-20260920.log` and
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-issue-4397-base-4a6-20260920.log`.
- TS7, Prettier, and Biome pass at
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-typecheck-ts7-final-20260920.log` and
  `/private/tmp/js2-5152-format-lint-final-20260920.log`. LOC and function
  ratchets pass using only the measured allowances recorded in this issue;
  oracle and coercion ratchets pass, with `object-runtime.ts`'s one shared
  `number_toString` property-key call explicitly allowed.
- Dead-export preservation, codegen-fallback, stack-balance, host-import, and
  numeric-local checks pass. The dead-export tool retains its pre-existing
  strict modeled-closure unknowns for two nonliteral dynamic imports while its
  preservation contract passes; it is not claimed as retirement certification.

This is a **reader/mirror checkpoint**, not #5152 closure or full JS-host
parity. No deletion code, shared baseline update, skip-list change, or host
import is included.

#### 2026-09-20 landed reader receipt — immutable ES2015 baseline

The landed #5991 reader/mirror result was independently remeasured from
immutable baseline `950cf4b00bf4375742a5b6a6a84a5f39cf46eb7` using compiler
`d5e58586d1`. The generated JSONL has SHA-256
`d954ebc1c02232e8d99faa2cde1b2b8b6b30f4f9a4a44ebd34b595b1a3a976b1` and
contains 48,735 unique oracle-14 / honest / auto rows. Its ES2015 selection is
10,371 pass / 1,047 fail / 286 compile-error (11,704 total).

Compared with the prior `bb397` receipt, exactly two ES2015 status changes
exist: `template-length-throws` and `nextkey-is-symbol-throws`, each
fail-to-pass. No other ES2015 row changed. The raw receipt files are retained
at `/private/tmp/js2-es2015-baseline-20260920.uTtFjf/`. This records the landed
reader improvement only; anonymous-expando deletion and the remaining
`returns-abrupt-from-next-key` lifecycle residual remain pending.

### 2026-09-20 Array HOF subclass regression containment

The fresh full-corpus receipt found five non-ES2015 pass-to-fail rows after the
reader/mirror checkpoint. They are intentionally tracked here as a regression
follow-up, not folded into the prior String.raw gain claim. The frozen reduced
manifest is
`plan/agent-context/5152-array-subclass-regression-paths-20260920.txt`
(five unique pinned-corpus paths, SHA-256
`ab15801cdd5330ca442019ac142583e98fd22a46e56d537dd11cc4100397c0db`):

- `built-ins/Array/prototype/some/15.4.4.17-8-10.js`
- `built-ins/Array/prototype/forEach/15.4.4.18-8-10.js`
- `built-ins/Array/prototype/map/15.4.4.19-9-3.js`
- `built-ins/Array/prototype/filter/15.4.4.20-10-3.js`
- `built-ins/Array/prototype/every/15.4.4.16-8-10.js`

Fresh Node 24 isolated standalone runs through the runner's own
`runTest262File` establish the boundary before this follow-up makes a source
change: untouched `4a6cbdf1ee80b5d1618a7c87b014bc792f0fddc7` is **5 pass**
(`/private/tmp/js2-5152-array-hof-five-base-4a6-20260920.log`), while the
landed reader checkpoint at
`35e040c08ed10f793faf26bb0f0eac55be662627` is **5 fail**
(` /private/tmp/js2-5152-array-hof-five-candidate-35e-20260920.log`). Every
candidate failure is `illegal cast in __extern_has` through
`__extern_has_idx ← __hof_*`. The source range from the old baseline compiler
to the landed reader commit contains only the #5991 reader files and fixture,
which makes this a strong attribution; the explicit A/B above is the
authoritative proof.

The affected programs construct a raw function-constructor instance after
making its live `F.prototype` array-like. #5991 admitted every allocated
user-declared struct to the new ordinary array-like Get/Has route, then marked
that type seen before the legacy candidate collector reached
`fnctorArray.fnctorPrototypeGlobalForStruct`. As a result, the raw fnctor
entered `__extern_has` rather than its established own-index plus recursive
prototype route, where the generic helper attempts a `$Object` cast.

The narrow correction preserves the legacy candidate lane only when the
existing `fnctorPrototypeGlobalForStruct(ctx, structName)` provider returns a
live prototype global. It does not blacklist all `__fnctor_*` values or user
classes: descriptor-backed ordinary readers retain their #5991 admission for
all other eligible types. Required validation is the same frozen five-path
isolated command after the edit, followed by the frozen 30-path standalone
String.raw manifest to prove that the two landed original gains remain intact.
No anonymous-expando deletion source belongs in this follow-up.

Terminal follow-up evidence, again using Node 24 and the runner's isolated
mode, is **5 pass / 0 non-pass** after the guard at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-array-hof-five-after-fnctor-proto-guard-20260920.log`.
The frozen standalone String.raw manifest then remains **29 pass / 1 fail** at
`/private/tmp/js2-5152-string-raw-30-after-fnctor-proto-guard-20260920.log`;
its sole non-pass is the pre-existing
`built-ins/String/raw/returns-abrupt-from-next-key.js` strict setter/delete
residual. This follow-up therefore restores the five unrelated Array rows
without trading away either landed String.raw improvement.

### Step F — String.raw fidelity (3 tests)

1. Descriptor loss: the template arg in
   `src/codegen/expressions/call-builtin-static.ts` L805-825 goes through
   `materializeStructAsDynamicObject`, which snapshots values — accessors
   later installed by `Object.defineProperty` on the (nested) `raw` object are
   invisible to the helper's `__extern_get` even though a DIRECT property
   read runs them (probes r1 pass / r2+q6 fail isolate this). Fix by keeping
   identity: when the template's value flows from a variable (not a fresh
   literal), pass the live representation the direct-read path consults
   instead of a copy (or materialize the literal ONCE at creation). Verify
   `__extern_length`'s array-like arm then propagates the throwing `length`
   getter (string-raw.ts header notes it is designed to).
2. `nextkey-is-symbol-throws.js` (Symbol-valued segment → TypeError) falls out
   of Step D.2's throwing `__extern_toString` variant — `__str_raw` already
   coerces segments through `__extern_toString` (string-raw.ts L26).

### Step G — runtime IsRegExp in includes/startsWith/endsWith (3 tests)

In the three arms (`src/codegen/string-ops.ts` L3037-3080), for a search arg
not statically proven string-like, emit before ToString: if the arg is an
object → `__extern_get(arg, __box_symbol(7))` (getter runs, abrupt
propagates); if the result is not undefined → ToBoolean → TypeError (reuse the
existing #2598 message); if undefined → `ref.test $NativeRegExp` → TypeError.
Same GetMethod-read shape as Step A.1.

### Step H — codePointAt undefined (2 tests)

`src/codegen/string-ops.ts` L3462-3560: replace the plain-NaN OOB result with
the dedicated undefined f64 sentinel (`undefSentinel: true` ValType +
`emitIsUndefF64`, the same machinery `compileStringIntegerArg` reads at
L2404/L2423-2431) so `=== undefined` / `??` observe undefined; js-host got
this in #2004 — mirror its result-kind decision for the standalone lowering.

### Step K — padStart/padEnd Symbol fill (2 tests)

`src/codegen/string-ops.ts` L3215-3217 and L3250-3252: replace the bare
`compileExpression + emitFlatten()` of the fill arg with
`emitArgAsNativeString` (L463) + flatten — its `tryThrowOnSymbolStringCoercion`
guard turns today's INVALID WASM (i32 symbol id pushed where
`(ref null $AnyString)` is expected) into the spec TypeError.

### Step I — fromCodePoint(Symbol) (1 test)

`compileFromCharCodeFamily` callers in
`src/codegen/expressions/call-builtin-static.ts` L750-777: reject
Symbol-typed args statically (the `tryThrowOnBigIntOrSymbolArg` pattern,
string-ops.ts L2330) and let Step D.2's runtime ToNumber Symbol arm cover the
dynamic case.

### Deferred — cluster J (3 tests)

`proto-from-ctor-realm.js`, `valueOf/non-generic-realm.js`,
`toString/non-generic-realm.js` need per-realm builtin identity; that is
#4274 (ready) + #4634. Do not attempt here; do not count them against this
issue's acceptance.

### What NOT to do

- No new host imports; every mechanism above is pure-Wasm
  (`__extern_get`/`__box_symbol`/`__call_fn_method_N` are in-module defined
  functions in standalone).
- Never edit `tests/test262-runner.ts`, HANGING_TESTS/skip lists, or
  `scripts/*-baseline.json` / `scripts/ir-fallback-baseline.json`.
- Do not "fix" `String(sym)` to throw (only implicit ToString throws).
- Do not delete the #1474 refusal diagnostic wholesale — narrow it to the
  forms Step A still cannot dispatch.
- Do not enqueue/re-enqueue PRs; run the ratchet gates before every commit
  (chained, unpiped — see CLAUDE.md "Hooks and ratchet gates").

## Acceptance criteria

- All 50 non-deferred tests in `.tmp/es2015/wp-string-current-fails.txt` pass
  via `npx tsx .tmp/run-standalone.mts --list .tmp/es2015/wp-string-current-fails.txt`
  (the 3 cluster-J paths in `.tmp/es2015/str-cl-J-realm-deferred.txt` are
  accepted as still-failing; everything else must pass). Full success = only
  those 3 remain.
- Every test in `.tmp/es2015/wp-string-passing-spotcheck.txt` (40 paths)
  still passes via the same probe.
- Source-ratchet gates pass: `node scripts/check-loc-budget.mjs && node
  scripts/check-func-budget.mjs && node scripts/check-coercion-sites.mjs &&
  npm run -s check:oracle-ratchet && npm run -s check:dead-exports`.
- Equivalence tests pass: `npm test -- tests/equivalence.test.ts`.

## Results (wave 1 implementation, 2026-08-29)

Target list `.tmp/es2015/wp-string-current-fails.txt` re-verified on the branch
base before any edit: **53 failing** (52 FAIL + 1 COMPILE_ERROR) — the plan's
count reproduced exactly, nothing already fixed.

After this change-set: **29 failing, 24 fixed.** The 40-path
`wp-string-passing-spotcheck.txt` regression guard stayed 40/40 PASS throughout.

| cluster | planned | fixed | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| K padStart/padEnd Symbol fill | 2 | **2** | `emitArgAsNativeString` for the fill arg — the §7.1.17 guard turns invalid Wasm into the spec TypeError |
| I fromCodePoint(Symbol) | 1 | **1** | static Symbol/BigInt rejection in `compileFromCharCodeFamily`'s per-arg ToNumber |
| H codePointAt OOB | 2 | **2** | `UNDEF_F64_BITS` sentinel + `undefSentinel: true` result type (standalone only) |
| E astral case mapping | 4 | **4** | new `ASTRAL_{UPPER,LOWER}_CASE_RUNS` tables + surrogate-pair decode/re-encode in pass 2 |
| B normalize | 10 | **7** | validation + preamble; the 3 `return-normalized-string*` tests need real NFC/NFD tables (wave 2) |
| C `String.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` | 5 | **5** | `@@1` glue member with ROC + ToString + the code-point vec |
| G runtime IsRegExp | 3 | **3** | new `src/codegen/string-isregexp-guard.ts` — `Get(arg, @@match)` runs, abrupt propagates |
| A @@protocol dispatch | 15 | 0 | **not attempted** — see below |
| D indexOf ToPrimitive | 5 | 0 | **blocked** — see below |
| F String.raw fidelity | 3 | 0 | **not attempted** — see below |
| J cross-realm | 3 | 0 | deferred by the plan (#4274/#4634) |

### Deliberately left for wave 2

- **Cluster A (15)** — the runtime `@@match/@@search/@@split/@@replace` GetMethod
  lane. Calling an arbitrary user method needs the `__call_fn_method_N` arity
  dispatcher, which is filled at FINALIZE time and carries its own declared-arity
  ladder (`objlit-to-primitive.ts`); wiring it into six string-method arms plus
  the `<Builtin>.prototype[Symbol.X]` reflective READ fix is a change of its own
  size and risk. `split/limit-touint32-error.js` is in this cluster but is purely
  a coercion-ORDER fix; it still needs holding an un-coerced separator across the
  limit coercion, which `stageCoercedOperands` cannot express today.
- **Cluster D (5)** — MEASURED root cause, narrower than the plan's: the runtime
  ToPrimitive walker does find `@@toPrimitive` installed by ASSIGNMENT and does
  unbox `Object(Symbol())`/`Object("foo")` correctly (verified through the
  reflective `String.prototype.indexOf.call` lane, which already routes through
  `emitStringProtoToStringFlat`). What it cannot see is a `@@toPrimitive` written
  as a COMPUTED KEY IN AN OBJECT LITERAL — that literal compiles to a closed
  struct. Every one of the five files contains at least one such literal, so
  none of them flips until the literal lowering is fixed; routing indexOf's arg
  through the reflective ToString lane alone buys zero tests.
- **Cluster F (3)** — `materializeStructAsDynamicObject` snapshots the template,
  losing accessors installed later on the nested `raw` object.

Equivalence gate (`npm run -s test:equivalence:gate`): 1718 passing, 24 failing,
all 24 in the committed baseline — no new regressions. Source-ratchet gates all
green with the allowances granted in this file's frontmatter.

### Files touched

`src/codegen/string-ops.ts`, `src/codegen/case-convert-native.ts`,
`src/codegen/case-tables.ts` (generated), `scripts/gen-case-tables.mjs`,
`src/codegen/array-object-proto.ts`, `src/codegen/string-proto-tostring.ts`,
`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`, and the new
`src/codegen/string-isregexp-guard.ts`.

`scripts/gen-case-tables.mjs` grew an `astralPairs` scan; the astral tables were
SPLICED into `src/codegen/case-tables.ts` rather than regenerating the whole
file, because this container runs Node v22 while the committed BMP tables were
generated on Node v24 — a blind re-run would have silently downgraded the BMP
Unicode data (one Latin-Extended run differs).

## 2026-09-20 PR #5999 compiler-boundary inventory repair

The initial ready PR for the completed Unicode 17 normalize slice,
https://github.com/loopdive/js2/pull/5999, exposed a real CI metadata omission:
its `quality` job ran
`node --max-old-space-size=2048 scripts/check-compiler-boundaries.mjs --mode inventory --base HEAD^1`
and failed only because the three new source modules were unclassified. The
failure named `src/codegen/normalize-native.ts`,
`src/codegen/normalize-tables.ts`, and
`src/codegen/string-proto-normalize.ts` as both unclassified modules and
targets. This is not a normalization algorithm, test, baseline, verifier, or
CI-policy failure.

The narrow repair adds exactly those three `mixed-needs-split` records to
`scripts/compiler-boundaries.json`, matching the adjacent native-string and
string-prototype codegen classifications: destination `backend-wasmgc`, owner
`3518-coordinator`, and the existing AST/context/physical-resource/native-runtime
next-boundary wording. It changes neither the inventory verifier nor its
baseline/allowlist semantics. After the record addition, rerun the exact
inventory command against `HEAD^1`; only after a green static receipt may this
metadata-only follow-up be committed and pushed through normal hooks.

That targeted static receipt is terminal: the command exits **0** with
`status: inventory-valid-architecture-incomplete`, `inventoryValid: true`, and
an empty `errors` array (the architecture-incomplete label is the repository's
pre-existing migration-debt state, not a new failure). It inventories 1,470
source modules with the three entries classified; no compiler, emitted-Wasm,
or test runner was invoked.

A read-only upstream refresh advanced `upstream/main` from
`62221769a87acdc32759c656702eede64936feb5` to
`ea8d7f87ff`. The branch is 3 commits ahead and 9 commits behind that head.
The incoming commits include #5998 and a Test262 baseline refresh. Their
changed paths overlap the normalize branch's existing edits in the shared
string call-site files and this issue document, while upstream does not carry
the new normalize modules, generator, or fixtures. A read-only `git merge-tree`
scan produced no textual conflict markers; no merge was performed here, and a
normal hook-slot sync must still preserve both issue histories and revalidate
the committed result.
