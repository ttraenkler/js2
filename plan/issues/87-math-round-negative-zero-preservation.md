# Issue 87: Math.round negative zero preservation

## Summary

`Math.round(x)` should return `-0` when `-0.5 <= x <= -0`, per ES spec
section 20.2.2.29. Currently returns `+0`.

## Motivation

Test262 test `S15.8.2.15_A7.js` checks:
```javascript
1 / Math.round(-0.5) === -Infinity  // expects -0
1 / Math.round(-0.25) === -Infinity // expects -0
1 / Math.round(-0) === -Infinity    // expects -0
```

Also checks large integer rounding near `1/Number.EPSILON` where `floor(x+0.5)`
loses precision due to floating point arithmetic.

## Current behavior

We implement `Math.round(x)` as `f64.floor(x + 0.5)`:
- `Math.round(-0.5)` → `floor(0.0)` → `+0` (should be `-0`)
- `Math.round(-0)` → `floor(0.5)` → `0` (should be `-0`)

## Approach

Use a host import `__mathRound` that calls JS `Math.round()` directly.
This handles all edge cases including `-0` preservation and large integer
precision. The performance cost is negligible since Math.round is rarely
in hot loops.

Alternative: implement in pure wasm with conditional checks:
```
if x >= -0.5 && x < 0 → copysign(0.0, x)  // preserve -0
else → floor(x + 0.5)
```
But this still fails for large integers near `1/EPSILON`.

## Test262 impact

Fixes 1 failing test (S15.8.2.15_A7.js), bringing Math.round to 100%.

## Complexity

S — Single host import or a few conditional wasm instructions.

## Dependencies

None.
