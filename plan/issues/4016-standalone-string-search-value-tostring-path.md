## Problem

In `--target standalone`, six `String.prototype` methods share one refusal:

```
Codegen error: String.prototype.<m>(...) with a RegExp or symbol-protocol search
value is not supported in --target standalone (#1474).
```

It fires from `src/codegen/string-ops.ts` for `match` / `matchAll` / `search`
unconditionally, and for `replace` / `replaceAll` / `split` whenever the first
argument is not *statically* a string.

**The refusal conflates two different things.** Every one of these methods
begins the same way (§22.1.3.11/.12/.13/.14/.19/.23, step 2 in each): *if the
search value is neither `undefined` nor `null`, `GetMethod(searchValue,
@@<protocol>)`, and if that is not `undefined`, call it.* Only when that lookup
comes back `undefined` does the method fall through to its own **string** path:

| method | fall-through when there is no `@@` method |
| --- | --- |
| `split` / `replace` / `replaceAll` | `ToString(searchValue)` — a plain string operation, **no regex at all** |
| `search` / `match` | `RegExpCreate(ToString(searchValue), undefined)` |
| `matchAll` | `RegExpCreate(ToString(searchValue), "g")` |

So "the argument is not a statically-known backend RegExp" is *not* the same
question as "this needs a JS host". `"a1b".split(123)` needs no regex engine and
no host; `"abc".search("b")` needs a regex built from a runtime string — and the
standalone backend has had a **runtime pattern compiler** since #2161
(`ensureDynamicStandaloneRegExpCompiler`, the same one `new RegExp(dynamicSrc)`
goes through). Verified before writing any code: a standalone probe doing
`new RegExp("A" + "B").exec("ssABB")` returns `["AB"]` at index 2.

### Measured population — stamp every number with this

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline | `test262-standalone-current.jsonl`, `--force`-refetched |
| `oracle_version` / lane | 12 / `honest` |
| Row timestamps | `1.8.2026, 22:26:58` → `22:32:46` |
| Rows / bad JSON / duplicate `file` keys | 48,619 / 0 / 0 |
| Official scope | **43,505 run / 25,929 pass (59.6 %)** |
| Goal scope (`es5id` present, or none of `es5id`/`es6id`/`esid`) | **8,545 run / 6,242 pass (73.0 %) / 2,303 non-pass** |
| Corpus files that failed to open | **401** — all newer-proposal areas (Iterator helpers 140, `AsyncDisposableStack` 52, `Promise.allKeyed` 39, …). The baseline's test262 checkout is NEWER than `/workspace/test262`. **0 of them are in this population**, and none carry `es5id`, so goal scope is unaffected (it reproduces the census's 8,545 exactly). |

Population = official rows, non-pass, whose `error` matches the refusal string:

- **99 files** all-official — `search 25 · match 20 · split 19 · replace 17 · matchAll 11 · replaceAll 7`
- **43 files** in goal scope
- Negative control: the refusal is absent from 17,477 of the 17,576 official
  non-pass rows, so the detector is not vacuous.

### What this REFUTES about the framing it was dispatched under

1. **The "51 files in goal scope" figure does not reproduce.** Cutting goal
   scope by the refusal string directly on a 5.5 h fresher baseline gives
   **43**. The "~98 all-official" figure does reproduce (**99** now).
2. **The overlap with the census's RegExp buckets is ≤ 2 files, not unknown-and-large.**
   Only 2 of the 99 live under `built-ins/RegExp/` (both
   `named-groups/groups-object-subclass*`) and 1 under `built-ins/JSON/`; the
   other 96 are under `String/prototype`. The census's *RegExp unsupported
   pattern/arity* bucket (21) is Tier-1, keyed on a **different** refusal
   string, so it is disjoint by construction — a row carries exactly one error.
   *RegExp engine semantics* (68) is Tier-2 and the census is an ordered
   first-match-wins partition, so no file can be in both. **Nothing here should
   be discounted for double-counting beyond those 2.**
3. **This is not one cluster, it is two mechanisms with very different costs**,
   and the goal-scope half is almost entirely the *cheap* one. Of the 99, the
   ~40 `cstm-*` / `custom-*-emulates-undefined` files are genuine
   `GetMethod(@@protocol)` **dispatch on a user object** — and **not one of them
   is in goal scope** (they are all `esid`-tagged ES6+ tests). Every one of the
   43 goal-scope files is the plain-`ToString` arm.
4. **`replace`/`replaceAll` is NOT reachable by removing this refusal**, even
   though it contributes 24 files to the population. Measured on a standalone
   probe: `"gnulluna".replace("null", function(a1,a2,a3){return a2+"";})` —
   which uses the *already-supported* string search value — fails today with
   `RuntimeError: illegal cast`. **Function replacers are a separate,
   pre-existing defect.** 7 of the 8 goal-scope `replace` files pass a function
   replacer (two of them via `Function("…")`, i.e. also blocked on #2928), so
   widening the gate here would convert a loud compile-time refusal into a
   runtime illegal cast. `replace`/`replaceAll` therefore keep the refusal.

## Fix

Split the one conflated question into the two the spec actually asks.

### 1. `TypeOracle.wellKnownSymbolMemberOf` (`src/checker/oracle.ts`)

The gate needs "can this value carry `@@split`?", which no existing oracle fact
expresses (`factOfType` returns a bare `{kind:"object"}` with no shape). Rather
than reach for the raw checker in `src/codegen/**` — which is exactly what the
#1930/#3273 ratchet exists to stop — the question is added to the oracle, where
it belongs. It is **tri-state on purpose**:

- `true` — present (`RegExp` carries all five);
- `false` — **provably** absent (every constituent resolved, none declared it);
- `undefined` — unknowable (`any`/`unknown`, or a union with such a part).

Only a provable `false` licenses the ToString path. TypeScript models
`[Symbol.split]` as a late-bound property with escaped name `__@split@<declId>`
(bare `__@split` in some ambient shapes); both spellings are matched. No checker
object escapes, so this respects the oracle's no-leak contract. **The change-set
adds zero `getTypeAtLocation`/`ctx.checker` sites under `src/codegen/**`, so no
`oracle-ratchet-allow` is claimed.**

### 2. `isPlainToStringSearchValue` (`src/codegen/regexp-standalone.ts`)

The shared admissibility predicate. Deliberately conservative in three places,
each of which is a correctness requirement rather than caution:

- **`undefined`/`void` is excluded**, and routed by a separate predicate
  `isDefinitelyUndefinedExpr`. Every method special-cases an undefined search
  value *differently*: `split(undefined)` returns `[S]` **without splitting**,
  while `search(undefined)` builds the **empty** pattern. Folding them together
  would be a silent wrong answer. `isDefinitelyUndefinedExpr` also widens the
  pre-existing purely-syntactic test to any expression whose type is exactly
  `undefined`/`void` — test262 writes an undefined separator as
  `function(){}()` (S15.5.4.14_A1_T9), which the syntactic test misses.
- **`symbol` stays refused** — §7.1.17 `ToString(symbol)` throws, and this lane
  cannot raise it (same carve-out as #3724).
- **`any`/`unknown` stay refused.** The single exception is a *syntactic* `null`
  literal, which is `any` under `strictNullChecks: false` yet is unambiguously
  the null value, and `null` skips the protocol lookup by inspection.

### 3. `search` / `match` — `RegExpCreate(ToString(arg), "")` at runtime

`emitCoercedRegExpToLocal` builds the regex through the existing runtime pattern
compiler and parks it in a local. `emitRegexSearchCall` /
`emitRegexExecArrayCall` gain a `regexpOverride` option, symmetric with the
`inputOverride` that was already there, so the shared emitters are reused
untouched rather than duplicated.

The override exists **for evaluation order**, not just for plumbing. The spec
runs `ToString(this)` (step 3) *before* `RegExpCreate` (step 4) evaluates the
search value's `toString`, and both can be observable. The shared emitter loads
the regex first, so both operands are materialised into locals by the caller,
at the caller's chosen point, and the emitter only ever sees `local.get`s.

A coerced regex is non-global by construction, so `match` always takes the
`.exec`-shaped arm; static group/`d`-flag recovery is skipped outright rather
than being trusted to decline on a search-value expression that is not a regex
source at all.

### 4. `split` — `ToString(separator)` into the existing native helper

The new arm mirrors the string-like arm operand-for-operand (receiver →
separator → limit) so **argument** evaluation stays left-to-right as at any call
site; the only difference is `emitArgAsNativeString` (the #2598 ToString engine)
in place of the raw `compileExpression`, which would feed a mistyped ref to a
helper expecting `ref $AnyString`.

*Not* changed: the spec coerces `ToUint32(limit)` (step 4) before
`ToString(separator)` (step 5), which is the reverse of the operand order here.
Reordering the two coercions would require holding an un-coerced arbitrary value
across the limit coercion; more importantly it would invert **argument**
evaluation for `s.split(f(), g())`, trading a non-observable deviation for an
observable one. The existing string-separator arm already ships this order, so
this arm introduces no new deviation. No file in the population distinguishes
the two orders (the `-throws` variants throw under either).

The undefined-separator arm now also **evaluates and discards** a non-syntactic
separator expression. It matched only side-effect-free syntactic forms before;
with the type-level widening it can match `f()`, and folding the value away must
not delete the call.

## Test Results

Instrument validated in both directions before the change, on the harness used
for every number below (`runTest262File(..., "standalone")` — **status only**;
its error category and line are not the CI path, and it does not apply the
#2961 host-import refusal):

- **Positive control** — 6 files the baseline records as standalone `pass` in
  `String/prototype`: **6 / 6 pass**.
- **Negative control / kill-switch-removed measurement** — the 43 goal-scope
  population files on unmodified `upstream/main`: **0 / 43**, all 43 failing
  with exactly this refusal. This is the attribution proof: the "before" arm is
  the same harness, same corpus, same files, with the change absent.

Node was used as the oracle for every hand-written probe **before** it was run
against the compiler.

### Flips

| Set | before | after |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Goal-scope population (43) | 0 | **31** |
| — `search` (15) | 0 | 13 |
| — `match` (11) | 0 | 9 |
| — `split` (9) | 0 | 9 |
| — `replace` (8, deliberately out of scope) | 0 | 0 |

31 of 43 population files, i.e. **31 of the 35 files in the three lanes this
change addresses (89 %)**. The 4 residuals are all the same shape: an
argument whose static type is `any` (`var x;` used before its declaration —
S15.5.4.10/12_A1_T6) — the documented conservative boundary of
`wellKnownSymbolMemberOf`.

**File counts are not flip ceilings** and this one is unusually high because the
population was cut by a Tier-1 refusal string: every member is *conclusively*
gated on this one mechanism, so the usual "gated ≠ reachable" discount (the
project's measured reference point is 103 reachable → 34 flipped) largely does
not apply here.

## Deliberately out of scope

- **`replace` / `replaceAll` string-coercion** — blocked on function replacers
  (see refutation 4 above), a separate pre-existing defect. Follow-up.
- **`matchAll` string-coercion** — needs `RegExpCreate(x, "g")` plus the
  iterator result shape, and §22.1.3.14 makes a non-global regexp argument a
  runtime `TypeError`, which this lane has no path for yet.
- **The `cstm-*` symbol-protocol arm (~40 files, 0 in goal scope)** — genuine
  `GetMethod` dispatch on an arbitrary object. Different mechanism, different
  cost; it is the reason this issue's title says *search-value*, not *RegExp*.

## Implementation note — where this code lives (LOC ratchet, #3102/#3131)

The first green-CI attempt at this fix failed `quality` step 12: the LOC-regrowth
ratchet, with `regexp-standalone.ts` +255 over its base and `string-ops.ts` +55.
It was resolved by **extraction, with no `loc-budget-allow:` granted** — both
files now land *below* their base sizes (regexp-standalone 4,516 → 3,519;
string-ops 3,850 → 3,735).

**Why extraction was the right answer and not an allowance.** The refusal this
issue removes (#1474: "not a statically-known RegExp ⇒ needs a JS host") was only
ever statable at one layer — the point where a `String.prototype` method decides
whether to dispatch `@@<protocol>` or fall through to `ToString`. That layer had
no module of its own; it was ~800 lines sitting inside the *engine* file, so the
new predicate had nowhere to go but on top of a god-file. The growth was a
symptom of the missing seam, which is exactly what the ratchet is designed to
surface.

`src/codegen/regexp-string-methods.ts` now owns that layer:

| stays in `regexp-standalone.ts` (the engine) | moves to `regexp-string-methods.ts` (the protocol bridge) |
| --- | --- |
| pattern → bytecode, `$NativeRegExp` struct | `String.prototype.search`/`match`/`matchAll`/`replace`/`split` |
| `RegExp.prototype.test` / `.exec` | `RegExp.prototype[@@match\|@@replace\|@@search\|@@split]` |
| reflection getters, `lastIndex` | `isPlainToStringSearchValue` + the `RegExpCreate(ToString(x))` emitters |

Dependency direction is one-way (bridge → engine); 18 engine internals became
`export`. `staticRegExpFlags` deliberately stayed behind — `.test`/`.exec` need
it too, and moving it would have created a cycle.

Two things worth knowing for anyone auditing this:

- **The move is byte-identical.** All 994 moved lines were verified verbatim
  against the pre-move file; the only genuinely new function is
  `tryCompileNativeStringSplit`.
- **That one function unified all three `split` arms**, which had been three
  adjacent `if` blocks in `string-ops.ts` duplicating the receiver/limit
  sequence. They are one decision — §22.1.3.23 step 2, "can this separator carry
  `@@split`?" — so they are now one function, and the `string-ops.ts` growth
  disappeared as a side effect rather than being bought off.
