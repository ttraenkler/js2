origin: surfaced after #1213 fixed the snapshot step — the `refresh-benchmarks` workflow now reaches the regression gate, which fires on every PR because the committed baseline (generated locally) is 4× faster than CI candidates (shared runners).

# #1214 — Playground benchmark baseline drifts on CI runners

## Symptom

After #1213 fixed the snapshot step, every PR's `refresh-benchmarks` job now fails at **"Fail on performance regressions"**. Example from PR #105 (a YAML-only change that cannot affect compiled wasm):

```
loop.ts: ratio dropped 61.5% and wasm slowed by 298.1%
  ratio 0.95x → 0.36x | wasm 643.64us → 2562.03us | js 610.38us → 935.04us
```

Both wasm AND js slowed (js +53%, wasm +298%) → underlying machine difference, not a compiler change.

## Root cause

The committed baseline at `benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json` was generated **locally** on a fast dev machine (per `pre-push` hook described in `package.json` `refresh:benchmarks` script). CI runs the same benchmarks on **shared GitHub Actions runners** which are:

- Slower CPUs (often older Intel/AMD vs local Apple Silicon or modern x86)
- Noisier scheduling (shared with other jobs, no isolation guarantees)
- Variable across runs (different runner allocations)

Result: every PR sees "regressions" relative to the local baseline, even when the PR is mathematically incapable of affecting compiled output (YAML-only, doc-only, etc).

The diff thresholds:
- `--max-relative-regression 0.50` — 50% ratio drop
- `--max-wasm-slowdown 0.40` — 40% wasm slowdown

These were tuned for local-vs-local comparison, not local-vs-CI.

## Fix options

### A. Generate baseline on CI (preferred — matches test262 pattern)

After every push to `main`, the `benchmark-refresh.yml` workflow already runs. Add a "promote" step that commits the freshly generated `playground-benchmark-sidebar.json` back to main (similar to `test262-sharded.yml`'s `promote-baseline` job).

Pros: baseline numbers match CI runner characteristics → diff is meaningful.
Cons: more workflow complexity; requires `contents: write` token (already present).

### B. Loosen thresholds for CI

Bump to `--max-wasm-slowdown 4.0` (i.e. 400% allowed slowdown) so the gate only fires on truly catastrophic regressions.

Pros: trivial 1-line change.
Cons: gate becomes nearly useless — only catches multi-x slowdowns.

### C. Ratio-only gating

Drop the absolute wasm slowdown check entirely. Compare only the **wasm:js ratio** — this normalizes against runner speed since both runtimes are affected equally by CPU speed.

Pros: machine-speed-invariant.
Cons: loses signal if wasm AND js both regress proportionally (rare in practice — JS is the JIT, wasm changes affect only one side).

### D. Skip diff entirely when running on PR

Wrap the regression gate in an `if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'`. Only run the gate on push-to-main, where it can promote the new baseline.

Pros: no false positives on PRs.
Cons: regressions caught only after merge. Can be combined with A.

## Recommendation

**A + C combined**:
1. Generate baseline on CI per push to main (eliminates machine-difference drift)
2. Switch primary gate to ratio-only (machine-speed invariant)
3. Keep `benchmark-regression-approved` label for manual override

This makes the gate meaningful again, supporting a "local development & CI both work" workflow.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `refresh-benchmarks` passes on PRs that don't touch compiler source
- [ ] `refresh-benchmarks` still fails (or warns) on PRs that genuinely regress wasm performance
- [ ] Committed baseline reflects CI-typical numbers (not local dev machine)
- [ ] Mechanism documented in `.github/workflows/benchmark-refresh.yml` and in CLAUDE.md baseline files table
- [ ] `benchmark-regression-approved` label still works as escape hatch

## Out of scope

- Cross-runtime benchmark suite (just playground sidebar bench for now)
- Per-benchmark variance analysis (variance is acknowledged as runner noise)
- Wasm size regression gate (separate from timing, separate issue)

## Implementation notes

### Decision: scoped fix (skip gate on PR/push), defer architectural fix

After deeper analysis I rejected my original recommendation of "A + C combined":

- **Option C (ratio-only gating) does not work alone**. Empirical evidence from
  PR #105 and PR #107 (both docs/YAML-only changes that cannot affect compiled
  output) showed the ratio dropped from 0.95x to 0.36x — a 61.5% drop. This is
  because on CI runners wasm slowed 4× while js only slowed 1.5×. The two
  runtimes are NOT affected proportionally by CPU-speed differences: wasm is
  more sensitive to scheduler/cache variance than the V8 JIT. So the ratio is
  not a machine-speed-invariant signal.
- **Option A (auto-commit baseline on push-to-main) is the right fix**, but it
  is a multi-part change (token-permissions, [skip ci] tag, guard against
  committing regressed baselines). Done in this PR, it would couple two
  independent concerns.

The implementation in this PR is the **minimum viable fix**:

- The "Fail on performance regressions" step is split into two:
  - "Print performance regressions" — runs on every event with regressions,
    informational only (visible in the workflow summary)
  - "Fail on performance regressions (workflow_dispatch only)" — gates the
    workflow only when manually triggered with `allow_performance_regressions=false`
- On `pull_request` and `push: main` events, the workflow no longer fails on
  benchmark regressions. The dashboard data still gets regenerated.
- The `benchmark-regression-approved` label is retained for backward
  compatibility but is no longer required (PRs no longer trigger the gate).
- Architectural follow-up (option A): tracked separately. After this fix lands,
  a future PR can add the auto-commit-baseline-on-push-to-main step. With the
  baseline regenerated on every main push, the gate could be re-enabled on PRs
  meaningfully — but that's not in scope here.

### Why not full option A in this PR?

- Auto-committing benchmark numbers from CI requires careful coordination with
  the existing `refresh-committed-baseline.yml` and `test262-sharded.yml`
  promote-baseline patterns. Doing it half-way introduces a new failure mode
  without resolving the original one.
- The gate firing on every PR creates immediate friction (~10 minutes of
  human-attention per merge for drift override). The fix above eliminates that
  friction in one line.
- A follow-up PR can add option A with proper commit-loop guarding ([skip ci],
  no-op-detection, regression-aware skip) and dedicated tests. That's a
  distinct architectural change deserving its own review.

### Verification approach

PR CI on this branch should show `refresh-benchmarks` succeed (or at least
the regression-fail step skipped) even when the diff reports the same
loop.ts machine-difference noise. The workflow logs will still print the
diff, so a reviewer can manually inspect for actually concerning movements.
