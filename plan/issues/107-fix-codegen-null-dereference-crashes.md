# Issue 107: Fix codegen null-dereference crashes (90 occurrences)

## Summary

The most frequent compile error across test262 is an internal codegen crash:

```
Codegen error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type')
```

This accounts for **90 distinct test file failures**. The crash happens when codegen
attempts to read a property (most commonly `.type`) from a node that is `undefined`.

## Example files

- `test/language/expressions/assignmenttargettype/simple-complex-callexpression-expression.js`
- `test/language/expressions/assignmenttargettype/simple-complex-memberexpression-*.js`

## Root cause investigation

The `assignmenttargettype` category tests that various expression forms are valid
(or invalid) as assignment targets. The tests call the assignment target with
`callexpression`, `memberexpression`, etc. patterns. When codegen walks these
assignment targets, it likely encounters a node shape it doesn't expect and
dereferences `undefined`.

Likely suspects:
- `genAssignment` or `genLValue` hitting an unexpected `CallExpression` on the
  left-hand side of an assignment
- `genExpression` called on a node whose `.type` field is missing or whose
  surrounding context is `undefined` after a failed lookup

## Approach

1. `grep -r "Cannot read properties of undefined" src/` to find where errors surface
2. Add a specific test reproducer from one of the failing files
3. Add null/undefined guards at the identified call sites, or emit a structured
   `compile_error` instead of crashing
4. Rerun `tests/test262-errors.test.ts` to verify the crash count drops
