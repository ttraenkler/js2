# Issue #314: Performance -- compile time profiling and optimization

## Status: in-review
## Summary
As the compiler handles more test262 tests, compile time becomes important. Profile the compilation pipeline to identify bottlenecks and optimize the slowest phases (type checking, scope analysis, codegen, Wasm validation).

## Category
Sprint 5 / Group D

## Complexity: M

## Scope
- Add timing instrumentation to major compilation phases
- Profile the test262 suite compilation time
- Identify the top 3 performance bottlenecks
- Implement optimizations for the worst bottleneck
- Measure improvement

## Acceptance criteria
- Compilation pipeline has timing instrumentation
- At least one measurable performance improvement
- Document findings in benchmarks/

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added per-test phase-level timing instrumentation to the test262 runner and standalone script.

### Changes

**tests/test262-runner.ts**:
- Added `TestTiming` interface with `totalMs`, `compileMs`, `instantiateMs`, `executeMs` fields
- Added `timing` optional field to `TestResult` interface
- Instrumented `runTest262File()` with `performance.now()` calls around each phase:
  - `compile()` -- the ts2wasm compilation step
  - `WebAssembly.instantiate()` -- Wasm validation and instantiation
  - `testFn()` -- test execution
- Added `round2()` helper to keep timing values readable (2 decimal places)
- Timing is included in all result paths (pass, fail, compile_error) except skip

**scripts/run-test262.ts**:
- Timing data is now included in JSONL output per test
- JSON report includes a new `timing` section with:
  - Aggregate totals (compile, instantiate, execute, wall-clock)
  - Top 20 slowest tests by compile time
  - Top 20 slowest tests by total time
  - Per-category average compile time (top 30)
- Console output includes a new "Compilation Timing" section showing:
  - Aggregate time breakdown
  - Top 10 slowest tests to compile
  - Top 10 slowest categories by average compile time

### Files changed
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- timing instrumentation in `runTest262File()`
- `scripts/run-test262.ts` -- timing aggregation, reporting, and JSONL output
