# #1058 — Compile the TypeScript compiler to Wasm (self-hosting stress test)

## Goal

Use the actual [`typescript`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) npm package as the **fifth** real-world stress test for js2wasm, alongside #1031 (lodash), #1032 (axios), #1033 (react), and #1034 (prettier). The TypeScript compiler is the ultimate self-hosting milestone: **js2wasm compiling the compiler that js2wasm itself uses as its TypeScript frontend.**

This is distinct from the already-done **#452** ("Compile TypeScript compiler to Wasm"), which was a feasibility study using a hand-written 411-line toy scanner/parser that imitated TypeScript patterns. #452 concluded "95% of TypeScript patterns compile" — necessary validation, but not an attempt on the real thing. This issue is the real attempt.

## Why the TypeScript compiler specifically

- **~500K lines of mature production TypeScript** — biggest real-world corpus anywhere (vs 17K lodash, ~100K prettier, ~70K react, ~7K axios)
- **Exercises every language feature simultaneously** — parser, binder, type checker, emitter, language service, incremental compiler, module resolution
- **Self-hosting signal is the strongest correctness test possible**. If js2wasm compiles tsc, and compiled-tsc can then compile a non-trivial `.ts` file that matches native-tsc's output, that's a full round-trip semantic check of every path the compiler uses itself
- **No DOM, no Node builtins beyond `node:fs`** — clean host-import boundary (same approach as axios #1032 + WASI #1035 + #1044)
- **Recursive AST traversal + visitor pattern at massive scale** — surfaces every latent codegen issue
- **Huge switch statements on `SyntaxKind`** — hundreds of cases per binder/checker/emitter function; stresses large-switch codegen
- **Known challenges embedded:** template literals with `${}` interpolation (the 1/20 failure in #452), complex conditional/mapped types, recursive type definitions, AST node pool lifetime

## The moonshot — tiered acceptance

Escalating difficulty:

1. **Tier 1 (pattern validation — already done in #452):** TypeScript-compiler-shaped patterns compile. ✅ 19/20
2. **Tier 2 (real compiler leaves):** individual source files from `typescript/src/compiler/` compile without modification
3. **Tier 3 (scanner + parser):** compile `typescript/src/compiler/scanner.ts` + `parser.ts` so the resulting Wasm parses simple `.ts` source to an AST
4. **Tier 4 (checker subset):** compile enough of `checker.ts` to type-check `1 + "str"` and report a type error
5. **Tier 5 (emit):** compile enough of `emitter.ts` to emit a `.js` file from a compiled AST
6. **Tier 6 (full round-trip):** compile a tsc subset end-to-end; hand it a `.ts` file, produce a `.js` file that matches native-tsc byte-for-byte (parallel to prettier's self-format diff #1034)
7. **Tier 7 — the moonshot (self-hosting):** compile js2wasm's own source with compiled-tsc and verify the second-stage js2wasm still compiles test262 correctly

**Tier 7 is aspirational. Tier 3 is the realistic sprint target. Tier 4 is the headline win.**

## Hard prerequisites

This issue depends on:

- **#1042 async/await state-machine lowering** — TypeScript's incremental compiler and project references use `async` extensively. Without real async, Tier 3+ is blocked.
- **#1044 Node builtin modules as host imports** — TypeScript uses `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:util`, `node:crypto`. Required for loading the compiler's own source files from disk.
- **#1046 separate ES-module compilation with consumer-driven type specialization** — TypeScript's source is split across ~300 ES modules with a complex import graph. Current whole-program compile won't scale; this is a hard architectural blocker for Tier 2+.

Soft prerequisites (not strict blockers but would improve realization rate):

- **Template literal with `${}` interpolation** — #452's only known pattern gap. TypeScript uses these in hundreds of places for error message formatting
- **Large switch codegen scaling** — `binder.ts`, `emitter.ts`, and `checker.ts` each have switch statements with 200+ `SyntaxKind` cases. Our codegen currently emits linear if/else chains — won't fit
- **Recursive generic types** — `ts.Type`, `ts.Node`, `ts.Symbol` are deeply recursive with polymorphic `parent: Node | undefined` chains. If WasmGC struct layout doesn't support this cleanly, we hit walls in Tier 2
- **BigInt** — TypeScript uses BigInt in a few places (checksum/hash); not critical but breaks some modules

## Approach

### Step 1 — Start with leaf modules

Before touching the real compiler, pick the smallest self-contained files in `typescript/src/compiler/` with minimal external dependencies. Candidates:

- `typescript/src/compiler/core.ts` — pure utility functions (mapping, hashing, string helpers)
- `typescript/src/compiler/path.ts` — path manipulation (pure string operations)
- `typescript/src/compiler/debug.ts` — debug assertions
- `typescript/src/compiler/performance.ts` — performance instrumentation

Start with `core.ts` or `path.ts`. These are leaf dependencies with minimal external surface.

### Step 2 — Build a harness

Create `scripts/ts-compiler-stress.ts`:

```ts
import { compile } from '../src/index.ts';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

const tiers = {
  t2_leaf: [
    'node_modules/typescript/src/compiler/core.ts',
    'node_modules/typescript/src/compiler/path.ts',
  ],
  t3_scanner_parser: [
    'node_modules/typescript/src/compiler/scanner.ts',
    'node_modules/typescript/src/compiler/parser.ts',
  ],
  t4_checker_subset: [
    'node_modules/typescript/src/compiler/checker.ts',
  ],
  t5_emitter_subset: [
    'node_modules/typescript/src/compiler/emitter.ts',
  ],
};

for (const [tier, files] of Object.entries(tiers)) {
  console.log(`=== ${tier} ===`);
  for (const file of files) {
    const src = readFileSync(file, 'utf-8');
    const result = await compile(src, {
      fileName: file,
      esModulesAsHostImports: true,
      nodeBuiltinsAsHostImports: true,
    });
    console.log(result.success ? `  OK   ${file}` : `  FAIL ${file}: ${result.errors[0]?.message?.slice(0, 100)}`);
  }
}
```

### Step 3 — Categorize failures

Same as other stress tests (#1031-#1034): cluster by pattern, sample 2-3 per bucket, file follow-up issues for each concentrated cluster. Expected top buckets:

- Large switch dispatch codegen failures
- Template literal with interpolation (known #452 gap)
- Recursive generic types in declarations
- Module graph compile errors once #1046 lands
- New AST node kinds used internally by TypeScript that js2wasm doesn't handle

### Step 4 — The partial-compile validation

Once Tier 3 compiles (scanner + parser), build an incremental end-to-end test:

```ts
const compiledTs = await loadCompiledTypescript();
const sampleSource = 'const x: number = 1 + 2;';
const compiledAst = compiledTs.parseSource(sampleSource);
const nativeAst = ts.createSourceFile('sample.ts', sampleSource, ts.ScriptTarget.Latest);
assertASTEqual(compiledAst, nativeAst);
```

If compiled scanner+parser produces the same AST as native TypeScript for a set of representative input files, Tier 3 passes.

### Step 5 — Follow-up issues

Expected 5-15 new follow-up issues from Tier 2-3, each scoped narrowly enough for one sprint (one PR).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `scripts/ts-compiler-stress.ts` exists and runs against a local `typescript` install
- [ ] Tier 2 (leaf modules: `core.ts`, `path.ts`) compiles cleanly
- [ ] Tier 3 attempted — even a partial compile produces valuable error data
- [ ] ≥ 5 follow-up issues filed for concrete gap patterns
- [ ] Results document the real-package compile rate, not hand-written toy subset (supersedes #452's scope)
- [ ] **Stretch 1 (Tier 3):** compiled scanner+parser produces AST shape-equivalent to native ts for ≥ 3 real `.ts` files
- [ ] **Stretch 2 (Tier 4):** compiled checker subset detects `1 + "str"` as a type error
- [ ] **Moonshot (Tier 7):** js2wasm-compiled tsc can compile js2wasm's own source, and the second-stage output passes test262 at the same rate

## Non-goals

- Full TypeScript compatibility — stress test / correctness harvest, not reimplementation
- Compiling the language service (`typescript/lib/tsserver.js`) — out of scope
- Performance parity with native tsc — correctness first
- Incremental compilation state across runs — the real tsc caches; we don't need that for single-shot
- Type-checker edge cases even native TypeScript struggles with (infinite conditional types, deeply nested `infer`)

## Design notes

**Why this is harder than prettier (#1034).**

Prettier is a pure source-to-source transformer whose acceptance test is "compiled output == native output byte-for-byte" — a mechanical diff. TypeScript is a type checker whose acceptance test is "compiled checker arrives at the same type assignments as native checker" — a semantic test over a graph of Type nodes, not a string diff. Much harder to verify, much more informative when it passes.

**Why this is easier than it looks.**

TypeScript compiles itself every day at Microsoft. The code is battle-tested. If a pattern works in real tsc, it's a pattern we *should* handle. Every failure in our compile is a concrete bug in js2wasm, not ambiguous tooling interaction. Unambiguous feedback: either we handle TypeScript's idioms or we don't.

**Self-hosting is the ultimate integration test.**

Every compiler gap today hides behind test262 or equivalence abstractions. Self-hosting breaks that — if we can't compile our own frontend, we know *exactly* which path is broken because tsc compiled that path a million times before. Strongest correctness signal available.

**Relationship to #452.**

#452 proved feasibility at the *pattern* level — 19/20 TypeScript idioms compile. This issue is the implementation at the *codebase* level — real modules, real call graphs, real type definitions. Complementary: #452 said "the puzzle pieces fit," this issue says "now build the puzzle."

**Why backlog-level dependency on #1046.**

TypeScript's source is split across ~300 ES modules with an intricate import graph. Current `compile(src, options)` assumes whole-program input. #1046 (separate ES-module compilation) is the architectural enabler that lets each file compile against declared imports without inlining the entire graph. Until #1046 is at least partially landed, Tier 2+ is blocked on "can we even load the second file."

## Related

Fifth in the real-world stress-test set:
- **#1031 lodash** — pure compute (generic algorithms)
- **#1032 axios** — I/O, Node host imports
- **#1033 react** — closures, hooks, DOM host imports
- **#1034 prettier** — parsers, recursive AST, string-heavy, self-format diff
- **#1058 TypeScript (this)** — self-hosting, type checking, everything at once

**Supersedes the scope of #452** (pattern-level feasibility study, #452 stays in done/ as historical validation).
**Depends on** #1042 (async/await), #1044 (Node builtins as host imports), #1046 (separate ES-module compilation).
**Soft dependencies:** template literal interpolation, large-switch codegen, recursive type inference.
**Unlocks:** ultimate self-hosting milestone, concrete stewardship-pitch deliverable ("js2wasm compiles tsc").

## Stewardship angle

"js2wasm compiles 60% of test262" is a percentage. "js2wasm compiles the TypeScript compiler itself" is a story. Landing even Tier 3 is the single strongest artifact for conversations with potential maintainers or funders — it demonstrates the compiler has enough depth to handle production TypeScript, not just hand-picked benchmark inputs. The gap between "a toy subset compiles" and "the real compiler compiles" is exactly what separates a proof-of-concept from a usable tool.
