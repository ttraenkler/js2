# #1072 — Return-type coercion f64 → externref missing in bundled JS call site

## Problem

`node_modules/prettier/doc.mjs` compiles successfully (107KB binary
produced, `result.success === true`) but the resulting Wasm binary fails
`WebAssembly.instantiate` with:

```
WebAssembly.instantiate(): Compiling function #55:"trimNewlinesEnd" failed:
  call[0] expected type externref, found call of type f64 @+40428
```

`trimNewlinesEnd` is a small helper from prettier's string utils. The
emitted Wasm calls a function whose static return type is `f64`, then uses
the value in a context that expects `externref`, without the required
`__box_number` + `extern.convert_any` coercion.

This is a real codegen bug in the call-expression path: the type-coercion
pass in `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` handles the literal and
argument-passing paths, but the **return-value propagation** path when a
helper returns a numeric value that flows into a string-typed position
doesn't run `coerceType` on the call result.

## Context

The `doc.mjs` bundle types `trimNewlinesEnd`'s internal call sites as
returning `any` (inferred in `allowJs` mode), and at the consumer site
the expected type is an externref (string-pool handle). The call result
ends up on the stack as `f64` but the consumer opcode drops into an
`externref` slot without the coercion insertion.

This matches the "f64 → externref" entry in `type-coercion.ts` but the
hook point at the call-expression emit site is missing for JS-host
`any`-typed call sites.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `prettier/doc.mjs` compiled binary passes `WebAssembly.validate`
- [ ] `prettier/doc.mjs` successfully instantiates under `buildImports`
- [ ] A minimal repro (`tests/issue-1070.test.ts`) reproduces the failure
      with a small `function f(s: any): any { return s.length; }` + string
      consumer pattern
- [ ] `coerceType` is invoked on the call-expression result when the
      consumer's expected type is externref but the emitted stack type is
      numeric

## Notes

- Surfaced by #1034 prettier stress run, 2026-04-11
- Report: `plan/log/issues/1034-report.md`
- Touches `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` at the post-emit coerce hook
  and `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` for the return-value propagation case
- **This is the first concrete runtime-validation failure from a real-world
  library stress test** — high signal value, blocks prettier
  self-instantiation entirely
