# #630 — Temporal API tests fail (888 FAIL)

## Status: in-review
888 tests from built-ins/Temporal fail. Temporal is a newer TC39 proposal (Stage 3) for date/time handling. Not currently implemented in the compiler.

### Fix
Low priority — Temporal is not yet shipping in all engines. These tests inflate the fail count but aren't blocking real-world code.

Added `"Temporal"` to the `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES` set in the test262 runner. This skips all 888 Temporal tests honestly (they are tagged with the `Temporal` feature in test262 metadata) rather than letting them inflate the failure count.

## Complexity: S (skip filter addition)

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added `"Temporal"` to the `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES` set in `tests/test262-runner.ts`. Tests tagged with the `Temporal` feature will now be skipped with a clear reason (`unsupported feature: Temporal`) rather than producing 888 runtime errors.

### Files changed
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` — added `"Temporal"` to `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES`

### Rationale
Temporal is a Stage 3 TC39 proposal. Full implementation is out of scope for the compiler. Skipping these tests is the honest approach: it reduces noise in the failure count and makes the remaining failures more actionable.
