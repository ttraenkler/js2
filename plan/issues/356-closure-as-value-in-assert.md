# #356 -- Closure-as-value in assert and array-like objects

## Status: in-progress

106 tests: 51 pass closures as values to assert helpers, 55 use array-like object literals with numeric keys. Both need better externref handling.

## Details

### Closure-as-value (51 tests)
Tests pass function references as values to assertion helpers:
```javascript
var f = function() {};
assert.sameValue(obj.method, f);
```

This requires functions to be comparable as values (reference equality) and passable through externref boundaries.

### Array-like objects (55 tests)
Tests create array-like objects with numeric string keys:
```javascript
var obj = {0: "a", 1: "b", length: 2};
```

These need to work with Array.prototype methods via .call() and with property access using numeric indices.

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Function references can be compared for equality
- [x] Functions can be passed through assert helpers
- [ ] Array-like object literals work with numeric keys (not addressed -- 0 tests pass currently)
- [x] Previously skipped closure tests are now attempted (59 tests unskipped, 23 now pass)
