# #1091 — Early error detection: 94 tests compile when they should throw SyntaxError

## Problem

94 test262 tests are marked as `negative: {phase: parse, type: SyntaxError}`
or `negative: {phase: early, type: SyntaxError}` but our compiler accepts
them, produces a Wasm binary, and instantiates it successfully. The test262
runner then reports "expected parse/early SyntaxError but compiled and
instantiated successfully."

These are spec-mandated early errors — the compiler MUST reject them at
compile time. Accepting them is a conformance failure that could also mask
downstream runtime bugs.

## ECMAScript spec reference

- Each grammar production has its own **Static Semantics: Early Errors** section — e.g., [§13.1.1](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-expression-statement-static-semantics-early-errors), [§15.7.1](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-class-definitions-static-semantics-early-errors)
- The compiler must detect these at parse/compile time and throw SyntaxError before execution


## Root cause

The compiler's early-error pass (`src/checker/` or wherever `detectEarlyErrors`
lives) doesn't cover all spec-mandated static semantics. Likely missing:

1. **Duplicate formal parameters in strict mode** — `function f(a, a) {}`
   is a SyntaxError in strict mode but our compiler may accept it
2. **`delete` on unqualified identifier in strict mode** — `delete x` is
   a SyntaxError, may be accepted
3. **Assignment to `eval`/`arguments` in strict mode** — `eval = 1` is
   a SyntaxError
4. **Octal literals in strict mode** — `0123` is a SyntaxError
5. **`with` inside strict-mode function** — though `with` is already
   skipped, some edge cases may pass through
6. **Label duplication** — `L: L: ;` is a SyntaxError
7. **`continue`/`break` targeting non-existent label**
8. **`return` outside function body** (in module code)

The TS parser rejects SOME of these, but test262's strict-mode tests often
use sloppy-mode source with `"use strict"` directives, which TS may not
enforce as strictly as the spec requires.

## Affected tests

94 tests across:
- `language/statements/` (majority — strict mode violations)
- `language/expressions/delete/` (delete identifier)
- `language/expressions/assignment/` (assign to eval/arguments)
- `language/module-code/` (top-level return)

Example files:
- `test/language/statements/labeled/value-await-non-module-escaped.js`
- `test/language/expressions/delete/identifier-strict.js`
- `test/language/expressions/assignment/eval-strict.js`
- `test/language/statements/for-in/head-lhs-let.js`
- `test/language/module-code/early-dup-export-id.js`

## Proposed solution

1. Audit the 94 failing test files to cluster them by which early-error
   rule they test (likely 5-8 distinct rules)
2. For each rule cluster, check whether `src/checker/` or `detectEarlyErrors`
   has the check — if missing, add it
3. Some checks may be handleable via TS compiler options (`noImplicitUseStrict`,
   `alwaysStrict`) — verify those are set correctly for test262 strict-mode
   tests
4. For checks that TS handles but our pipeline ignores: check whether
   `ts.Diagnostic` results from `getSemanticDiagnostics()` include these
   early errors and we're just not surfacing them

## Effort estimate

**M** — each early-error rule is typically 5-15 LOC in the checker. The
work is spread across 5-8 distinct rules, each independently testable.
The hard part is identifying exactly which rules are missing, which the
initial audit (step 1) covers. Expect ~100-200 LOC total across
checker + potentially a strict-mode flag propagation fix.
