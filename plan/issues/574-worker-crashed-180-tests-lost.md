# Worker crashed -- 180 tests lost to worker process crashes

## Problem

180 test262 tests report "worker crashed" status, meaning the forked worker
process exited unexpectedly before completing its batch. This is typically caused
by:

1. **OOM**: The default Node.js heap limit (~1.5 GB) is insufficient for tests
   that produce large compiled Wasm modules. When the heap is exhausted, the
   worker process is killed by the OS.

2. **Infinite loops in compilation**: Some tests trigger infinite loops or very
   long-running compilation passes. The existing 30s watchdog only fires when
   *no* results are sent -- if the worker is stuck on one test, all remaining
   tests in the batch are lost.

## Solution

### 1. Increase worker memory limit

Pass `--max-old-space-size=2048` in the `execArgv` when forking workers in
`scripts/run-test262.ts`. This gives each worker 2 GB of heap instead of the
default ~1.5 GB.

### 2. Per-test compilation timeout

Add a 15-second timeout wrapper around `runTest262File` in
`scripts/test262-worker.ts`. If a single test exceeds 15 seconds (compilation +
instantiation + execution), it is reported as a "fail" with a timeout error
message, and the worker moves on to the next test in the batch.

This is distinct from the existing 30s watchdog in the parent process, which
kills the entire worker. The per-test timeout is more surgical -- it catches
individual slow tests without losing the rest of the batch.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added `--max-old-space-size=2048` to worker fork `execArgv` in `scripts/run-test262.ts`
- Added `withTimeout()` helper in `scripts/test262-worker.ts` that wraps each
  `runTest262File` call with a 15-second deadline
- Timeout errors are reported as "fail" (not "compile_error") since the root
  cause is unknown -- could be compilation or execution

### Files changed
- `scripts/run-test262.ts` -- added `--max-old-space-size=2048` to execArgv
- `scripts/test262-worker.ts` -- added `withTimeout()` helper, wrapped both
  batch and legacy single-test paths

### What worked
- Clean separation: per-test timeout in worker, batch-level watchdog in parent
- No changes to test262-runner.ts needed

### What didn't
- N/A -- straightforward infrastructure fix
