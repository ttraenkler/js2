# #943 — Test262 runner instability — 1,400+ pass variance between identical runs

## Outcome

This issue is resolved as a planning item. The original variance alarm was real,
but the root cause was narrowed and the repo no longer treats it as an active
open investigation.

Key conclusions now recorded in [#923](./923.md) and
[sprint-37.md](../../sprints/sprint-37.md):

- the huge variance was **not** a compiler-state leak
- compile idempotency was verified and `_ensureStructPending` was fixed
- the runner path was subsequently reworked around sharded execution and
  baseline diffing
- remaining concrete timeout waste is tracked separately in `#824` and
  `#991` to `#996`

## Why this is done

The umbrella served its purpose:

1. it forced investigation of the variance
2. the suspected compiler-state cause was disproven and fixed/closed under `#923`
3. the remaining runner-specific problems were split into more precise follow-ups

## Acceptance criteria

- compiler state leak explanation is ruled out
- runner variance is no longer left as a vague open umbrella
- remaining runner follow-ups live in narrower issues instead
