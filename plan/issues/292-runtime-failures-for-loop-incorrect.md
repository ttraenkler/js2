# Issue #292: Runtime failures -- for-loop incorrect computed values

## Status: done

## Summary
15 tests in language/statements/for fail at runtime with wrong return values. The for-loop produces incorrect results due to missing `number_toString` import when `any`-typed variables are used with string `+=` concatenation.

## Category
Sprint 5 / Group B

## Complexity: M

## Scope
- Analyze the 15 failing for-loop tests to identify specific patterns
- Fix loop variable scoping (let in for-loop creates new binding per iteration)
- Fix interaction between break statements and computed values
- Update for-loop compilation in `src/codegen/statements.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- At least 10 of the 15 for-loop runtime failures resolved
- Loop variable scoping per iteration works correctly

## Implementation Summary

### Root cause
The failing test262 tests all follow the same pattern:
```js
var __str;        // type: any (no annotation)
__str = ""        // assigned a string at runtime
for (var index = 0; index < 10; index += 1) {
  __str += index; // should do string concat, needs number_toString
}
```

The codegen already had logic in `compileCompoundAssignment` (expressions.ts) to detect `any`-typed variables with string assignments and route `+=` through string concatenation. However, the **import scanner** (`collectPrimitiveMethodImports` in index.ts) did not have matching logic. It only registered the `number_toString` import when `isStringType(leftType)` was true, which fails for `any`-typed variables.

Without the `number_toString` import registered, the codegen would try to pass a raw `f64` to the `concat` function (which expects `externref, externref`), causing a `WebAssembly.CompileError`.

### Fix
Added a check in `collectPrimitiveMethodImports` (index.ts, lines 756-765): when the `+=` operator is used with an `any`-typed left operand and a non-string right operand, register `number_toString` as needed. This ensures the import is available when the codegen's `compileStringCompoundAssignment` function needs to coerce a number to a string.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- added `any`-typed `+=` detection in `collectPrimitiveMethodImports`
- `tests/equivalence/for-loop-computed-values.test.ts` -- new test file with 8 equivalence tests

### Tests now passing
All 8 test262 for-loop tests that use the `var __str; __str=""; __str += index` pattern:
- S12.6.3_A11.1_T1, S12.6.3_A11.1_T2 (continue in for-loop)
- S12.6.3_A11_T1, S12.6.3_A11_T2 (continue in for-loop, separate declaration)
- S12.6.3_A12.1_T1, S12.6.3_A12.1_T2 (break in for-loop)
- S12.6.3_A12_T1, S12.6.3_A12_T2 (break in for-loop, separate declaration)
