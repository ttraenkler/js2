# #481 — Well-known Symbol.iterator as compile-time struct field (1,327 tests)

## Status: in-progress

1,327 tests are skipped because they use `Symbol.iterator` in source code. This is the single largest skip bucket (72% of all Symbol-related skips).

## Approach

WasmGC structs have statically defined fields — no runtime property keys. But `Symbol.iterator` is a **well-known symbol** with a fixed semantic meaning. We can special-case it at compile time:

1. When a class/object defines `[Symbol.iterator]()`, compile it as a regular method with a known field name (e.g. `__symbol_iterator`)
2. When code accesses `obj[Symbol.iterator]`, resolve it to that field at compile time
3. When for-of is used, check for the `__symbol_iterator` field and call it

This is NOT full Symbol support — it's compile-time resolution of a specific well-known symbol. No runtime symbol registry needed.

## Categories affected
- `language/statements/class` (345 tests)
- `language/expressions/class` (344 tests)
- `language/expressions/async-generator` (138 tests)
- `language/expressions/object` (101 tests)
- `language/statements/for-of` (101 tests)
- `language/expressions/assignment` (58 tests)
- Other (200 tests)

## Implementation

1. Add `__symbol_iterator` as a reserved struct field name
2. In class/object codegen, detect `[Symbol.iterator]` computed property and map to `__symbol_iterator`
3. In property access codegen, detect `expr[Symbol.iterator]` and resolve to struct field
4. In for-of codegen, call `__symbol_iterator()` on the target if it has the field
5. Narrow the skip filter: only skip tests that use Symbol for non-iterator purposes

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `class C { [Symbol.iterator]() { ... } }` compiles with iterator method as struct field
- [ ] `for (const x of obj)` uses the compiled iterator method
- [ ] Skip filter narrowed from "uses Symbol in source" to specific non-compilable patterns
- [ ] Unlock 500+ tests (not all 1,327 will pass — many have other issues too)
