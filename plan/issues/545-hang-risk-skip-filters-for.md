# #545: Remove hang-risk skip filters (for-of generators + throw/try)

## Problem

Four skip filters in `shouldSkip()` (test262-runner.ts) block ~139 tests due to
hang risk:

1. **function expression in catch scope** -- matches `try { throw ... catch ... var = function`
2. **nested function/catch scope with type mismatch** -- matches `catch(\w+) ... throw ... function`
3. **member expression as for-of LHS** -- matches `for (obj.prop of ...)`
4. **parenthesized LHS in for-of** -- matches `for ((x) of ...)`

These were added before the test262 worker pool had timeouts. Now that the worker
pool has a 30-second per-test timeout, hangs are safely killed and reported as
timeout failures rather than blocking the entire suite.

## Solution

Remove all four filters. Tests that previously hung will now either:
- Pass (if the underlying issue was fixed)
- Fail with a compile error or runtime error
- Timeout after 30s and be reported as such

## Files Changed

- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- removed 4 skip filters in `shouldSkip()`
