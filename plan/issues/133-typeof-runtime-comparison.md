# #133 — typeof runtime comparison

## Problem
`typeof x === "string"` doesn't work at runtime. The compiler can resolve `typeof` at compile-time for known types, but when the variable is `any` or a union, runtime typeof dispatch is needed.

## Scope
- `typeof x` where x is `any` — need runtime type tag check
- `typeof x === "number"`, `"string"`, `"boolean"`, `"object"`, `"undefined"`, `"function"`, `"bigint"`
- Skip filter: "uses typeof with string comparison"

## Implementation
- For boxed `any` values: check the type tag field of the any-value struct
- For known types: continue to resolve at compile time
- For externref: use host import or tag-based dispatch
- Comparison `typeof x === "string"` can be compiled to a tag check + i32 result
