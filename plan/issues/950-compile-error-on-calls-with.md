# #950 -- Compile error on calls with fewer arguments than TS signature expects

## Problem

When the TypeScript checker reports "Expected N arguments, but got M" (M < N), the compiler treats this as a hard compile error and refuses to compile the function. In JavaScript, calling a function with fewer arguments is perfectly valid — missing positional arguments become `undefined`.

This blocks compilation of real-world code like `game-loop.ts` (THREE.js game loop) where:
- Functions from unresolved external imports get wrong TS-inferred parameter counts
- Callbacks and event handlers are called with fewer args than their full signature
- Optional parameters without `?` annotation still receive fewer args at call sites

### Example

```typescript
// TS checker: "Expected 4 arguments, but got 3"
// But JS semantics: 4th arg is just `undefined`
renderer.setViewport(x, y, width);  // height defaults to undefined
```

Currently produces: `Expected 4 arguments, but got 3.` → compile error.

## Proposed fix

When the compiler encounters a call with fewer arguments than the TS signature expects:
1. Do NOT treat the TS checker error as a hard compile error
2. Emit the provided arguments normally
3. For each missing positional argument, emit the appropriate default value:
   - `externref` → `ref.null.extern`
   - `f64` → `f64.const NaN` (matches JS `undefined` → `NaN` coercion)
   - `i32` → `i32.const 0` (matches JS `undefined` → `0` for integer context)
   - `ref`/`ref_null` → `ref.null` of the appropriate type

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Calls with fewer args than expected compile successfully (no CE)
- [ ] Missing args receive appropriate default values matching JS semantics
- [ ] `game-loop.ts` equivalence test passes compilation
- [ ] No regression in test pass count
