# Issue #246: For-of object destructuring -- TypeError on primitive coercion

## Status: in-review
## Summary

5 tests in `language/statements/for-of/dstr/` fail with "TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value". These tests destructure objects from arrays in for-of loops, like `for (var {x = 1} of [{y: 2}]) {}`. The runtime attempts to convert the object to a primitive value, which fails.

## Root Cause

In `compileForOfDestructuring`, when a destructuring pattern requests a field that doesn't exist in the struct (e.g., `{x = 1}` from `{y: 2}`), the codegen was emitting an error and skipping the binding entirely. This left the local variable uninitialized, and no default value was ever compiled. The "TypeError" came from the JS host when the uninitialized externref value was used in arithmetic operations.

## Fix

Modified `compileForOfDestructuring` in `src/codegen/statements.ts` to handle missing struct fields gracefully:

1. When a destructured field doesn't exist in the struct and a default value is provided, compile and assign the default value directly
2. When no default value is provided, emit the appropriate "undefined" sentinel (NaN for f64, 0 for i32, ref.null for externref)
3. The local is still allocated with the correct type inferred from the TS binding element

## Scope

- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- for-of destructuring handling (compileForOfDestructuring)
- `tests/equivalence.test.ts` -- 3 new tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] For-of with object destructuring does not coerce objects to primitives
- [x] Missing properties use default values correctly
- [x] 3 new equivalence tests pass

## Complexity: S
