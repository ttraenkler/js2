# Issue 25: Fix f32.const opcode in binary emitter

## Status: done

## Summary
The binary emitter uses the `f64_const` opcode for `f32.const` instructions. This is a bug — it should use the f32 opcode (`0x43`).

## Motivation
If f32 types are ever generated (e.g. for typed arrays or performance-critical code), the binary output would be invalid. Currently not triggered because the type mapper only generates f64, but this is a latent bug.

## Scope
- `src/emit/binary.ts` — fix opcode selection for `f32.const`
- `src/emit/opcodes.ts` — verify `f32_const` opcode exists (0x43)

## Complexity: XS

## Acceptance criteria
- `f32.const` emits opcode `0x43` followed by 4-byte IEEE 754 float, not `0x44` with 8-byte double
