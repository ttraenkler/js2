# Issue #394: Destructuring produces wrong return values

## Problem

1438 tests compile but return wrong results (updated 2026-03-16: "returned 0" is now 1438 deduped, was 326). Two root causes identified:

1. **Object destructuring type mismatch**: `compileObjectDestructuring` used the TS checker
   to resolve the struct type, but when the initializer was an anonymous object literal,
   the TS checker returned a different `ts.Type` object than what `compileExpression` used,
   producing a different anonymous struct type index. This caused `struct.get` to use a
   mismatched type, producing a WebAssembly compile error.

2. **Interface fields stored as externref**: `collectInterface` used `mapTsTypeToWasm` which
   returns `externref` for all Object types (since it doesn't have access to struct registry).
   This meant interface fields referencing other interfaces (e.g., `Outer.inner: Inner`)
   were typed as `externref` instead of `ref $Inner`, breaking nested destructuring.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done

1. **Fixed `compileObjectDestructuring` in `statements.ts`**: When `resultType` from
   `compileExpression` is a ref type, use its `typeIdx` to look up the struct name/fields
   directly, rather than going through the TS checker. Falls back to the original TS
   checker path if `resultType` doesn't provide a struct.

2. **Added `resolveStructFieldTypes` in `index.ts`**: After all interfaces and type aliases
   are collected in the pre-pass, a second resolution pass re-resolves any `externref` fields
   that should be `ref $struct` using `resolveWasmType` (which has access to `ctx.structMap`).
   This handles cross-references between interfaces regardless of declaration order.

3. **Added comprehensive equivalence tests**: 12 test cases covering array/object destructuring
   from literals, function returns, const declarations, renamed properties, skipped elements,
   nested objects, and multiple sequential destructuring.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — Fixed struct type resolution in `compileObjectDestructuring`
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — Added `resolveStructFieldTypes` post-pass
- `tests/equivalence/basic-destructuring.test.ts` — New test file with 12 test cases

### What worked
- Using `resultType.typeIdx` directly for struct lookup eliminates the type mismatch
- Post-pass resolution handles interface ordering issues elegantly
- All 12 new tests pass, 0 regressions in existing 476 passing tests

### What didn't
- Default values in array destructuring when RHS is shorter than pattern still fails
  (separate issue: tuple struct creation with wrong number of fields)
