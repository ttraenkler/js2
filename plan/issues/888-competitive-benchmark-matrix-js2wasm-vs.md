# #888 -- Competitive benchmark matrix: js2wasm vs StarlingMonkey, Javy, and native Node.js

## Problem

We do not yet have a reproducible benchmark that answers the concrete deployment
question:

- how large is the compiled module
- how fast is the cold start
- how fast is steady-state execution

for the same JavaScript program under multiple execution models.

The first comparison that must exist is:

1. native JavaScript executed directly in Node.js
2. JavaScript compiled to WebAssembly with StarlingMonkey and executed in Wasmtime
3. JavaScript compiled to WebAssembly with js2wasm and executed in Wasmtime

The broader benchmark matrix should remain open to additional comparison points
where they are meaningful, especially:

4. JavaScript compiled with Javy and executed in Wasmtime
5. js2wasm output executed in other relevant hosts where startup/perf tradeoffs
   differ from Wasmtime

This comparison matters because js2wasm's value proposition is not only semantic
coverage, but also shipping smaller standalone WebAssembly modules with better
cold-start characteristics than interpreter-bundling approaches.

## Approach

Create a benchmark harness that compiles and runs the same JavaScript programs
through a competitive matrix of toolchains and runtimes, with the three-way
Node.js vs StarlingMonkey+Wasmtime vs js2wasm+Wasmtime comparison treated as the
minimum required slice.

### Metrics

1. **Module size**
   - raw `.wasm` size
   - compressed size where relevant
2. **Cold start time**
   - time to load, compile, instantiate, and reach first user code
3. **Runtime performance**
   - steady-state execution time for benchmark workloads
4. **Optional supporting metric**
   - peak RSS or process memory if it is straightforward to capture reproducibly

### Runtimes

| Path | Compilation | Execution | Purpose |
|------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Node.js baseline** | none | `node` | direct JS baseline |
| **StarlingMonkey + Wasmtime** | JS -> Wasm | `wasmtime` | interpreter-in-Wasm comparison |
| **js2wasm + Wasmtime** | JS -> Wasm | `wasmtime` | direct AOT Wasm comparison |
| **Javy + Wasmtime** | JS -> Wasm | `wasmtime` | additional bundled-runtime comparison |

The initial implementation may ship with only the first three rows if Javy adds
too much setup overhead. The issue is still intended to cover the broader matrix
once the baseline harness exists.

### Benchmark programs

Use a small benchmark suite that is implementable in all three paths and covers
different bottlenecks:

1. **Numeric compute**
   - `fibonacci` / tight arithmetic loop
2. **JSON workload**
   - parse + transform + stringify
3. **Array workload**
   - map/filter/reduce or sort on medium arrays
4. **String workload**
   - concatenation / slicing / substring-heavy path

Avoid benchmarks that are not yet comparably supported across both Wasm paths
until the harness is stable.

### Setup

```
benchmarks/
  programs/
    fib.js
    json.js
    array.js
    string.js
  compare-runtimes.ts
  results/
    runtime-compare-{timestamp}.json
```

## Implementation

1. Build a single benchmark runner that:
   - executes the raw JS benchmark under Node.js
   - compiles the same source through StarlingMonkey and runs it under Wasmtime
   - compiles the same source through js2wasm and runs it under Wasmtime
   - optionally compiles the same source through Javy and runs it under Wasmtime
2. Capture results in structured JSON for each benchmark/program:
   - source id
   - toolchain id
   - runtime id
   - module size
   - cold start time
   - runtime time
   - tool versions and command lines
3. Store benchmark inputs and results in-repo so runs are reproducible and
   comparable across commits.
4. Optionally render the results on the public report page or dashboard once the
   raw measurement pipeline is stable.

## Open decisions

- whether StarlingMonkey should be invoked via a pinned npm package, checked-in
  binary, or scripted external dependency
- whether Javy belongs in the first milestone or as a second-phase comparison
- whether cold start is measured as:
  - full CLI process launch plus module initialization
  - or just the runtime's load/instantiate segment
- whether Node.js baseline should report only runtime time, or an analogous
  startup metric as well

## Acceptance criteria

- At least 3 benchmark programs run successfully in the initial 3-path slice:
  - Node.js baseline
  - StarlingMonkey + Wasmtime
  - js2wasm + Wasmtime
- Results include:
  - module size
  - cold start time
  - runtime performance
- Output is written as structured JSON checked into `benchmarks/results/`
- Tool versions and benchmark commands are pinned or recorded
- A short comparison table or report can be generated from the recorded results
- The harness is designed so Javy or other comparison paths can be added without
  redesigning the result format
