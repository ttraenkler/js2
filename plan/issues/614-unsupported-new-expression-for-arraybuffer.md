# Issue #614: Unsupported new expression for ArrayBuffer/DataView

## Problem
203 tests fail with "Unsupported new expression for class: ArrayBuffer" and ~118 with DataView.
TypedArray constructors (Uint8Array, Int32Array, etc.) also hit the same error.

## Fix
Add constructor handling in `compileNewExpression` for:
1. ArrayBuffer - vec struct with i32 elements (byte buffer)
2. DataView - wraps an ArrayBuffer reference
3. TypedArray constructors (Uint8Array, Int8Array, Int16Array, etc.) - vec struct with f64 elements
