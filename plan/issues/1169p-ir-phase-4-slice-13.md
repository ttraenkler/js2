# #1169p — IR Phase 4 Slice 13: String + Array prototype methods through IR

## Problem

Method calls on string and array values fall back to legacy even when the
receiver and arguments are Phase-1 claimable. The selector currently accepts
`<recv>.<method>(args)` only when `recv` resolves to a **local class or extern
class** instance (slice 4 / #1169d + slice 10 / #1169i). Built-in string/array
methods are not modelled as extern classes, so `str.slice(1)`, `arr.push(x)`,
`arr.length` (on array — `.length` on string IS already handled) fail the
selector.

High-value methods (by test262 occurrence):
- **String**: `.length` (done), `.slice()`, `.indexOf()`, `.includes()`,
  `.charAt()`, `.charCodeAt()`, `.split()`, `.trim()`, `.toUpperCase()`,
  `.toLowerCase()`, `.startsWith()`, `.endsWith()`, `.padStart()`, `.replace()`
- **Array**: `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.length`, `.join()`, `.indexOf()`,
  `.includes()`, `.slice()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.forEach()`,
  `.find()`, `.findIndex()`, `.every()`, `.some()`

## What this unlocks

Prototype method dispatch on strings and arrays is the last major category of
expressions blocking IR claim on real-world JS. Combined with slices 11–12,
this slice should push `planIrCompilation`'s claim rate to 80%+.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `IrExternClassMeta` (or equivalent) entries registered for `String` and
   `Array` built-ins with their method signatures
2. `isPhase1Expr` accepts `.slice()`, `.indexOf()`, `.includes()`, `.push()`,
   `.pop()`, `.join()` and the other high-value methods listed above
3. IR lowering calls the appropriate host import or emits Wasm-native
   implementation for each method (reuse `src/codegen/` implementations where
   possible, forwarding to the IR runtime interface)
4. `nativeStrings` mode: string methods lower to WasmGC i16-array intrinsics
   where available; JS-host mode: lower to string host imports
5. Equivalence tests pass; test262 does not regress

## Implementation notes

- Model `String` and `Array` as pseudo extern-classes in the IR resolver.
  `getExternClassInfo("String")` and `getExternClassInfo("Array")` return
  method signatures. The selector already accepts `<extern-class>.<method>()`.
- For each method: either (a) emit a direct Wasm-native implementation or (b)
  call the existing host import that the legacy path uses. Option (b) is easier
  but doesn't work in standalone/WASI mode — prefer (a) for the high-value set.
- `arr.map(fn)` / `arr.filter(fn)` require callback handling — defer these if
  the closure argument interacts poorly with the IR's closure model.

## Depends on

#1169o for dynamic element access (needed for array method implementations)
