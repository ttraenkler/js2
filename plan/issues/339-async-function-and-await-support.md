# Issue #339: Async function and await support

3,317 tests were skipped because of the `async` flag in test262 metadata.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
1. **Removed the `async` flag skip filter** in `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- tests with `flags: [async]` are no longer automatically skipped
2. **Added Promise<T> unwrapping in resolveWasmType** in `src/codegen/index.ts` -- `Promise<T>` types are resolved to `T` at the Wasm level, since async functions are compiled synchronously
3. **Added $DONE shim** in `tests/test262-runner.ts` wrapTest function -- async test262 tests use `$DONE()` callback for completion signaling; our shim sets `__fail` if an error is passed
4. **Added equivalence tests** in `tests/equivalence/async-function.test.ts` -- 7 tests covering basic async function patterns (return values, parameters, await, arrow functions, conditionals)

### Key design decisions
- `async function` compiles as a regular function (no suspension/Promise creation)
- `await expr` compiles as identity (pass-through) -- already existed in `expressions.ts`
- `Promise<T>` type resolves to `T` in Wasm -- this is the key type-level change
- `async-iteration` and `top-level-await` remain in UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES (genuinely unsupported)

### What worked
- The existing `await` pass-through handling in expressions.ts was already correct
- `ts.isFunctionDeclaration` already matches async function declarations
- Promise<T> unwrapping in resolveWasmType fixed type mismatches for async functions
- The change also improved existing test results (fewer failures than baseline)

### What didn't work
- Most async-flagged test262 tests still fail because they use `.then()` chains which require Promise method support
- Tests using `$DONE` callback pattern need full Promise infrastructure to work properly

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- Promise<T> unwrapping in resolveWasmType
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- removed async skip filter, added $DONE shim
- `tests/equivalence/async-function.test.ts` -- new test file

### Tests now passing
- 7 new equivalence tests for async function patterns
- No regressions in existing tests (actually improved: 3 failed files vs 4 on baseline)
