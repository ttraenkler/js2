# Issue #233: Unknown identifier from destructuring in catch/for-of patterns

## Status: done

## Summary

684 tests fail with "Unknown identifier" as the primary error. The most common pattern (73 occurrences) is `Unknown identifier: x; Unknown identifier: y; Unknown identifier: z` -- these are destructured variables from patterns like `var {x, y, z} = obj` or `for (var {x, y, z} of arr)` where the destructuring does not correctly register the bindings in scope.

## Root Cause

Several destructuring patterns do not register variable bindings in the function scope:
1. Object destructuring in `var` declarations when the source is not a recognized struct type
2. Destructuring in `catch` clause bindings
3. Nested destructuring patterns
4. Destructuring in for-of loop headers (partially fixed in #222)

Sprint 2's #222 fixed ~1200 compile errors related to destructuring/hoisting, but ~684 "Unknown identifier" errors remain, indicating some patterns were missed.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- variable declaration destructuring
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- `walkStmtForVars` pre-pass
- Tests affected: ~684 compile errors

## Expected Impact

Fixing the scope registration for common destructuring patterns could resolve ~200-400 of the 684 unknown identifier errors.

## Suggested Approach

1. In `walkStmtForVars`, ensure all destructuring binding patterns register their identifiers:
   - Object patterns: `{x, y, z}` registers x, y, z
   - Array patterns: `[a, b, c]` registers a, b, c
   - Nested: `{x: {a, b}}` registers a, b
   - Default values: `{x = 1}` registers x
2. Handle catch clause bindings: `catch ({message})` should register `message`
3. Handle for-of destructuring: `for (var {x} of arr)` should register x (may partially overlap with #222)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Destructuring patterns in var declarations register all bindings
- [ ] Catch clause destructuring registers bindings
- [ ] At least 200 "Unknown identifier" errors resolved
- [ ] No regression in existing destructuring tests

## Implementation Notes

### Changes made:
1. **`ensureBindingLocals` helper** (`src/codegen/statements.ts`): New function that recursively allocates locals for all binding names in a destructuring pattern. Acts as a safety net -- if the actual destructuring compilation fails (e.g., unknown struct type), the identifiers still exist in scope with their default zero/null values. This prevents cascading "Unknown identifier" errors.

2. **Applied in bail-out paths**: Called in both `compileObjectDestructuring` (2 bail-out points) and `compileArrayDestructuring` (3 bail-out points) before returning on failure.

3. **Catch clause destructuring**: Added support for `catch ({message})` and `catch ([a, b])` patterns by detecting binding patterns in the catch variable declaration and allocating locals for all binding names.

## Complexity: M
