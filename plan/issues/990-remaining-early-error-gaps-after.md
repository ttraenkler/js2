# #990 -- Remaining early-error gaps after detectEarlyErrors()

## Implementation Summary

Extended `src/compiler/validation.ts` to detect more ES early errors: reserved words used as identifiers, module-level syntax violations, `using` declarations outside legal contexts, and ASI-sensitive patterns. Added tests in `tests/issue-990.test.ts`.

First attempt introduced 175 regressions via an over-broad `isStrictMode` module-detect; reverted that specific change (sha=4db08bf9) while keeping the valid early-error detection. Final result: +26 delta, 0 regressions.
