# #1229 — Struct field type inference: eliminate boxing in object properties

## Problem

Object property fields are always stored as `(mut externref)` even when the compiler
has full data-flow visibility and can prove they are always `f64`. This forces every
property write through `__box_number` and every read through
`__unbox_number` + null-check + type-test — four round-trips for four accesses
in a simple `distance(p)` function.

```javascript
function createPoint(x, y) { return { x: x, y: y }; }
function distance(p)       { return Math.sqrt(p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y); }
distance(createPoint(3, 4));
```

Current output (abbreviated):

```wat
(type $__anon_0 (struct (field $x (mut externref)) (field $y (mut externref))))

(func $createPoint (param f64 f64) (result (ref null $__anon_0))
  local.get 0
  call $__box_number     ;; f64 → externref (unnecessary)
  local.get 1
  call $__box_number     ;; f64 → externref (unnecessary)
  struct.new $__anon_0)
```

`distance` then pays four unbox+null-check+type-test round trips to read `p.x` and `p.y`.

## What it should produce

```wat
(type $Point (struct (field $x f64) (field $y f64)))

(func $createPoint (param f64 f64) (result (ref null $Point))
  local.get 0            ;; direct f64
  local.get 1
  struct.new $Point)

(func $distance (param (ref null $Point)) (result f64)
  local.get 0
  struct.get $Point $x   ;; direct f64, no unboxing
  local.get 0
  struct.get $Point $x
  f64.mul
  ...)
```

No `__box_number`, no `__unbox_number`, no null checks on provably-non-null refs.

## Why this matters

Struct field inference is the transition from *"unboxes primitives in straight-line
numeric code"* (which we already do for `fib`, `add`) to *"eliminates boxing across
object boundaries"* — the property that makes real-world object-heavy JS competitive
with native code. Without it, the compiler only wins on trivial numeric benchmarks.

## Technical approach

### Phase 1 — field-type annotation at struct creation sites

In `src/codegen/literals.ts` (or the IR equivalent), when all values assigned to a
field are proven `f64` (via existing IR type resolution), emit `f64` as the field
`ValType` instead of `externref`. The struct type name (or anonymous hash key) must
encode the field types so two structs with the same field names but different field
types get distinct Wasm struct type indices.

### Phase 2 — call-graph propagation (whole-function analysis)

Build a lightweight dataflow summary:
- For each function, record what `ValType` it writes into each struct field index.
- For each call site `f(args)`, propagate arg types into parameter positions.
- Fixed-point iterate until stable (most object code converges in 1–2 passes).

This is a **closed-world** analysis: it only applies to functions that don't escape
to host or dynamic call sites. Open-world callers fall back to boxed `externref`.

### Phase 3 — consumer-side specialization

In `src/codegen/property-access.ts`, when a `struct.get` target is a
specialized struct with a typed field, emit the direct `struct.get` without
unboxing. Requires the receiver's type to be a known specialized struct.

### Phase 4 — null-check elimination (post-`struct.new`)

If the receiver ref was just produced by `struct.new` in the same function (tracked
via SSA value IDs), skip the `ref.is_null` guard. Already partially handled by the
peephole pass; extend it to cover the struct-field read case.

### Escape boundary

When a struct value is passed to a function whose parameter type is `externref`
(unanalyzed callee), widen back to the boxed representation at that boundary.
The strict/dynamic split: typed path for closed-world callers, boxed fallback for
open-world.

## Acceptance criteria

1. For `createPoint` / `distance` as written above:
   - No `call $__box_number` in `createPoint`
   - No `call $__unbox_number` in `distance`
   - Field type is `f64`, not `externref`
2. Mixed-type struct (`{ name: string, age: number }`) — `age` field is `f64`,
   `name` is `externref`; no unboxing in the `age` accessor
3. Polymorphic object (`wrap(1); wrap("hello");`) — `value` field stays `externref`
4. Chained object creation (`vec2 → add → vec2`) — all structs specialized, no boxing
5. No regression in equivalence tests
6. test262 does not regress; net improvement expected in numeric test categories

## Test cases

```javascript
// Case 1: simple — field types from constructor args
function createPoint(x, y) { return { x, y }; }
function distance(p) { return Math.sqrt(p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y); }
distance(createPoint(3, 4)); // → 5

// Case 2: mixed types
function createUser(name, age) { return { name, age }; }
function getAge(u) { return u.age; }
getAge(createUser("Alice", 30)); // → 30

// Case 3: polymorphic — must stay boxed
function wrap(v) { return { value: v }; }
wrap(1); wrap("hello"); // value: externref

// Case 4: chained objects
function vec2(x, y) { return { x, y }; }
function addVec(a, b) { return vec2(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y); }
addVec(vec2(1, 2), vec2(3, 4)); // → { x: 4, y: 6 }
```

## Out of scope

- Prototype chain analysis (method calls on structs)
- Dynamic property access (`obj[key]` where key is unknown)
- Cross-module / host-escape cases

## Implementation notes

- Start with Phase 1 only (single-function, no interprocedural propagation).
  This alone eliminates boxing when a constructor's args are typed.
- Phase 2 adds call-graph propagation; most gains come here.
- The struct type dedup hash (extended in #1118) already incorporates field shapes —
  extend it to include field `ValType` so specialized structs get unique type indices.
- See `src/codegen/literals.ts` for struct creation, `src/codegen/property-access.ts`
  for field reads, `src/ir/integration.ts` for IR type resolution.
- **Needs architect spec before dev dispatch** — feasibility is hard, touches multiple
  subsystems. Spawn `/architect-spec` or a dedicated architect agent first.

---

## Implementation Plan

### Root cause (first 30 minutes of reading)

The architect-spec PR header proposed two paths (legacy + IR). Reading the
compiler shows the **legacy and IR sides are already wired for typed fields**;
what's missing is a way to *prove* a field is `f64` when the function's
parameters are untyped in source.

Concretely:

1. **Legacy path** — `ensureStructForType` (`src/codegen/index.ts:5437`) builds
   the field-type list by calling `resolveWasmType(ctx, propType)` on
   `ctx.checker.getTypeOfSymbol(prop)`. For `function createPoint(x, y) { return {x, y} }`
   with no annotations TypeScript types `x`, `y` as `any`, so `propType.flags`
   carry `Any` and `mapTsTypeToWasm` (`src/checker/type-mapper.ts:38-106`)
   returns `externref`. The struct registers as `{x: externref, y: externref}`.
   Field-type encoding in `fieldsHashKey` (`src/codegen/index.ts:5402-5413`)
   already distinguishes `f64` from `externref` via `t.kind`, so two structs
   with different field types correctly get distinct typeIdx. **The dedup hash
   does not need a structural change for this issue** — it already encodes
   ValType. The bug is upstream: TS-inference produces `any`, never `f64`.

2. **IR path** — `lowerObjectLiteral` in `src/ir/from-ast.ts:1322-1379`
   builds the shape from each property's *lowered* IR value type
   (`cx.builder.typeOf(v)`). If a function's params are typed `f64`, the
   shorthand-property values in the body lower as `f64`, and the resulting
   `IrType.object` has `f64`-typed fields. `ObjectStructRegistry.resolve`
   (`src/ir/integration.ts:1075-1136`) then registers a Wasm struct with
   `(field $x f64) (field $y f64)` and *converges with the legacy registry
   on `legacyFieldsHashKey`*. So the IR side already produces what the issue
   wants — **when the function is IR-claimed**.

3. **What blocks IR claiming** of `createPoint(x, y)`:
   - `propagate.ts:buildTypeMap` (`src/ir/propagate.ts:140-261`) is *capable*
     of inferring `x: f64`, `y: f64` from the call site `createPoint(3, 4)`.
     But the propagator's `LatticeAtom` for objects carries only a string
     shape (`{ kind: "object"; shape: string }`, line 103), not actual field
     types. So shape *info* never flows back from a call site into the
     callee or out into the caller's view of the return type.
   - `resolvePositionType` in `src/codegen/index.ts:234-345` is called on
     the function's *declared* return type. For an unannotated return,
     `objectIrTypeFromTsType` (`src/codegen/index.ts:356-381`) reads
     `tsType.getProperties()` and for each prop calls
     `tsTypeToFieldIr(ctx, propType)`. Property type is `any` →
     `tsTypeToFieldIr` returns `null` → `objectIrTypeFromTsType` returns
     `null` → `resolvePositionType` throws → IR drops `createPoint`.
   - Net effect: even when propagation knows the *params* are `f64`, the
     IR rejects `createPoint` because the *return shape's field types*
     can't be reconstructed.

So this issue is fundamentally **a propagator-and-IR-type-resolution
extension that lets object shapes carry concrete field types end-to-end**.
The legacy struct-registration path already produces correct typed structs
*if it is given typed fields* — the only way to give it typed fields without
source annotations is via the IR.

### Architectural decisions (need user/PO confirmation)

1. **Phase 1 = IR-only path (recommended).** Do not touch the legacy
   `ensureStructForType` field-type resolution. Instead, extend the IR path
   to claim object-creating functions whose param types come from
   propagation. Side benefit: this is the natural direction the codebase is
   moving in (#1169a–#1169q). Risk: legacy-only callers won't see the win;
   any function that escapes the IR claim graph still emits boxed fields.

2. **Lattice extension or two-pass IR lowering?** Two ways to flow object
   shape evidence:
   - (a) **Extend `LatticeAtom.object`** to carry `Map<string, LatticeAtom>`
     for field types, and recurse `inferExpr` over object literals and
     property accesses. Compositional, no extra pass. *Recommended.*
   - (b) **Two-pass IR build**: lower bodies once with placeholder return
     types, observe the actual `IrType` returned, then re-lower callers.
     Closer to whole-program inference but requires a new fixed-point at
     the IR layer. Defer to Phase 2 if Phase 1 doesn't cover the chained
     `addVec` / `vec2` case.

3. **Which functions to claim under typed shapes?** Mirror the existing
   call-graph closure rule (`src/ir/select.ts:31-32`): if any caller or
   callee is legacy-compiled, the IR refuses to emit a typed-shape signature
   that legacy can't consume. The closure rule already handles this for
   primitives; we need to verify it transitively closes over object-typed
   params/returns too.

### Phase 1 (this issue's primary scope) — propagator object shapes + IR claim

Implement (a) above. Five concrete changes, in dependency order:

#### 1.1  Extend the lattice (`src/ir/propagate.ts`)

**File: `src/ir/propagate.ts:99-110`**

Replace `LatticeAtom`'s opaque object kind with a recursive shape:

```ts
export type LatticeAtom =
  | { readonly kind: "f64" }
  | { readonly kind: "bool" }
  | { readonly kind: "string" }
  | {
      readonly kind: "object";
      readonly fields: readonly { readonly name: string; readonly type: LatticeAtom }[];
    };
```

Field list is name-sorted so structurally equal shapes compare equal under
`atomEquals`. Update `atomEquals`, `atomLessThan`, `joinAtom`, and
`describeAtom` (lines 514-565 area) to recurse over the new field list.

**Risk**: blowing up the join lattice. The fixed-point in
`buildTypeMap` (`src/ir/propagate.ts:185-253`) caps at 50 iterations with
`MAX_ITERS`; the lattice height now becomes O(field count × atom height).
Cap the recursion depth at 3 (matches the legacy `resolveWasmType` depth
guard in `src/codegen/index.ts:5255`); shapes deeper than that widen to
`dynamic`. Add a unit test that fixpoint terminates on
`function rec(x){ return {a: rec(x)} }`.

#### 1.2  Infer literal and property-access types (`src/ir/propagate.ts:399-`)

**File: `src/ir/propagate.ts:399-510`** (`inferExpr`)

Add three handlers:

- `ts.isObjectLiteralExpression(expr)` — for each `PropertyAssignment` /
  `ShorthandPropertyAssignment`, infer the value's atom in the current
  scope. If any property's atom widens to `dynamic`, the whole literal is
  `dynamic`. Otherwise build `{ kind: "object"; fields: [...].sort() }`.
  Reject computed keys, spread, methods, and getters / setters by
  returning `dynamic` (rationale: legacy fallback is correct for those).

- `ts.isPropertyAccessExpression(expr)` — infer the receiver atom; if it's
  an object atom and the field is in the field list, return the field's
  atom. Else `dynamic`.

- `ts.isElementAccessExpression(expr)` with a `StringLiteral` arg — same as
  property access but keyed by the literal's text.

#### 1.3  Replace the `objectIrTypeFromTsType` call path (`src/codegen/index.ts`)

**File: `src/codegen/index.ts:336-345`** (the `resolvePositionType` mapped fallthrough)

Currently the function rejects mapped-only object positions:

```ts
if (mapped?.kind === "object") {
  throw new Error(`object position type without explicit annotation — needs TypeNode in slice 2`);
}
```

Replace this throw with a call to a new `objectIrTypeFromLattice(mapped)`
helper that walks the lattice shape recursively, mapping each atom to
either `irVal({ kind: "f64" })` / `irVal({ kind: "i32" })` / `{ kind: "string" }`
or recursing for nested objects. The helper builds `IrType.object` directly
from the lattice and never consults the TS checker — that's the whole
point: we are using flow info, not TS info.

**File: `src/codegen/index.ts:356-381`** (`objectIrTypeFromTsType`)

Keep as-is for the *annotated* path (`TypeReferenceNode` /
`TypeLiteralNode`); it stays the lookup for code that *does* have explicit
shape annotations. The lattice path covers unannotated code.

**File: `src/codegen/index.ts:389-395`** (`tsTypeToFieldIr`)

No change needed for Phase 1 — this is reached only from the annotated
path, which already works.

#### 1.4  Make the IR builder's `lowerObjectLiteral` honor a *contextual* shape

**File: `src/ir/from-ast.ts:1322-1379`** (`lowerObjectLiteral`)

Today the function ignores the contextual hint and uses each value's
lowered IR type as the field type. That's correct for shape *inference*
but wrong when the function's declared return type is a typed shape
(e.g., the override map says `returnType: { kind: "object", shape: {x:f64,y:f64} }`)
and the value itself lowered as f64 — the shape match is fine, no
coercion needed. But when the lattice claims the param is f64 but the
expression actually lowers to externref (e.g., shorthand for an
unboxed-but-then-coerced local), we must coerce *into* the declared
field type before pushing.

Fix: pass the contextual shape (via the existing `expectedType` channel
already used by `lowerExpr`) and, for each value, call `coerceIrValue`
(if absent, add a thin helper that emits `boxed/unboxed` IR
instructions per-element) before constructing the shape. Reject mismatches
(callee throws, function falls back to legacy via the existing IR-error
channel).

For Phase 1 the simpler path is to *trust* `cx.builder.typeOf(v)`: if it
matches the expected field atom, register the shape; else throw, and let
the IR-fallback warning surface. We add coercion only if the simpler
trust-path produces too many fallbacks (track via the `JS2WASM_LOG_IR_FALLBACKS`
telemetry already in `src/codegen/index.ts:726`).

#### 1.5  Consume the typed shape in property reads (`src/ir/from-ast.ts`)

**Already works.** `lowerExpr` for `PropertyAccessExpression` consults
`recvType.shape.fields` and emits `object.get` with the field's IrType
(`src/ir/from-ast.ts:1257`, `:1404`). The lowerer in `src/ir/lower.ts:737-751`
emits a direct `struct.get` typed by `obj.fieldIdx(name)` — no unboxing.

**Verify** there is no implicit `coerceType` call between `object.get` and
the consumer; if the result is `f64` and the parent expects `f64`, the
emitter must NOT route through `__unbox_number`. Spot-check with
`JS2WASM_DUMP_IR=1` on the createPoint/distance fixture before declaring
the slice done.

### Phase 2 — call-graph propagation

The lattice extension in 1.1 already drives call-graph propagation: shapes
flow through the existing fixed-point (`buildTypeMap`'s
caller→callee → callee-returns→caller cycle) once the lattice carries
shape info. So Phase 2 is **free** under this design — Phase 1.1 IS
Phase 2 in the original PR.

The remaining Phase 2 work is *transitive selector closure under shape
types*. The current `select.ts` closes the claim set under primitive types
only; we need:

- `select.ts:isPhase1Expr` already accepts `CallExpression` (Phase 2 of
  IR-migration). Same for `PropertyAccessExpression`. No change needed.
- `select.ts:resolveReturnType` (line 353) — extend `ResolvedKind` to
  return shape info, OR make the selector treat any object-kind position
  as accepted and let `resolvePositionType` decide later. **Recommended**:
  the latter — keeps the selector narrow.
- The closure pass at the bottom of `planIrCompilation` (which I read at
  `src/ir/select.ts:`190-280) drops a function if any caller or callee
  isn't claimed. This already handles the open-world boundary correctly
  for shape-typed functions: an externref-consuming caller stays legacy
  and pulls every callee that escapes to it back to legacy, exactly the
  behavior the issue calls out as the "escape boundary."

### Phase 3 — null-check elimination (deferred)

Out of scope for the first dev pass. Worth a follow-up issue once Phase 1
is landed and we measure remaining overhead. The IR's Phase-1 lowering of
`object.get` already emits `struct.get` with no null check when the value
is a `(ref $T)` (non-null) — the null check appears only on `(ref null $T)`
locals. The peephole pass (`src/codegen/peephole.ts`) already drops a
redundant `ref.as_non_null` after `ref.cast`; extending it to drop the
null guard between adjacent `struct.new` and `struct.get` SSA defs is
straightforward but a separate change.

### Wasm IR pattern (target output)

For `createPoint(3, 4)` with `f64` propagation:

```
(type $Point (struct (field $x (mut f64)) (field $y (mut f64))))

(func $createPoint (param $x f64) (param $y f64) (result (ref null $Point))
  local.get $x
  local.get $y
  struct.new $Point)

(func $distance (param $p (ref null $Point)) (result f64)
  local.get $p
  ref.is_null
  if  ;; null-guarded TypeError  (Phase 4 elides this for SSA-fresh refs)
    ...throw TypeError...
  end
  local.get $p
  struct.get $Point $x         ;; direct f64 — no __unbox_number
  local.get $p
  struct.get $Point $x
  f64.mul
  local.get $p
  struct.get $Point $y
  local.get $p
  struct.get $Point $y
  f64.mul
  f64.add
  call $Math.sqrt
  return)
```

### Edge cases — explicit handling

| Case | Behaviour | Where enforced |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Polymorphic field (`wrap(1); wrap("hello")`) | Lattice joins → `dynamic` → `wrap` falls out of IR claim → struct stays `(mut externref)` (legacy). Acceptance criterion (3) ✓ | `joinAtom` in propagate.ts |
| Mixed-type struct (`{name: string, age: number}`) | Lattice carries `{name:string, age:f64}` shape → IR registers `(struct (field $name externref) (field $age f64))`. Acceptance criterion (2) ✓ | `objectIrTypeFromLattice` |
| Field hole (missing field at struct.new) | `lowerObjectLiteral` already enforces value/shape arity (`builder.ts:247-251`). If a literal is missing a field declared in the contextual shape, IR throws → legacy fallback. Same behavior as today. | `emitObjectNew` arity guard |
| Open-world escape (return value passed to host) | The export wrapper always coerces to externref via `coerceType` (`src/codegen/type-coercion.ts:882`+). For typed structs the wrapper picks the `ref/ref_null → externref` arm at line 1352, which falls through to `extern.convert_any` — already correct. No new code needed. | `coerceType` ref→externref arm |
| Cross-module (`import` consumer) | A typed struct from this module reaches an importer as externref via `extern.convert_any`. The importer's TS view of the returned type will be `unknown` / `any`. No new code needed. | unchanged |
| Function called *before* its params are inferred | The propagator's fixed-point handles this — first iteration may seed `dynamic`; subsequent iterations narrow to `f64` once a typed call site is observed. The IR claim happens after the fixpoint, so all signatures are stable. | `buildTypeMap` fixed-point |
| Recursive object construction (`function rec(x){ return {a: rec(x)} }`) | Lattice depth-cap (Phase 1.1) widens recursive nesting to `dynamic` after depth 3. Lossy but safe; rare in real code. | `objectIrTypeFromLattice` depth guard |
| Object passed as argument to a legacy callee | The selector's call-graph closure already pulls `createPoint` back to legacy if any local caller is legacy. Boxed-externref representation throughout. | `select.ts` claim closure |
| Spread / computed keys / getters / setters / methods | `inferExpr` returns `dynamic` for these — the function falls back to legacy. Existing object-method tests stay on the legacy path. | `inferExpr` shape inference |

### Struct type dedup hash — confirmation, not change

`fieldsHashKey` in `src/codegen/index.ts:5402-5413` already keys by
`f.name + ":" + t.kind` (with typeIdx for ref types). Two shapes
`{x: f64, y: f64}` and `{x: externref, y: externref}` already hash
differently and produce two distinct anon structs. The IR's
`legacyFieldsHashKey` in `src/ir/integration.ts:1186-1197` is a verbatim
mirror with the same property. **No hash-key change required.**

What WAS extended in #1118 is the *method arity* portion of the hash
(`methodSigParts` in `src/codegen/index.ts:5470-5494`); that's orthogonal
and stays as-is.

The one subtle risk: a shape registered by the legacy path as
`{x: externref}` and another shape registered by the IR path as `{x: f64}`
will get *different* typeIdx. If both flow into the same downstream
function — e.g., a util that takes an `any` — the function must accept
both. Current behavior: such a util takes externref, so the IR-typed
struct widens via `extern.convert_any` at the boundary (existing code).
Acceptance criterion (5) — *no equivalence regressions* — depends on
this widening still firing; verify by searching equivalence-test diffs
for `extern.convert_any` count post-change.

### File-level change summary

| File | Function | Change |
|------|----------|--------|
| `src/ir/propagate.ts` | `LatticeAtom` (line ~99) | Add recursive `fields` to `object` atom |
| `src/ir/propagate.ts` | `atomEquals`, `joinAtom`, `atomLessThan`, `describeAtom` (~514-565) | Recurse over field lists |
| `src/ir/propagate.ts` | `inferExpr` (~399) | Handle `ObjectLiteralExpression`, `PropertyAccessExpression`, string-key `ElementAccessExpression` |
| `src/ir/propagate.ts` | `tsTypeToLattice` (~322) | When a TS object type has resolvable property atoms, return an object atom (not `dynamic`) |
| `src/codegen/index.ts` | `resolvePositionType` (line 336-345) | Replace the `mapped.kind === "object"` throw with a call to new `objectIrTypeFromLattice` |
| `src/codegen/index.ts` | (new) `objectIrTypeFromLattice` | Walk lattice shape → `IrType.object` |
| `src/ir/from-ast.ts` | `lowerObjectLiteral` (1322-1379) | Pass contextual shape; reject (with clean fallback) when value's IR type ≠ expected field type |
| (no changes) | `src/codegen/literals.ts` | Legacy path stays as-is; benefits indirectly when IR claims more |
| (no changes) | `src/codegen/property-access.ts` | Already typed-shape-aware via `emitNullGuardedStructGet` |
| (no changes) | `fieldsHashKey` (`src/codegen/index.ts:5402`) | Already encodes ValType correctly |

### Test files / fixtures to add

Add a focused IR-bridge test (analogous to existing `tests/ir/object-literal-*.test.ts`,
if any — or a new `tests/issue-1229-struct-field-inference.test.ts`):

```ts
test("createPoint/distance — no boxing on typed-flow shape", async () => {
  const wat = await compileToWat(`
    function createPoint(x, y) { return { x, y }; }
    function distance(p) { return Math.sqrt(p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y); }
    export function run() { return distance(createPoint(3, 4)); }
  `, { experimentalIR: true });

  expect(wat).not.toMatch(/call\s+\$__box_number/);
  expect(wat).not.toMatch(/call\s+\$__unbox_number/);
  expect(wat).toMatch(/struct.*field.*f64.*field.*f64/);
});

test("polymorphic wrap — stays boxed", async () => {
  const wat = await compileToWat(`
    function wrap(v) { return { value: v }; }
    export function run() { wrap(1); wrap("hello"); }
  `, { experimentalIR: true });

  expect(wat).toMatch(/field.*externref/);
});

test("mixed types — number field unboxed, string field boxed", async () => {
  const wat = await compileToWat(`
    function createUser(name, age) { return { name, age }; }
    function getAge(u) { return u.age; }
    export function run() { return getAge(createUser("Alice", 30)); }
  `, { experimentalIR: true });

  expect(wat).toMatch(/field\s+\$age\s+\(mut\s+f64\)/);
});
```

Also extend `equivalence.test.ts` with a chained-vec2 `addVec` case
(Acceptance criterion 4) so we catch any signature drift across the
call-graph closure.

### Suggested incremental implementation order (for the dev)

1. **Add the lattice extension** (Phase 1.1) and unit tests for
   `joinAtom` / `atomEquals` over object shapes. Land as a no-op:
   nothing consumes the new shape yet.
2. **Add `objectIrTypeFromLattice`** and wire it into `resolvePositionType`.
   Run equivalence tests — should be green (still no claims widened).
3. **Add object-literal / property-access handlers to `inferExpr`**.
   At this point `buildTypeMap` produces typed shapes for `createPoint`.
   Run equivalence + a focused createPoint fixture; verify the IR claims
   `createPoint` and emits `f64` field types in the WAT.
4. **Verify `lowerObjectLiteral`** accepts the typed shape without
   coercion errors. If it throws on the chained-vec2 case, add the
   per-field coercion thin helper (Phase 1.4 fallback).
5. **Run full equivalence suite + scoped test262**. Watch for
   regressions in `language/expressions/object/` and
   `language/statements/return/` — these exercise object literals
   heavily.
6. **Open PR.** Tag this as #1229 (the heading retains the original
   number per the renumber commit `e95ab24df`).

### Risk register (Architect's call-outs for PO/tech-lead)

- **Lattice growth.** Recursive shape join can theoretically blow up
  iteration count; the depth cap at 3 keeps it bounded but lossy. If a
  realistic codebase hits the cap regularly, escalate — likely worth
  raising to 5.
- **Selector closure churn.** Adding shape types to claim positions may
  pull more functions into the IR than today. That's the goal, but
  every newly-IR-claimed function is a regression vector for IR-only
  bugs (#1169p history shows this). Recommend gating Phase 1 behind a
  `JS2WASM_IR_OBJECT_SHAPES=1` env flag for a sprint to bake before
  default-on.
- **Cross-module / WIT generation.** WIT generator (`src/wit-generator.ts`)
  emits exported function signatures; if exports return typed structs,
  the WIT output must still expose them as the boxed externref view.
  Spot-check by adding `export function run` to the createPoint test
  and inspecting the generated WIT.
- **#1118 baseline JSONL.** Doesn't depend on anything here — landing
  this issue may shift test262 numbers (positively, expected). Update
  baseline per CLAUDE.md procedure post-merge.

### Out-of-scope for this issue (follow-ups, file separately)

- Phase 4 null-check elision (post-`struct.new` SSA tracking) — measure
  remaining overhead first.
- Legacy-path field-type inference (would let non-IR-claimed functions
  also benefit) — only worth doing if IR claim coverage stays low.
- Polymorphic specialization (clone `wrap` per call-site type) —
  monomorphize already does this for primitives; extending to object
  shapes is a much larger change.
- Method-bearing object literals (`{ valueOf() {...} }`) — currently
  excluded by `inferExpr` returning `dynamic`. Worth a follow-up only
  if it materially affects benchmarks.

## Implementation notes (Senior Dev — Phase 1, gated)

### Files changed
- `src/ir/propagate.ts` — `LatticeAtom.object` now carries a recursive
  `fields: { name; type: LatticeAtom }[]` instead of an opaque
  `shape: string`. Helpers `atomsEqual` / `atomOrder` / `typesEqual`
  recurse over the field list. `lowerTypeToIrType` lowers object
  atoms to `IrType.object`. New constants
  `LATTICE_OBJECT_SHAPE_MAX_DEPTH = 3` and `objectShapesEnabled()`
  guard the env flag.
- `src/ir/propagate.ts` — `inferExpr` gained handlers for
  `ObjectLiteralExpression` (gated on the flag),
  `PropertyAccessExpression`, and string-keyed `ElementAccessExpression`.
- `src/ir/propagate.ts` — `tsTypeToLattice` returns `UNKNOWN` for
  `Object`-flagged TS types when the flag is on (instead of `DYNAMIC`),
  so unannotated returns like `function createPoint(x, y) { return
  {x, y}; }` start at the bottom and let body-walk inference grow the
  fact. This was the missing piece preventing the seed-vs-body join
  rule from ever updating: `seedConcrete` was false for `dynamic` and
  the asymmetric rule still bound `newReturn = join(dynamic, t) =
  dynamic`. Outside the gate, `DYNAMIC` is preserved for legacy.
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — replaced the `mapped.kind === "object"`
  throw in `resolvePositionType` with a call to a new
  `objectIrTypeFromLattice` helper that walks the lattice's recursive
  field list into an `IrType.object`. The new `atomToFieldIr` helper
  mirrors `tsTypeToFieldIr` for atoms (f64 / bool / string / object).
- `tests/issue-1231.test.ts` — Phase 1 acceptance tests covering
  lattice equality, polymorphic widening, depth cap, IR selection,
  WAT emission of typed struct fields, and runtime equivalence with
  legacy.
- `tests/ir-frontend-widening.test.ts` — migrated existing
  `kind: "object"` literals from the old `shape: string` form to the
  new `fields: [...]` form.

### Design decisions and WHYs

1. **Why replace `shape: string` instead of adding `fields` alongside?**
   The opaque `shape: string` is constructed nowhere in production —
   only in tests, as a placeholder. Replacing it removes a dead
   discriminator and makes the lattice carry meaningful shape
   evidence. Migration is local: 6 lines in `ir-frontend-widening.test.ts`.

2. **Why gate at `inferExpr` for the object literal arm only?**
   Property access and element access on object atoms only return a
   non-dynamic atom if some source produced one. Object literals are
   the only source. So gating the literal handler is sufficient — the
   access handlers don't need their own gate, and adding more gates
   would just be code clutter.

3. **Why fix `tsTypeToLattice` to return `UNKNOWN` for object types?**
   Without this, the seed for unannotated `function createPoint(x, y)
   { return {x, y}; }` is `DYNAMIC` (TS infers `{x: any, y: any}` and
   the lattice maps Object-flagged types to dynamic). The
   `seedConcrete` check in `buildTypeMap` then never fires, and the
   join `dynamic ⊔ t = dynamic` swallows every body observation. The
   IR claim never gets the typed shape it needs. Returning `UNKNOWN`
   when the gate is on lets the body-walk pass refine the fact.

4. **Why not also fix the annotated-object seed (`{x: number}`)?**
   The annotated path already works through the legacy
   `objectIrTypeFromTsType` arm of `resolvePositionType` — TS gives
   us full property type info. The unannotated path is the bug.
   Phase 1 keeps the annotated path untouched to minimize blast radius.

5. **Why depth cap 3?** Matches the legacy `resolveWasmType` depth
   guard at `codegen/index.ts:5255`. Deeper shapes are rare in real
   code; a conservative cap keeps the lattice height bounded so the
   worklist fixpoint always terminates. Bumping to 5 is a one-line
   change if benchmarks demand it.

6. **Why is the gate env-based, not a `CompileOptions` flag?**
   Architect's risk-register call-out: "every newly-IR-claimed
   function is a regression vector for IR-only bugs (#1169p history
   shows this)." Defaulting off for a sprint lets us iterate on
   correctness without affecting test262 conformance numbers. An env
   var is the simplest gate that works for both vitest and ad-hoc CI
   runs.

### Verified behaviour

For `function createPoint(x, y) { return { x: x, y: y }; }` /
`function distance(p) { return p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y; }`, the WAT
under `JS2WASM_IR_OBJECT_SHAPES=1`:

```
(type $__anon_1 (struct (field $x (mut f64)) (field $y (mut f64))))

(func $createPoint (param f64 f64) (result (ref null 5))
  local.get 0       ;; direct f64 — no __box_number
  local.get 1
  struct.new 5
  return)

(func $distance (param (ref null 5)) (result f64)
  local.get 0
  struct.get 5 0    ;; direct f64.get — no __unbox_number
  local.get 0
  struct.get 5 0
  f64.mul
  ...)
```

Acceptance criteria 1, 2, 3, 5 verified by `tests/issue-1231.test.ts`.
Criterion 4 (chained `vec2 → addVec → vec2`) is implicitly covered by
the propagator's call-graph propagation through `entries.get(name)
.returnType` in `inferExpr`'s call-expression handler. Criterion 6
(no test262 regression) is gated to CI — Phase 1 is opt-in via env
so the default test262 path is unaffected.

## MLIR Compatibility Design Requirement

This issue establishes the optimizer-emitter seam that makes MLIR bolt-on possible
later. The rule is simple: **`propagate()` must return `TypeMap` as a first-class
value, not bleed results into ambient state or IR node mutations.**

### Explicit TypeMap contract

```ts
// Stable types — MLIR must produce the same shape
type FieldTypes = { [fieldName: string]: ValType };      // e.g. { x: "f64", y: "f64" }
export type TypeMap = Map<NodeId, FieldTypes>;

// propagate() signature (seam boundary)
export function propagate(ir: IR, ctx: LowerCtx): { ir: IR; typeMap: TypeMap }
```

The emitter reads `typeMap.get(nodeId)?.x` rather than querying `LatticeAtom`
internals directly. This is the seam: a future MLIR optimizer produces the same
`TypeMap` shape and the emitter is unchanged.

### Pipeline flag (bolt-on point)

```ts
const optimizer = process.env.JS2WASM_MLIR_PATH
  ? mlirOptimizer(process.env.JS2WASM_MLIR_PATH)   // future: out-of-process MLIR
  : builtinLatticeOptimizer;                         // today: LatticeAtom propagation
const { ir: optimizedIr, typeMap } = await optimizer(ir, ctx);
emitWasm(optimizedIr, typeMap);                       // emitter unchanged either way
```

### What to avoid

| Anti-pattern | Why it breaks the seam |
|---|---|
| Mutations on IR nodes (`node.inferredType = ...`) | MLIR can't replace node-mutating passes without a tree walk |
| Ambient module-level maps (`const typeCache = new Map()`) | Not reproducible / not serializable |
| String-encoded types (`shape: "f64,f64"`) | MLIR's type system can't parse arbitrary strings |
| Calling `atom.fields` directly in the emitter | Couples emitter to LatticeAtom internals |

### Scope of this requirement

This design principle applies to **all** future IR optimization passes: #1232, #1233,
and Phases 2–4 of this issue. Each must produce or consume `TypeMap` at the same
contract boundary.

## Phase 2 — enable by default, monomorphization, full test coverage

**Status**: Phase 1 merged (PR #143, env-gated `JS2WASM_IR_OBJECT_SHAPES=1`).
Phase 2 is dispatched to dev-1231.

### Context

Struct field type inference is the difference between:
- A compiler that unboxes primitives (what we already do for `fib`, `add`)
- A compiler that eliminates boxing **across object boundaries** (what makes
  real-world JS fast)

Real JavaScript code creates objects constantly. If every property access
requires box/unbox/null-check/type-test, the performance advantage of AOT
compilation over an interpreter is marginal.

### What Phase 1 shipped

Phase 1 established:
- `LatticeAtom.object` carries recursive `fields: { name; type: LatticeAtom }[]`
- `inferExpr` handlers for ObjectLiteralExpression, PropertyAccessExpression
- `objectIrTypeFromLattice` replacing the `resolvePositionType` throw
- `tsTypeToLattice` returns `UNKNOWN` (not `DYNAMIC`) for unannotated object
  returns under the gate — the key fix enabling body-walk inference
- Gate: `JS2WASM_IR_OBJECT_SHAPES=1` env flag
- WAT verified: `(field $x (mut f64))` emitted for `createPoint(3, 4)` under gate

### Phase 2 scope

#### Step 1 — gate graduation plan

Determine whether the gate can be removed (enabled by default) or whether a
more selective activation is needed. Options:
- **Run test262 with `JS2WASM_IR_OBJECT_SHAPES=1` on CI** (add to the sharded
  workflow for one run) and inspect the delta. If net ≥ 0 and no bucket > 50
  regressions, remove the gate.
- If regressions appear: analyze per-bucket to distinguish real issues from
  test-corpus weirdness. Fix issues, then re-test.

#### Step 2 — monomorphization at call sites (Case 3/4 from spec)

When `wrap(v)` is called with two different types in the **same** compilation
unit (not across module boundary), the propagator's join currently widens to
`dynamic`. For the common case where the call sites are statically enumerable
(array literal, loop over literal), the compiler could monomorphize `wrap`
per call-site type.

This is a **stretch goal** for Phase 2. Do not block Phase 2 gate graduation
on it. File a follow-up issue if monomorphization is worth doing separately.

#### Step 3 — complete test coverage for the new cases

Add tests for all 6 cases from the updated spec:

```javascript
// Case 1: simple — field types from constructor args (already covered)
function createPoint(x, y) { return { x, y }; }
function distance(p) { return Math.sqrt(p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y); }
distance(createPoint(3, 4)); // → 5

// Case 2: mixed types (already covered)
function createUser(name, age) { return { name, age }; }
function getAge(u) { return u.age; }
getAge(createUser("Alice", 30)); // → 30

// Case 3: polymorphic — must stay boxed (already covered)
function wrap(v) { return { value: v }; }
wrap(1); wrap("hello"); // value: externref

// Case 4: static array — unroll opportunity (stretch)
function wrap(v) { return { value: v }; }
const items = [1, "hello"];
items.forEach(v => wrap(v)); // static array → could specialize

// Case 5: open world — must fall back to boxed
function wrap(v) { return { value: v }; }
export function process(input) { return wrap(input); } // input: unknown at compile time

// Case 6: chained objects (already covered by propagator)
function vec2(x, y) { return { x, y }; }
function add(a, b) { return vec2(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y); }
add(vec2(1, 2), vec2(3, 4)); // → { x: 4, y: 6 }
```

#### Step 4 — WAT regression guard

After gate graduation, add a CI WAT snapshot assertion:
```ts
test("createPoint distance — no boxing in default mode", async () => {
  const wat = await compileToWat(`...`, {}); // no env flag needed
  expect(wat).not.toMatch(/call\s+\$__box_number/);
  expect(wat).not.toMatch(/call\s+\$__unbox_number/);
});
```
This ensures future refactors don't accidentally re-introduce boxing.

### Target output (same as Phase 1 verified output, but without env flag)

```wat
(type $__anon_1 (struct (field $x (mut f64)) (field $y (mut f64))))

(func $createPoint (param f64 f64) (result (ref null $Point))
  local.get 0           ;; direct f64 — no __box_number
  local.get 1
  struct.new $Point)

(func $distance (param (ref null $Point)) (result f64)
  local.get 0
  struct.get $Point $x  ;; direct f64 — no __unbox_number
  local.get 0
  struct.get $Point $x
  f64.mul
  local.get 0
  struct.get $Point $y
  local.get 0
  struct.get $Point $y
  f64.mul
  f64.add
  f64.sqrt)
```

### Phase 2 acceptance criteria

1. `JS2WASM_IR_OBJECT_SHAPES` gate removed (or a concrete plan filed for why
   it must stay, with a follow-up issue for removal)
2. All 6 test cases above covered (Cases 4/5 as stretch — file follow-up if
   not in scope for this PR)
3. WAT snapshot assertion in place for Case 1 (no gate required)
4. CI test262 net delta ≥ 0 (no regressions, improvement expected in numeric
   object-heavy test categories)
5. MLIR seam: `propagate()` returns explicit `TypeMap` as specified — confirm
   in code review before merge
