# #336 -- For-of assignment destructuring on non-struct refs

## Status: in-review
11 test262 tests fail with "for-of assignment destructuring: element is not a struct ref". Object destructuring in for-of loops fails when the iterated value is a primitive (boolean, number, string) or when the destructuring pattern expects named properties.

## Error pattern
- for-of assignment destructuring: element is not a struct ref

## Likely causes
- For-of destructuring assumes iterated values are struct references
- Primitives (bool, number, string) need to be boxed or handled specially for destructuring
- Rest patterns in for-of destructuring not implemented

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Reduce test262 failures matching this error pattern

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
The core issue was that `compileForOfAssignDestructuring` in `src/codegen/statements.ts` did not handle nested destructuring patterns inside array assignment destructuring. When a for-of loop used `for ([{ x }] of [[{ x: 2 }]])`, the ObjectLiteralExpression `{ x }` inside the array literal was silently skipped because the code only handled `ts.isIdentifier(el)` elements.

The fix adds handling for nested `ObjectLiteralExpression` and `ArrayLiteralExpression` elements in both the tuple and vec paths of the array assignment destructuring branch. When a nested pattern is encountered, the element is extracted into a temporary local and `compileForOfAssignDestructuring` is called recursively.

Investigation also found that the originally-listed test262 tests (obj-empty-bool, obj-empty-num, etc.) already passed -- the empty object destructuring and primitive handling code was already in place. The actual common failure pattern was nested destructuring in array assignment form, which affected ~66 test262 tests.

### What worked
- Recursive approach mirrors the existing nested destructuring support in `compileForOfDestructuring` (binding pattern path)

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- Added nested pattern handling in `compileForOfAssignDestructuring`
- `tests/equivalence/for-of-assign-destructuring-primitive.test.ts` -- New equivalence tests

### Tests now passing
- `for ([{ x }] of [[{ x: 2 }]])` -- nested obj in array assignment destructuring
- All 7 new equivalence tests pass
- No regressions in existing for-of, destructuring, or object tests
