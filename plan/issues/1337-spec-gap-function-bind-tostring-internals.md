# #1337 — Function objects: bind, toString, length, internals

## Problem

`built-ins/Function`: **207 / 509 (40.7%) — 301 fails** (assertion_fail=122, type_error=65,
runtime_error=43, other=30, wasm_compile=21).

`built-ins/Function/internals`: **1 / 8 (12.5%) — 7 fails**.

Spec §20.2 (Function objects) requires:
1. **`Function.prototype.bind`** (§20.2.3.2): produce a bound function whose
   - `[[BoundTargetFunction]]` is the original
   - `[[BoundThis]]` is set
   - `[[BoundArguments]]` is the partial-application arg list
   - `length` is `max(0, target.length - boundArgs.length)`
   - `name` is `"bound " + target.name`
2. **`Function.prototype.toString`** (§20.2.3.6): return either the source text or a
   `"function name() { [native code] }"` representation for built-ins.
3. **`length`** is the count of formal parameters before the first default-valued or rest param.
4. **`name`** is the binding name (or computed-property name in a class).

Current state:
- `bind` produces a callable, but `length` and `name` aren't recomputed.
- `toString` returns an opaque marker, not the original source — fails any spec test that
  parses the result with `eval`.
- `Function/internals` tests check the [[Call]] / [[Construct]] receiver semantics; we throw
  TypeError on receivers we shouldn't (e.g., calling a bound function with the wrong this).

## Acceptance criteria

1. `built-ins/Function/prototype/bind/length.js` passes.
2. `built-ins/Function/prototype/bind/name.js` passes.
3. `built-ins/Function/prototype/bind/instance-name.js` passes.
4. `built-ins/Function/prototype/toString/built-in-function-object.js` passes.
5. Pass-rate for `built-ins/Function` rises from 40.7% to ≥65%.

## Files to modify

- `src/codegen/closures.ts` — bind closure struct (add length/name fields)
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — function metadata (length, name, source)
- `src/runtime.ts` — `__function_to_string` (returns source or native marker)

## Implementation Plan

### Root cause

`bind` is implemented as a thin externref wrapper that forwards to host `Function.prototype.bind`
when the receiver is externref, and as a closure-allocating Wasm helper for typed functions —
but the typed helper allocates a generic closure struct with no `length` or `name` fields,
so accessing them returns the **target's** values (wrong by spec).

`toString` for compiled-Wasm functions has no source-text reference (the source is parsed and
then discarded). We need to either:
1. Keep the source-text alive in a string table, or
2. Re-emit a synthetic `"function name() { [native code] }"`.

### Approach

1. Extend the bound-function closure struct with `length: i32` and `name: ref string` fields.
   Compute them at the bind callsite when arg count is statically known; otherwise emit an
   inline computation.
2. For `toString`, store a per-function source-text string in a side-table indexed by function
   index. Load it on demand in `__function_to_string`. Fall back to `[native code]` for
   imported/host functions.

### Edge cases

- bind on arrow function (no `this` binding) — bind succeeds; the resulting `this` is ignored.
- bind on a class constructor — must be callable with `new`.
- name on anonymous function (let f = function(){}) is the binding name `"f"`.

### Test262 sample

- `test262/test/built-ins/Function/prototype/bind/length.js`
- `test262/test/built-ins/Function/prototype/toString/built-in-function-object.js`

## Investigation notes (2026-05-08, dev-1303)

### Current bind dispatch (stub at calls.ts:1004-1022)

`compileCallExpression` already intercepts `<receiver>.bind(args)` when the
receiver has a TS call signature. The stub:

```ts
if (propAccess.name.text === "bind" && !immediateCall) {
  // drop all args
  for (const arg of expr.arguments) {
    const t = compileExpression(ctx, fctx, arg);
    if (t !== null) fctx.body.push({ op: "drop" });
  }
  // compile receiver as externref, return as-is
  const recvType = compileExpression(ctx, fctx, propAccess.expression, { kind: "externref" });
  if (recvType === null) fctx.body.push({ op: "ref.null.extern" });
  else if (recvType.kind !== "externref") fctx.body.push({ op: "extern.convert_any" });
  return { kind: "externref" };
}
```

**Effect**: `fn.bind(thisArg, …args)` evaluates and discards `thisArg`/`…args`,
returns the original `fn` unchanged. Calls on the result work because the
receiver is still callable, but `result.length` and `result.name` are wrong
(they're the target's), and `(new result(...))` won't propagate
`[[BoundThis]]` / `[[BoundArguments]]`.

### What already passes

- `built-ins/Function/prototype/bind/length.js` — `Function.prototype.bind.length === 1`. Tests the BUILT-IN, not bound functions.
- `built-ins/Function/prototype/bind/name.js` — `Function.prototype.bind.name === "bind"`. Tests the BUILT-IN.

### What fails (sample, headline acceptance criteria 3 + 4)

- `bind/instance-name.js` → `assert.sameValue(target.bind().name, 'bound target')`
  — current return is the unbound target, so `.name === "target"`. Returns
  status:fail, error_category:assertion_fail.
- `toString/built-in-function-object.js` → `TypeError (null/undefined access):
  toString of built-in Function object`. The compiled wasm reaches a path
  that calls toString on a wasm-struct without a registered toString.

### Failure-pattern frequency (built-ins/Function, current baseline)

```
122  assertion_fail
 65  type_error
 43  runtime_error
 30  other
 16  null_deref
 12  wasm_compile
  4  range_error
```

Top error messages:

```
 28  "Bind must be called on a function"  (V8's error — wasm-struct passed to host bind)
 19  "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'apply')"
 16  "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'call')"
 30  "Cannot access property on null or undefined"  (mostly L41:3 / L55:3)
  8  "dereferencing a null pointer"
```

The 28 "Bind must be called on a function" failures come from
`Function.prototype.bind.call(wasm_struct)` — V8 sees the wasm-struct as
non-function and rejects. Fixing requires either (a) wrapping the
wasm-struct in a real JS function before bind, or (b) implementing bind
ourselves and returning a wasm closure struct that carries
`[[BoundTargetFunction]]`, `[[BoundThis]]`, `[[BoundArguments]]`, and
exposes the right `length` / `name` to property reads.

### Recommended implementation (revised from original plan)

Two complementary slices, in dispatch order:

**Slice A — wasm-struct-aware bind dispatch (calls.ts:1004)**

Replace the stub with a host-side helper call:

1. Add `__function_bind` host import: takes `(target_extref,
   thisArg_extref, args_array_extref) → bound_extref`.
2. Inside `__function_bind` (runtime.ts):
   - If `target` is a wasm-struct: wrap it via `wrapForHost` (#1308) into a
     JS function, then call `Function.prototype.bind.call(wrapper, thisArg,
     ...args)` — V8 produces a real bound function with correct
     `length` / `name` / `[[Construct]]`. Return the bound JS function as
     externref.
   - Else (already a JS function): `Function.prototype.bind.call(target,
     thisArg, ...args)` — direct path.
3. The codegen at calls.ts:1004 builds an args-array externref (via the
   existing `__create_array` import or inline `array.new_fixed`), pushes
   target + thisArg + args-array, calls `__function_bind`.

This eliminates the 28 "Bind must be called on a function" failures AND
fixes `bind/instance-name.js` because V8's bind sets `name = "bound " +
target.name` automatically — so as long as the target's wrapper has the
right `.name`, the bound function inherits it. (#1308's `wrapForHost`
already preserves the function name from `mod.functions[i].name`.)

**Slice B — toString source-text retention (runtime.ts + index.ts)**

For `toString/built-in-function-object.js`, V8's spec requires
`Function.prototype.toString` to return either the original source text
(for source-defined functions) or a string of the form `"function name() {
[native code] }"` (for built-ins).

1. Compile-time: store the source text of each user-defined function in a
   side table indexed by funcIdx. At codegen time, capture
   `funcDecl.getText()` (or the body range) into
   `ctx.functionSourceText: Map<number, string>`.
2. Emit `mod.imports[].name === "__function_source_text"` host import that
   takes `(funcref) → externref` (the source string).
3. In runtime.ts, implement `__function_to_string`:
   - If the externref wraps a wasm function: look up its funcref in a
     reverse-map (funcref → source text), return that.
   - Else: forward to `Function.prototype.toString.call(target)`.
4. The bound-function path inherits via slice A: V8 itself handles
   `boundFn.toString()`.

### Scope estimate

- Slice A: ~150 LoC (calls.ts dispatch + runtime.ts host helper +
  args-array handling). Unblocks ~30 tests.
- Slice B: ~200 LoC (functionSourceText map, host import wiring,
  reverse-lookup table). Unblocks `toString/*` tests (~40 in the
  bind+toString clusters).

Reaching the 65% acceptance gate (~125 additional passes) likely needs
both slices PLUS the remaining null-deref / type_error cluster
investigation — those are "Cannot read properties of null (reading
'apply'/'call')" patterns where the receiver is a wasm-struct flowing
into an apply / call site that can't dispatch through the normal closure
path. That cluster overlaps with #1311 (Map<string, AsyncHandler>
dispatch) and #1312 (recursive nested fn self-reference, in PR #257
currently), both of which improve closure-chain visibility — landing
those first will reduce the bind / toString work surface.

### Risks

- `wrapForHost` for bind needs all closure-typed values to round-trip
  through V8's bind. If the wrapper drops captures (which would break
  `(boundFn)()` semantics), this slice produces non-functional bound
  functions. Verify via probe before committing to host-bind dispatch.
- Source-text retention adds compile-time bytes (each user-defined
  function holds a string copy). For typical programs this is bounded by
  source size; for generated code it's a non-issue.

### Implementation attempt notes (2026-05-08, dev-1303 — REVERTED)

A first-cut Slice A was implemented locally and reverted. Findings the
next implementer should pre-empt:

1. `_wrapForHost(struct)` returns a `Proxy`, whose `typeof` is `"object"`,
   not `"function"`. V8's `Function.prototype.bind` rejects non-function
   targets ("Bind must be called on a function"). Use a real JS function
   that closes over the wasm struct instead, mirroring
   `wrapExports.makeCallableClosureWrapper` — see runtime.ts:4398.
2. The `__call_fn_0` / `__call_fn_1` exports are emitted only when the
   module has at least one zero- / one-arg closure registered. Wrappers
   for higher-arity targets must dispatch differently or accept
   incomplete-args fallback (`__call_fn_0` ignores extras, matching the
   `wrapExports` precedent). For bind itself this is acceptable since
   bind doesn't invoke the target — V8 only reads `length` / `name` to
   compute the bound function's metadata.
3. **The blocking issue**: when the bind result is a JS bound function
   (externref) but the LHS local is typed as the target's closure struct
   ref (which TS infers as the bound function's TS type), the assignment
   site emits a `coerceType(externref → ref struct)` chain (`any.convert_extern;
   ref.test; if/else { ref.cast | ref.null }; extern.convert_any`). The
   cast fails because the JS function isn't a wasm struct, so the LHS
   local gets `ref.null.extern`. Result: `bound` is null. Verified with
   a 5-test probe — the metadata restamping (`length`/`name`) on the
   wrapper before bind works, but `const bound = target.bind(undefined)`
   stores null because of this LHS-coerce regression.
4. Slice A's host route therefore needs a complementary codegen change:
   when a CallExpression's result is "host bind" (or any host helper
   returning a JS-functional externref), the LHS local must be declared
   externref, NOT the closure struct ref TS would otherwise infer. Two
   ways to do this:
   (a) Tag the bind dispatch's return so the parent assignment skips the
       coerce-to-closure-struct step (extend the existing
       `compileVariableDeclaration` / coerce path with a "host bind"
       sentinel).
   (b) Build a synthetic wasm closure struct around the bound JS
       function — store the bound externref in a field, build a
       trampoline that does `__extern_method_call(self.bound, "call",
       args)` for invocation. Restamp length/name via Object.defineProperty
       on the trampoline before bind (or inline). Wider blast radius but
       preserves the closure-struct type identity the LHS coerce expects.
5. Source-text retention (Slice B) wasn't attempted; orthogonal to the
   bind LHS-coerce issue.

### Status

Investigation complete; implementation deferred pending a fix for point
(3) above. A dev picking this up should start by deciding (a) vs (b),
then implement Slice A on top of it. The metadata-restamp logic
(`Object.defineProperty(wrapper, "length"|"name", ...)` after building
the JS wrapper, before `Function.prototype.bind.call`) is straight
JavaScript and doesn't need debugging — the open question is the
codegen / coerce side.

## Progress (2026-05-28, dev-1337-bind-call)

Two slices landed since the original investigation:

1. **Slice A landed via #1632a (PR #796, commit `feb4c7697`)** —
   `__bind_function` host helper + the `.bind(...)` direct-form dispatch
   at `calls.ts:~2389` (`compileFunctionBind`). Wasm-struct receivers are
   wrapped via `_wrapWasmClosure` and stamped with codegen-supplied
   `nameHint` / `lengthHint` before delegating to the host's
   `Function.prototype.bind`. The bound result is a real JS bound-function
   exotic with correct `.name === "bound " + target.name`,
   `.length === max(0, target.length - boundArgs.length)`, `[[Call]]`,
   `[[Construct]]`.

2. **Partial Slice B landed via #1463 (`funcSourceText` map)** —
   `Function.prototype.toString()` on top-level function declarations
   returns the captured source text. Anything else (built-ins, method
   refs, arrow functions, expressions) still gets the
   `"function () { [native code] }"` placeholder. The placeholder is
   spec-compliant for built-ins per §20.2.3.6 (NativeFunction grammar);
   only "the toString of a user-defined arrow / method expression"
   diverges from spec.

### Current baseline (origin/main @ 4f536e4a9, 2026-05-28)

- `built-ins/Function/prototype/bind`: 28 / 100 (28.0%)
- `built-ins/Function/prototype/toString`: 71 / 80 (**88.8%**) —
  effectively met by the Slice A + #1463 partial Slice B combination.
- `built-ins/Function/internals`: 3 / 8 (37.5%) — was 1 / 8 at the
  original issue baseline.
- `built-ins/Function` (excl. prototype subtrees): 115 / 321 (35.8%).

### This change: indirect `Function.prototype.bind.call` reshape

Top failure pattern in the bind bucket is "Bind must be called on a
function" (~30 tests) from the `Function.prototype.bind.call(fn, thisArg,
...args)` form, which `compileFunctionBind` doesn't intercept because the
outer call's `propAccess.name === "call"`, not `"bind"`. This change
mirrors the existing #1596 reshape for `Function.prototype.apply.call`:
detect the indirect shape and rewrite to `fn.bind(thisArg, ...args)`, so
the existing #1632a dispatch fires.

Two edits in `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`:

1. At `~2369` (top of `compileCallExpression`'s `propAccess` block):
   reshape `Function.prototype.bind.call(fn, ...)` → `fn.bind(...)` and
   recurse. Narrowed to `fn` targets that have TS call signatures, so
   `Function.prototype.bind.call(undefined, {})` still throws TypeError
   per S15.3.4.5_A13 (the legacy host path catches it).

2. At `~9402` (immediate-bind+call peephole): also accept the indirect
   shape so `Function.prototype.bind.call(fn, thisArg, ...partials)
   (...remaining)` reshapes inline before the existing identifier-bind
   detection runs. This unlocks the IIFE-inlining path for the indirect
   form — same wins as `fn.bind(thisArg, ...partials)(...remaining)`
   already gets.

### Outcome

- Eliminates "Bind must be called on a function" V8 rejection for the
  indirect form (~30 tests' error category changes from `runtime_error`
  to `assertion_fail` — they now reach the assertion phase).
- Enables immediate-call optimization for the indirect form (verified
  with `tests/issue-1337-bind-call.test.ts`).
- **Does NOT flip the bulk of those ~30 tests to PASS** — most use the
  `var newFunc = bind.call(...); newFunc()` deferred pattern, which
  hits the broader #1632a documented var-storage gap: an `any`-typed
  local that stores an externref bound function doesn't dispatch on a
  later `()` call (returns null). That gap requires a separate fix
  (either an `__extern_call` host helper for `any`-typed locals, or
  type narrowing on the bind result so the LHS doesn't coerce to a
  closure-struct ref). Tracked under #1632a as the open Layer-2 work.

### Tests added

- `tests/issue-1337-bind-call.test.ts` — 8 cases covering metadata
  reads (typeof / .length / .name), immediate-call shape with partials
  (number + string), the negative spec gate (Math.max.call unaffected).

### Out of scope

- Source-text retention beyond identifier receivers — #1463 covers
  top-level declarations; the remaining toString gap is concentrated
  in the `built-in-function-object.js` Reflect-walk pattern which is
  a broad-surface workload, not a localized fix.

## Layer-2 fix: bound-function variable storage + invocation (2026-05-29)

This change closes the var-storage round-trip the prior progress note
flagged as out-of-scope (#1632a notes point 3). `const bound =
fn.bind(...); bound()` previously trapped with "dereferencing a null
pointer" because:

1. `bound`'s local was typed (via `resolveWasmType`) as the target's
   **closure-struct ref** — the bound result is a JS bound-function
   externref, so `coerceType(externref → struct ref)` emitted a
   `ref.cast` that nulled the binding.
2. Calling `bound()` then built a closure-wrapper struct from the TS
   signature and did `any.convert_extern` + guarded cast + `struct.get`
   field-0 — the guarded cast yields null on the JS function, so the
   subsequent `struct.get`/`call_ref` dereferenced null.

Three edits:

- **`src/codegen/statements/variables.ts`** — `isBindHostCall` detector
  forces an **externref** local for `const/let/var x = fn.bind(...)` (and
  the `Function.prototype.bind.call` form), mirroring the existing
  Promise/`split` host-call overrides. A follow-on guard in the callable
  initializer branch keeps the value externref instead of match-and-
  recasting it to a closure struct.
- **`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`** — `calleeIsBoundFunctionVar`
  detects a call whose callee variable was initialized from `.bind(...)`,
  and `emitBoundFunctionCall` routes the invocation through the new
  `__call_function` host helper (Reflect.apply on the bound function,
  which already carries `[[BoundThis]]`/`[[BoundArguments]]`).
- **`src/runtime.ts`** — `__call_function(fn, thisArg, argsArray)` host
  import: `Reflect.apply`, unwrapping a wasm-struct closure if one slips
  through. JS-host mode only; standalone degrades bind to identity so
  the normal closure path applies.

### Measured outcome (scoped test262, `built-ins/Function/`)

- **+20 passes, 0 regressions** on the 324 common files vs the pre-change
  run. All newly-passing are `prototype/bind/15.3.4.5*` invocation tests
  (`newFunc()` returning bound `this`, partial-arg application,
  `[[Call]]` receiver semantics).
- The 65% acceptance gate remains **out of reach for this bucket**:
  ~90 of the ~213 remaining failures depend on the dynamic `Function(...)`
  / `new Function(...)` constructor (eval territory, `deferred-feature`),
  and ~37 are the strict-mode `caller`/`arguments` poison-pill
  (`15.3.5.4_2-*gs.js`) tests — both distinct from bind/toString.

### Still out of scope (after this fix)

- `new boundFn()` construct semantics (`15.3.4.5.2-4-*` — "No dependency
  provided for extern class NewFunc") — needs bound-function `[[Construct]]`
  wiring through the wasm `new` path.
- Binding a function that *returns* `this` where the target isn't wrapped
  as a closure struct (the `__call_fn_<arity>` lazy-bridge edge): the
  partial-args / value-returning cases work; the bound-`this`-identity
  case for an un-wrappable top-level target still needs the bridge export.
- Dynamic `Function(...)` constructor and strict poison-pill tests
  (separate features).

### Tests added

- `tests/issue-1337.test.ts` — extended with deferred-storage metadata
  cases (already present); the invocation wins are covered by the scoped
  test262 run above.
