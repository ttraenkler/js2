# #1235 — ci: prevent baseline drift false-positive regressions after admin-merges

## Problem

Three consecutive PRs (#142, #143, #144) all showed 22–28 "real" (wasm_change)
regressions simultaneously, even though:

- PR #143 was **entirely env-gated** (`JS2WASM_IR_OBJECT_SHAPES=1`): zero lines
  of production codegen changed. It is impossible for it to produce real Wasm
  regressions. Yet CI reported 27 `regressions_wasm_change`.
- All three PRs showed the same 22–28 range, which is a symmetric pattern
  across unrelated branches.

Root cause: **baselines-repo JSONL drift**. The `loopdive/js2wasm-baselines`
repo JSONL is refreshed by the `promote-baseline` job inside `test262-sharded.yml`,
which runs on push to `main`. Admin-merges (`gh pr merge --admin`) bypass the
normal PR-then-push flow and land commits tagged `[skip ci]`, so the
`test262-sharded.yml` workflow never fires on those merges. The baselines JSONL
then drifts against actual main HEAD, and every subsequent PR CI run compares
against a stale "pass" set — causing some tests that _now fail on main_ to show
up as regressions in every PR branch.

**Current state of drift**: After admin-merges of PRs #138–#143, the baselines
JSONL is potentially hundreds of tests stale. Every PR CI run flags those stale
entries as regressions, polluting the noise filter and requiring manual cross-PR
analysis to distinguish real from drift.

## Acceptance criteria

1. After every merge to `main` (including admin-merges), a baseline refresh is
   triggered automatically — no manual intervention needed.
2. Subsequent PR CI runs see ≤ 2 spurious `regressions_wasm_change` from drift
   (effectively zero between refreshes).
3. The fix does not add wall-clock cost to the PR gate CI path.
4. `[skip ci]` commits (doc/plan updates) must NOT trigger a full test262 sharded
   run — only the lightweight refresh workflow.

## Implementation plan

### Option A (recommended): trigger `refresh-committed-baseline.yml` on push to main

`refresh-committed-baseline.yml` already exists and does the right thing:
1. Downloads the latest successful `Test262 Sharded` artifact from main
2. Commits it back as the new baseline with `[skip ci]`

The gap: it's currently only triggered manually (via `workflow_dispatch`). Add a
`push` trigger filtered to `main` branch and excluding `[skip ci]` commits:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

**Problem with this alone**: admin-merges themselves may have `[skip ci]` in
their commit message, and GitHub's push trigger fires based on the commit that
landed, not the PR it came from. Need to check whether admin-merge commits
include `[skip ci]`.

If admin-merge commits do NOT include `[skip ci]`: the `push` trigger alone is
sufficient.

If they do: use a `workflow_run` trigger instead, keyed on the `Test262 Sharded`
workflow completing successfully on `main`:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Test262 Sharded"]
    types: [completed]
    branches: [main]
```

This fires after any successful `test262-sharded.yml` run on main and ensures
the baselines are always a post-test-run snapshot.

### Option B: add a `promote-baseline` call at the end of `test262-sharded.yml` on push

The `promote-baseline` job in `test262-sharded.yml` already pushes to
`loopdive/js2wasm-baselines`. Make it also commit the refreshed JSONL back to
the main repo via `refresh-committed-baseline.yml` dispatch call.

This is currently what happens on normal CI pushes; the gap is only for
admin-merges where `test262-sharded.yml` never runs at all.

### Option C: detect stale baselines in the PR gate

In `test262-ci.yml` (or equivalent), before comparing regressions:
1. Fetch the age of the baselines JSONL (last commit timestamp in
   `loopdive/js2wasm-baselines`)
2. If baselines are older than main HEAD by more than N commits, emit a warning
   and adjust the noise threshold or skip the wasm_change comparison
3. Post a PR comment warning that regressions may be baseline drift

This is a softer fix — it doesn't prevent drift, it just makes the CI output
honest about it. Combine with Option A for best results.

### Recommended implementation

1. **Primary**: Option A — add `workflow_run` trigger to
   `refresh-committed-baseline.yml` so it fires after every successful
   `Test262 Sharded` run on main.
2. **Secondary**: Option C's staleness warning in the PR gate, so drift is
   visible in CI output even if the refresh hasn't fired yet.

## Files to change

- `.github/workflows/refresh-committed-baseline.yml` — add `workflow_run`
  trigger (primary fix)
- `.github/workflows/test262-ci.yml` (or equivalent PR gate workflow) —
  optionally add staleness warning (Option C)
