# #624 — Wasm struct type errors: struct.new/struct.get mismatches (1,092 CE)

## Status: open

1,092 tests fail with Wasm validation errors related to struct operations:
- `struct.new` with wrong number of fields
- `struct.get` on a reference that isn't the expected struct type
- Type mismatch between struct field type and value on stack

### Root cause
Class inheritance and struct type registration don't always produce compatible types. When a child class adds fields, the parent struct type doesn't match.

### Fix
Ensure struct type compatibility in class hierarchies. May need struct subtyping or ref.cast before struct operations.

## Complexity: M
