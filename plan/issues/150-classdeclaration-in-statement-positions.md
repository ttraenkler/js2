# #150 — ClassDeclaration in statement positions

## Problem
Classes declared inside `for` loops, `if` blocks, or other statement positions
caused "Unsupported statement: ClassDeclaration" errors because `compileStatement`
did not handle `ClassDeclaration` nodes.

## Fix
- Exported `collectClassDeclaration` and `compileClassBodies` from `src/codegen/index.ts`
- Added `compileNestedClassDeclaration` handler in `src/codegen/statements.ts`
  that collects the class struct/methods and compiles their bodies immediately
- Skips if the class was already collected (e.g., top-level hoisted)

## Tests
- Added "class inside if block" equivalence test

## Status: Done
