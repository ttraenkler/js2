# #910 -- Split expressions.ts into syntax-family modules

## Problem

[src/codegen/expressions.ts](src/codegen/expressions.ts) is currently the single largest source file in the compiler at over 18k lines.

It contains unrelated responsibilities in one file:

- identifier reads and TDZ logic
- call lowering
- assignment and destructuring assignment
- logical operators and unary operators
- `new`/class/super handling
- console/Date/WASI host behavior
- generator/yield support
- inline import-fixup helpers

This is a major contributor deterrent: newcomers must navigate thousands of lines before they can make a local change confidently.

## Goal

Split expression lowering into smaller modules organized by expression family and runtime domain.

## Requirements

1. Introduce a directory-oriented structure under `src/codegen/expressions/`
2. Separate at least these domains:
   - identifiers and simple reads
   - calls and optional calls
   - assignments and destructuring assignments
   - unary/logical/conditional operators
   - property/super/new handling
   - generator/yield support
   - host-specific builtins such as console/Date/WASI
3. Keep a small `expressions/index.ts` dispatcher as the public entry point
4. Avoid creating a new set of implicit circular imports while splitting
5. Preserve current tests and regressions

## Acceptance criteria

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` is removed or reduced to a small compatibility barrel
- expression lowering is organized into discoverable feature modules
- a contributor can add or fix one expression family without reading most of the file
