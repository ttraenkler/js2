origin: surfaced during PR #72 / #74 baseline-drift investigation (2026-04-27). Initial hypothesis was cache-key staleness, but cache-key invalidation was already correctly handled by #1171. Real cause is residual runner-load non-determinism near the 30s compile-timeout boundary.

# #1189 — Residual cross-PR regression overlap is runner-load CT noise

## Background — what's already fixed (#1171)

PR #1171 (`e50f4c2fd`, 2026-04-24) addressed the cache-key invalidation
problem head-on:

  1. Bumped vitest `testTimeout` from 10s → 35s, so tests near the
     compiler's internal 30s timeout don't flap due to vitest beating
     the compiler's timeout to the punch.
  2. Added `vitest.config.ts` to the cache-key `hashFiles(...)` inputs,
     so any change to concurrency / timeout / pool config busts the
     cache.

The cache key is currently:

```yaml
key: test262-cache-v2-${{ hashFiles('src/**/*.ts', 'scripts/test262-worker.mjs', 'scripts/compiler-fork-worker.mjs', 'vitest.config.ts') }}-chunk-${{ matrix.chunk }}
```

The `restore-keys` fallback only matches entries with the SAME
hashFiles result (same compiler), different chunk. That's correct
behavior — same-code recovery, not cross-code leakage.

So **the cache cannot leak across compiler changes**. Cross-PR
regression overlap from cache staleness is structurally impossible
under #1171's fix.

## What we observed during PR #72 / #74

Despite #1171's fix:

  - PR #72 (IR refactor) pass→CE: 233
  - PR #74 (legacy single-site fix, completely different code path) pass→CE: 227
  - Overlap: 222 (95%)

PRs #72 and #74 have different src hashes, hence different cache
keys. The cache is irrelevant to their overlap. So where does the
95% come from?

## Diagnosis: runner-load CT noise

Roughly half of each PR's "regressions" are pass→`compile_timeout`
transitions (PR #72: 117/233; PR #74: 106/227). These are tests
that compile in 25-35 seconds — right at the boundary of the
compiler's internal 30s timeout.

Under any given CI run's CPU contention, a fixed set of these
borderline tests will time out. The set is mostly the same across
runs because:

  - The same tests are computationally expensive (regardless of
    which PR is on the branch).
  - The runner schedules tests in the same chunk order.
  - GitHub Actions runners have similar CPU profiles.

Result: cross-PR regression overlap is dominated by these CT-flapping
tests that have nothing to do with either PR's actual diff. The
underlying fix is to stop counting CT in the gate (or fix the
underlying flap), not to bust the cache more aggressively.

## Where this goes

This issue closes the "is it cache?" investigation. The actionable
fixes are:

  - **#1192** (CT classification in self-merge gate) — split CT
    from CE/fail in the regression count. Pulls the runner-noise
    contribution out of the merge metric. Highest ROI.
  - **#1190** (research umbrella) — measure the residual drift
    after #1192 and decide whether further runner-side fixes
    (compile-timeout bump, isolated-CPU runners, retry-on-CT) are
    worthwhile.
  - **#1191** (committed baseline refresh) — orthogonal: the
    committed `test262-current.jsonl` is 1634 tests behind reality
    and confuses the secondary gate path.

## Recommendation

Mark this issue as **investigation complete / wont-fix-this-way**.
The diagnostic value of this report is:

  1. Cache-key was already addressed correctly by #1171 — don't
     touch it again unless we find a NEW failure mode.
  2. The remaining 95%-overlap regression noise across unrelated PRs
     is CT-flapping, not stale data.
  3. Effort should focus on #1192 (gate the metric properly) and
     #1190 (measure post-fix residual).

If, after #1192 lands, cross-PR overlap is still > 30% on
non-CT-only regressions, **then** something deeper is happening and
we re-open this. Until then: closed.

## Acceptance criteria

1. After #1192 lands, run two consecutive `main` builds (or
   compare two close-in-time PRs from the same `main` HEAD) and
   confirm overlap of CE/fail-only regressions is < 30%.
2. Document the diagnosis in this issue file (this issue is its
   own diagnostic record).
3. Move to wont-fix or done when criterion 1 is verified.

## Notes

- The `feedback_baseline_drift_cross_check.md` memory note
  describes the CROSS-CHECK technique (compare regressions across
  PRs to detect drift). It does NOT prescribe a fix for the drift
  source itself. This issue (and #1192) addresses the source.

- I (dev-1182) wrote an earlier version of this issue blaming the
  cache-key. That hypothesis was wrong; the actual cause is runner
  CT noise. The investigation history is preserved in this file
  so future devs don't re-walk the same dead-end.
