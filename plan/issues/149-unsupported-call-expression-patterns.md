# #149 — Unsupported call expression patterns

## Status: open

## Problem
637 test262 compile errors from "Unsupported call expression". These include various call patterns the compiler doesn't handle:
- Method calls on unknown types
- Chained method calls: `obj.method().other()`
- Calls with complex receiver expressions
- `Function.prototype.call/apply/bind`

This is a broad category. A triage pass is needed to identify the most common sub-patterns.

## Tests blocked
~637 compile errors (largest single error category)

## Complexity: L
