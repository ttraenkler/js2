# #487 — User Symbol as property key via tagged struct variant (~60 tests)

## Status: open

~60 tests use user-created Symbols as property keys (`obj[sym] = value`). This requires runtime-keyed property storage, which WasmGC structs don't natively support.

## Approach: Tagged struct variant

At compile time, detect objects that use symbol-keyed properties and add an extra field:

```
struct Object {
  field $name (ref string)
  field $value f64
  field $__symbol_props (ref null $SymbolMap)  // only on tagged variants
}
```

Where `$SymbolMap` is `Map<i32, externref>` (symbol id → value).

### Compile-time detection
1. Scan the AST for `obj[expr]` where `expr` is typed as `symbol` or is a `Symbol()` call
2. If found, add `__symbol_props` field to that object's struct definition
3. Property access `obj[sym]` compiles to: check if sym is a known well-known symbol (use field index), otherwise look up in `__symbol_props` map

### Runtime behavior
- `obj[sym] = value` → `map.set(sym_id, box(value))`
- `obj[sym]` → `map.get(sym_id)` with unbox
- `sym in obj` → `map.has(sym_id)`
- `delete obj[sym]` → `map.delete(sym_id)`

### Cost
- Zero overhead for objects that don't use symbol keys (no extra field)
- Objects with symbol keys pay one Map allocation + per-access map lookup
- Well-known symbols (#481) still use direct field access (no map penalty)

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `const s = Symbol(); obj[s] = 42; obj[s] === 42` works
- [ ] Objects without symbol usage have no extra field (no regression)
- [ ] Well-known symbols still resolve to direct struct fields
- [ ] `s in obj` and `delete obj[s]` work for symbol keys
