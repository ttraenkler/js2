# Issue 102: Test262 — language/expressions remaining

## Summary

Add the remaining `language/expressions` subcategories to the test262 runner.
The current coverage is heavy on operators but misses expression forms for
object/array literals, arrow functions, classes, spread, template literals,
and the `new` operator.

## Categories to add

| Category | Feature | Status in compiler |
|---|---|---|
| `language/expressions/new` | `new` operator | ✅ done |
| `language/expressions/arrow-function` | arrow functions | ✅ done (#7, #11) |
| `language/expressions/class` | class expressions | ✅ done (#57) |
| `language/expressions/object` | object literals | ✅ done (#77) |
| `language/expressions/array` | array literals | ✅ done |
| `language/expressions/template-literal` | template literals | ✅ done (#13) |
| `language/expressions/spread` | spread operator | ✅ done (#18) |
| `language/expressions/generators` | generator expressions | ✅ done (#64) |
| `language/expressions/async-arrow-function` | async arrow functions | ✅ done (#30) |
| `language/expressions/async-function` | async function expressions | ✅ done (#30) |

## Approach

1. Add each category to `TEST_CATEGORIES` in `tests/test262-runner.ts`
2. Run and inspect pass/fail/skip breakdown per category
3. Add skip filters for unsupported edge cases:
   - `new.target`, `import()`, `super()` outside class
   - Arrow functions with destructured parameters
   - Object methods with computed keys or shorthand generators
   - Template literal tagged templates
   - Spread into `new` expressions
