# #3523 — IR-only R4: typed ordered module-init compile-once ownership

## Objective

Make top-level evaluation a typed, ordered unit of `PreparedIrProgram` before
any body emitter runs. A non-empty single-source program receives exactly one
terminal module-init outcome:

- **Prepared** — lower and emit one IR-owned `__module_init` body;
- **Unsupported** — under the temporary hybrid policy, compile one direct body;
- **Invariant** — fail before publication; never retain or patch another body.

Replace the current filter-a-statement-list, compile direct twice, then patch by
the string `__module_init` model. Preserve observable source order, TDZ and live
binding behavior, class static evaluation, host/deferred/WASI startup policy,
and exactly-once side effects. R4 is complete only when a Prepared module-init
has `direct=0, IR=1` and an Unsupported module-init has `direct=1, IR=0`.

## Current evidence

The existing module-init claim is an overlay over a legacy ABI and body:

- `src/ir/module-init.ts:8-27` only filters a `SourceFile` into a flat statement
  population. It excludes class declarations and therefore cannot represent
  their ordered static field/block effects. At `:30-40` it wraps that population
  in a synthetic function named `<module-init>`.
- `src/codegen/declarations.ts:2076-2105` mutates TDZ analysis state and
  allocates `__tdz_*` globals before module-init compilation.
- `src/codegen/declarations.ts:2108-2117` derives three side channels — module
  statements, reassigned-function live seeds, and class static initializers —
  rather than one ordered program plan.
- `src/codegen/declarations.ts:2119-2148` snapshots four order-sensitive maps
  solely because the body is compiled twice. `compileModuleInitBody` at
  `:2150-2229` emits all live seeds, then all static initializers/blocks, then
  all module statements through direct `compileExpression` / `compileStatement`.
- The first direct compile occurs at `src/codegen/declarations.ts:2232-2237`;
  the second occurs at `:2351-2360` after top-level functions populate the
  inlining registry. Both mutate compiler state even though only the later body
  is shipped.
- `src/codegen/declarations.ts:2366-2441` allocates `__module_init`, exports it
  for `deferTopLevelInit`, or wires it to the Wasm start section. Multi-source
  compilation currently replaces earlier same-name exports at `:2420-2430`.
- `src/ir/integration.ts:498-580` refuses static initializers and live-function
  seeds, requires legacy-allocated numeric/boolean globals, and builds IR only
  after the direct slot exists. Build failure demotes back to that body.
- `src/ir/integration.ts:921-970` finds `__module_init` by flat display name,
  checks its legacy-created type index, and patches the existing function.
- `src/codegen/index.ts:3750-3863` subsequently mutates the body for the
  in-module flag and WASI idempotency guard. At `:3865-4043`, `_start` selection
  and reactor/error tails locate `main`/`__module_init` by name and decide when
  initialization runs.

#3142 made a narrow initializer population claimable. #3517 removes the last
measured Algorithms initializer residual. Neither proves compile-once
ownership, includes the omitted side channels, or makes the legacy slot dead.

## Typed `ModuleInitPlan` contract

R4 adds one source-qualified `ModuleInitPlan` to the R2 `PreparedIrProgram`.
The plan is built from source positions plus R1 identities/ABI slots; it is not
reconstructed from mutable codegen queues. It records, in semantic order:

1. **Instantiation/prelude intents** — function live-binding seeds and other
   hoisted binding state that must exist before user evaluation.
2. **Binding storage and TDZ intents** — `IrBindingId`, planned global/local
   storage, initialization state, mutability, and source-located TDZ actions.
3. **Ordered evaluation entries** — variable initializers, executable
   statements, class evaluation, static fields, and static blocks, each with a
   source ordinal and the owning `IrUnitId` / `IrClassId`.
4. **Export/live-alias intents** — the canonical binding/slot an export or
   reassigned function observes; aliases do not create a second initializer.
5. **Invocation policy** — ordinary host Wasm start, deferred host export,
   standalone, or WASI `_start`/export guard, including exactly-once rules.

The plan must explicitly represent an empty/non-executable module. An empty
plan is accounted for without emitting a bogus function. No entry may be
silently dropped because it has no direct-codegen queue representation.

## Ordering and ownership invariants

1. Build TDZ/storage, function/class ABI, closure captures, static intents, and
   invocation policy before either backend emits a body. All indices come from
   `ProgramAbiMap`; no lookup of `__module_init` or a source binding by name may
   allocate or discover ABI during lowering.
2. Preserve JavaScript evaluation order across interleaved statements and
   class declarations. Static fields/blocks run at their class evaluation
   position, not as an unordered queue before every top-level statement.
3. Prelude live-function seeds occur before the first observable top-level
   read, once per canonical binding/global. Reassignments update the same
   planned binding and export aliases observe it live.
4. TDZ flags/storage exist before evaluation, and each successful declaration
   transitions its binding once. An early read throws; a later read observes
   the initialized value. A failed initializer cannot look initialized.
5. A Prepared plan is sealed before emission. Any later missing binding, ABI
   slot, static entry, runtime intent, lifted function, or backend legality
   failure is an Invariant and cannot demote to the direct body.
6. An Unsupported plan is decided before emission and compiles direct exactly
   once. R2/R3's complete unit inventory replaces the first pass's closure and
   inlining discovery purpose; restoring two direct passes is forbidden.
7. Startup wiring consumes a planned init slot. Ordinary host start,
   `deferTopLevelInit`, standalone, and WASI may choose different invocation
   adapters, but no configuration may invoke the semantic body twice or omit
   it when an exported entry is called first.
8. Source-unit counters and backend-emission counters reconcile separately.
   Support wrappers, start guards, and `_start` are named support units; they do
   not inflate the one module-init source-unit denominator.

## Bounded landing sequence

### Commit 1 — ordered plan and parity inventory, no routing change

- Define `ModuleInitPlan`, entry kinds, invocation policy, and verifier.
- Build the plan beside existing queues and compare its order, bindings,
  statics, TDZ actions, live seeds, exports, and invocation mode in telemetry.
- Add failure injection for missing/duplicate/reordered entries and prove
  inventory equals one terminal outcome before touching body routing.

### Commit 2 — prepare/lower module init and make fallback one-pass

- Extend from-AST lowering for every planned top-level entry and static intent.
- Prepare/verify the complete unit before body emission and seal its runtime /
  support intents.
- Emit Prepared through IR once. When policy permits Unsupported fallback,
  compile the direct body once after program preparation; remove the snapshot /
  restore and first-pass discovery dependency.

### Commit 3 — planned ABI/start wiring and overlay retirement

- Allocate/resolve the init slot through `ProgramAbiMap` and drive Wasm start,
  deferred-host export, standalone, and WASI adapters from invocation policy.
- Remove flat-name slot discovery, legacy type-index parity patching, and both
  direct-body passes from the Prepared route.
- Delete obsolete module-init claim/patch queues only after parity and
  anti-vacuity evidence is green. Keep the one-pass direct implementation for
  temporary typed Unsupported policy until R9/R10.

## File ownership and locks

One developer owns `src/ir/module-init.ts`, `src/ir/from-ast.ts`,
`src/ir/select.ts`, `src/ir/integration.ts`, `src/codegen/declarations.ts`,
`src/codegen/index.ts`, `src/codegen/context/types.ts`, and the R2 Prepared-
program modules for the entire R4 landing. These files jointly encode ordering,
storage, slot, and invocation invariants and must not be split across parallel
implementation branches.

R3 must land first because it owns class/static-intent and closure inventory.
R5 owns multi-source aggregation; R6 owns runtime-provider semantic entry
points. Coordinate adjacent changes, but do not absorb either scope into R4.

## Anti-vacuity tests

`tests/issue-3523-ir-module-init-compile-once.test.ts` must prove:

1. Interleave observable statements, variable initializers, class declarations,
   static fields, and static blocks. The event log matches source order and
   each event occurs once in ordinary host, deferred host, standalone, and WASI.
2. A reassigned top-level function is readable before reassignment, aliases /
   exports observe the same live binding afterward, and one canonical global is
   seeded once even through multiple aliases (#2931).
3. `let`/`const` reads before initialization throw, post-initialization reads
   succeed, and a throwing initializer does not set its TDZ flag.
4. Static fields/blocks preserve `this`, inheritance, and surrounding binding
   visibility; they are represented inside the plan rather than rejected or
   prepended through `ctx.staticInitExprs`.
5. Repeated `Object.defineProperty`, `freeze`, `seal`, and
   `preventExtensions` operations see the correct program-order state without
   snapshot/restore. A counter seam proves no compiler-side init pass runs twice
   (#2965).
6. A Prepared module records `direct=0, IR=1`; a forced typed Unsupported
   module records `direct=1, IR=0`; post-Prepared failure emits neither a direct
   replacement nor a publishable artifact.
7. An empty/type-only/function-only module records an explicit non-executable
   outcome and adds no `__module_init`, start function, or duplicate export.
8. Top-level throw and side-effect failure surface once with the intended
   source location; the old non-WASI silently-dropped-throw condition cannot
   become parity evidence.
9. `deferTopLevelInit` exports one callable init without a Wasm start section;
   the normal host path uses start once; WASI calling any exported entry first
   still initializes once and `_start` does not repeat it (#1789/#2796).
10. A test seam that deletes a static entry, changes an ordinal, duplicates a
    live seed, resolves by display name, or invokes both start adapters fails
    reconciliation. Simple numeric module-init success alone is vacuous.

Run adjacent regressions from `tests/issue-3142.test.ts`,
`tests/issue-2965.test.ts`, `tests/issue-2796.test.ts`,
`tests/issue-1789-standalone-module-init.test.ts`, `tests/issue-2992.test.ts`,
and `tests/issue-3505-host-compilemulti-harness-callable-init.test.ts`. The last
is a no-regression check only; it does not close R5 multi-source ownership.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every single-source program has one typed, source-qualified module-init
      outcome before emission; its plan accounts for statements, bindings,
      statics, live seeds, exports, TDZ actions, and invocation policy.
- [ ] Prepared module init emits once through IR and never calls direct
      `compileStatement` / `compileExpression`, patches a legacy-created slot,
      or depends on first-pass compiler mutations.
- [ ] Typed Unsupported module init emits direct once only while hybrid policy
      exists. Invariants and post-Prepared failures are fatal in every policy.
- [ ] Observable top-level/class/static order, TDZ, live bindings, exports,
      side effects, exceptions, and exactly-once behavior match the semantic
      contract across host, deferred host, standalone, and WASI.
- [ ] The two-pass snapshot/restore machinery, module-init name lookup, and
      class/live-seed rejection gates are absent from the Prepared route.
- [ ] `ProgramAbiMap` owns the init function, globals, aliases, and support
      slots; startup adapters consume those identities without display-name
      collision or late allocation.
- [ ] Per-unit and per-emitter counters reconcile for executable and empty
      modules; the readiness gate fails on missing/duplicate outcomes.
- [ ] Full module-init/equivalence/cross-backend tests, typecheck, lint/format,
      merge-group Test262, standalone floor, and Wasm validation are
      net-non-negative.

## Risks and mitigations

- **Source-order regression:** current queues partition statics from statements.
  Use immutable source ordinals and an order verifier; do not infer order from
  registration timing.
- **TDZ/export ABI drift:** moving state allocation can shift globals or expose
  aliases too early. Plan canonical binding slots in R1 and test early/late
  reads plus throwing initialization.
- **Initialization transaction leak:** preparation or lowering may mutate
  compiler state before terminal policy. Seal intents and emit into an isolated
  transaction that publishes only after verification.
- **Double invocation:** Wasm start, deferred export, WASI guards, and `_start`
  currently live in different phases. Represent one invocation policy and
  assert exactly one semantic call per configuration.
- **Accidental R5 coupling:** current `compileMulti` accumulates and replaces
  same-name init exports. Keep R4 acceptance single-source and retain an
  explicit multi-source no-regression test until R5 owns aggregation.

## Out of scope

- Whole-program multi-source/M0 ordering, cross-file imports, cycles, or
  duplicate `__module_init` aggregation (R5).
- Replacing runtime/builtin implementations with semantic IR intrinsics (R6).
- Async/top-level-await ownership or the final unsupported-source policy (R7).
- Shared linear consumption (R8), escape-hatch removal/default flip (R9), or
  direct-handler deletion (#3090/R10).
- Treating #3517's last measured initializer or #3142's narrow claim population
  as proof that this structural issue is already complete.

The PR report must include the ordered plan dump, terminal outcome, direct/IR
emission counts, support-unit counts, startup invocation count for every mode,
and before/after proof that no legacy slot was created or patched for a
Prepared module. A green numeric initializer with no statics, TDZ, aliases, or
startup-mode matrix does not close R4.
