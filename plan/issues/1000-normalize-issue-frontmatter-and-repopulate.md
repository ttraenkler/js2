# #1000 -- Normalize issue frontmatter and repopulate historical sprint issue assignments

## Problem

Historical sprint views in the dashboard are currently inconsistent:

- many issue files were missing canonical frontmatter fields like `status` and `sprint`
- closed sprint files often still referenced carry-over work that was later moved back to backlog or into later sprints
- several older sprints (notably 4-12, 16, 19, 20, 23-25) do not render meaningful Kanban data because the dashboard cannot reliably infer which issues were actually completed in those sprints

This is now a planning-data integrity problem, not a compiler problem.

## What to do

1. Audit all issue files under `plan/issues/{ready,done,backlog,blocked}`
2. Ensure every issue has canonical frontmatter including at least:
   - `title`
   - `status`
   - `sprint`
3. Normalize sprint assignment rules:
   - current open work stays in the active sprint or backlog
   - completed work is tied to the sprint where it actually landed
4. Reconcile historical sprint docs against issue placement:
   - closed sprints should not surface later carry-over issues as ready/in-progress
   - historical done columns should show issues that actually completed in that sprint
5. Update `plan/log/issues-log.md` where issues are still missing completion rows
6. Design and, if feasible, begin migrating toward a more machine-readable issue layout:
   - instead of global `ready/`, `done/`, `blocked/`, `backlog/` buckets only
   - store issues under sprint-scoped status folders such as `plan/issues/sprint-39/done/893.md`
   - keep backlog or non-sprint work in explicit non-sprint buckets where needed
   - document migration rules and compatibility expectations for existing tools
7. Regenerate dashboard data and verify historical Kanban views for closed sprints

## Acceptance criteria

- every issue file has `status` and `sprint` in frontmatter
- `done/log.md` covers the completed issues needed for historical sprint reconstruction
- closed sprint Kanban views no longer show unrelated current ready/backlog issues
- historical sprints with known completed work (including 4-12, 16, 19, 20, 23-25) render non-empty done columns where data exists
- Sprint 40 and backlog remain the source of truth for open work
- the migration path toward sprint-scoped issue folders is documented so tooling can stop inferring sprint membership heuristically from content alone

## Notes

This issue is intentionally about planning-data correctness and dashboard reconstruction, not about changing compiler behavior.

The longer-term direction is to make sprint and status machine-readable from the
filesystem layout itself, for example:

```text
plan/issues/sprint-39/done/893.md
plan/issues/sprint-40/ready/1000.md
plan/issues/backlog/671.md
```

That should reduce the amount of fragile inference currently required from:

- sprint markdown prose
- `done/log.md`
- mixed historical issue references inside retrospective text
