# #1152 — Array.prototype higher-order methods regression from PR #195

## Problem

After PR #195 ("fix(#1026): use `__get_builtin`+`__extern_get` for built-in constructor .prototype access", merged 2026-04-19) tests that call `Array.prototype.{every,reduce,some,map,forEach,filter}` via `.call()` on array-like receivers fail with `L41:3 object is not a function` at Wasm validation/run time.

## Cluster snapshot (current main, baseline 22450 → 21324)

| Method | Still failing |
|--------|---------------|
| every | 59 |
| reduce | 62 |
| some | 45 |
| map | 55 |
| forEach | 51 |
| filter | 61 |
| **Total** | **~333** (bigger than initial 207 — drift since PR #195 merge) |

All share the same error: `object is not a function` (283x at L41:3, 101x at L55:3 — test262 harness preamble lines for `assert` / `assert.sameValue`).

## Representative failing test

```js
// test/built-ins/Array/prototype/every/15.4.4.16-3-15.js
var obj = { 0: 12, 1: 11, 2: 9, length: "2E0" };
assert(Array.prototype.every.call(obj, callbackfn1), '…');
```

The receiver is an array-like (`{ length, [0], [1], ... }`). Per ES spec §22.1.3.5 every/filter/forEach/map/reduce/some accept any `O` with integer-indexed properties.

## Root cause hypothesis

PR #195 changed built-in constructor `.prototype` access to go through `__get_builtin(name)` → `__extern_get(proto, "methodName")`. That path produces an **externref** at the Wasm level. Calling `.call(thisArg, …)` on an externref then tries a Wasm `call_ref` — but externref isn't a funcref, so the Wasm runtime (or our runtime.ts glue) surfaces `"object is not a function"`.

Before PR #195, `Array.prototype.every` was resolved statically to a compile-time function table entry (funcref), which `.call()` could invoke directly. PR #195 broke this static binding for all `BuiltinCtor.prototype.method` chains.

### Why issue #1140 didn't cover this

#1140 fixed `.call()` with array-like receivers for Array methods, but operated on the **pre-#195** assumption that `Array.prototype.method` resolves to a compile-time function. After #195 the chain is dynamic (externref), so #1140's call-site wiring no longer applies.

## Acceptance criteria

1. All 333 Array.prototype higher-order method regressions re-pass, **without** reverting PR #195 (the net +441 improvements from #195 must be preserved).
2. `assert(Array.prototype.every.call(arrayLike, fn))` works for:
   - `.every`, `.filter`, `.forEach`, `.map`, `.reduce`, `.reduceRight`, `.some`, `.find`, `.findIndex`
3. No regressions in other buckets (esp. String.prototype which shares the same `__get_builtin` path).
4. `npm test -- tests/equivalence.test.ts` passes.

## Investigation plan

1. **Reproduce locally**: compile one failing test, inspect emitted Wasm for the `Array.prototype.every.call(obj, fn)` expression.
   ```
   npx tsx .tmp/probe-1152.ts
   ```
   where the probe is the sample code above.
2. **Identify the codegen site**: grep for `__get_builtin` usage in `src/codegen/property-access.ts` and `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`. The call path for `member.call(thisArg, ...args)` on a `__get_builtin`-resolved member needs to:
   - detect that the member is a known Array prototype method
   - dispatch to the existing `array-methods.ts` implementation (which handles array-like receivers per #1140)
   - fall back to `.call` host import only for truly dynamic cases
3. **Likely fix location**: `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` — the `compileCallExpression` path for `PropertyAccess.call(...)`. Add a fast-path that detects `BuiltinCtor.prototype.methodName` *before* lowering to `__extern_get`, and route to `array-methods.ts::compileArrayMethodCall` (or equivalent) when the method is a known Array.prototype higher-order method.
4. **Spec ref**: §22.1.3.5 (Array.prototype.every), §22.1.3.7 (filter), §22.1.3.10 (forEach), §22.1.3.19 (map), §22.1.3.24 (reduce), §22.1.3.26 (some).

## Related

- PR #195 (#1026) — the change that introduced the regression
- PR #237 — earlier partial recovery
- #1140 — array-like receiver support (pre-#195)
- #1147 — companion cascade cluster from PR #177 (_start export)
- #1150 — async destructuring cluster (also from the April 19 cascade)

## Don't

- **Don't revert PR #195.** The +1,080 improvements it produced (prototype chain access for non-Array builtins) are worth more than the 333 regressions here.
- **Don't add a `__extern_call` host import** as the fix — that would work but defeats the "compile-away JS semantics" principle (#1094). Resolve statically in codegen first.
