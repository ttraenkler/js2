# #177 -- Bug: Spread operator in new expressions

## Status: in-review
## Summary
new Ctor(...args) with spread operator fails at runtime. The spread elements are not correctly expanded into constructor arguments.

## Implementation Notes
Added spread argument handling to local class constructor calls in compileNewExpression:
- Uses flattenCallArgs to resolve literal array spreads at compile time
- Falls back to compileSpreadCallArgs for non-literal spreads
- Also pads missing constructor arguments with defaults

## Complexity
M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] new Ctor(...[1,2,3]) passes correct arguments
- [x] Equivalence tests pass
