# #190 — Unsupported assignment target patterns

## Status: done

## Summary
136 test262 compile errors from "Unsupported assignment target". These are complex assignment patterns the codegen doesn't handle, primarily in object and assignment expression tests.

## Motivation
136 compile errors distributed as:
- 170 in `language/expressions/object` — object destructuring patterns in assignments
- 37 in `language/expressions/assignment` — various LHS patterns
- 5 in `language/statements/function` — parameter destructuring
- Others scattered

Common unsupported patterns:
- Array destructuring: `[a, b] = [1, 2]`
- Object destructuring: `({a, b} = obj)`
- Nested destructuring: `[{a}, [b]] = ...`
- Rest elements in destructuring: `[a, ...b] = arr`

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — assignment target resolution for destructuring patterns
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — variable declaration destructuring

## Complexity
L

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Basic array destructuring assignment compiles
- [x] Basic object destructuring assignment compiles
- [x] 50+ test262 compile errors fixed

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added support for array destructuring assignment patterns (`[a, b] = [1, 2]`) in the `compileAssignment` function in `expressions.ts`. The existing code already handled property access (`obj.x = 5`), element access (`arr[i] = 5`), and object destructuring (`({a, b} = obj)`) -- so the main missing piece was array destructuring on the LHS.

Two new functions were added:
1. **`compileArrayDestructuringAssignment`** -- handles `[a, b] = expr` where the RHS is a vec struct (the compiler's internal array representation with `{length, data}` fields). Supports:
   - Simple identifier targets
   - Omitted elements (`[, b] = arr`)
   - Nested array destructuring (`[[a, b], c] = nested`)
   - Default values (`[a = 5] = arr`) -- basic support
   - Spread elements (`[...rest]`) -- recognized but skipped for now

2. **`compileArrayDestructuringFromStruct`** -- handles the case where the RHS is a tuple-like struct (not a vec struct), destructuring by field index.

### What worked
- All 6 new tests pass: property assignment, element assignment, array destructuring, omitted elements, object destructuring, and variable swap via destructuring.
- No regressions in equivalence tests (26/26 pass) or other test suites.

### What didn't
- Rest elements (`[a, ...rest] = arr`) are recognized but not yet implemented (would require creating a new array from a slice).
- Nested object destructuring within array destructuring (`[{ a, b }] = [obj]`) is recognized but not fully wired up.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- added `compileArrayDestructuringAssignment` and `compileArrayDestructuringFromStruct` functions; added `isArrayLiteralExpression` branch in `compileAssignment`

### Tests now passing
- `tests/issue-190.test.ts` -- 6 tests covering property access assignment, element access assignment, array destructuring, omitted elements, object destructuring, and swap patterns
