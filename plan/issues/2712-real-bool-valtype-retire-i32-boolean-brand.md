# #2712 — Real bool ValType; retire the optional i32 boolean brand

**Source:** 2026-06-26 audit. Recurring "bug factory" #2: representation
collision. `{kind:"i32"}` simultaneously means **number**, **boolean**, and
**char-code**. Booleanness is carried as an *optional* side-channel brand
(`{kind:"i32", boolean:true}`, `src/checker/type-mapper.ts`) that **every boxing
site must remember to consult** — and several don't.

## Problem

#1788 (done) added `__box_boolean` and the brand for the dynamic-getter path, but
the brand is dropped at multiple boxing sites, so a boolean reifies as the
*number* 1/0:

- `Object.values`/`Object.entries` box a boolean field as `1`/`0`
  (`object-ops.ts:4000-4003`, `:4059-4063`) → `Object.values({a:true})[0]===true`
  is false; `typeof` is `"number"`.
- Map/Set key coercion boxes boolean keys as numbers (`map-runtime.ts:1204-1212`);
  `__same_value_zero` has no boolean arm → `new Set([true]).has(1)` wrongly true.
- `__to_property_key` has no boolean arm (`object-runtime.ts:459-502`) → `o[true]`
  keys `"1"` not `"true"`; a null/undefined computed key hits a non-null
  `ref.cast $AnyString` and **traps**.
- `coerceType` i32→externref drops the brand (`type-coercion.ts:1525-1537`) even
  though the adjacent i64→externref arm honours the analogous `bigint` brand.

Any *new* i32→externref site is a latent boolean-as-number bug. The brand is the
wrong shape: optionality means correctness depends on memory, not on types.

## Recommendation

Promote boolean to a **first-class ValType** (`{kind:"bool"}`), the way `bigint`
already has a typed i64 lane. Then:

- boxing dispatches on the ValType (`bool` → `__box_boolean`) — unrepresentable to
  "forget the brand";
- `__same_value_zero`, `__to_property_key`, `Object.values/entries`,
  `coerceType`, and the descriptor reify path each gain a `bool` arm by
  construction (the type forces the switch to be exhaustive);
- the i32 lane reverts to meaning *number/char-code* only.

This is value-rep substrate work — coordinate with #1917 (single coercion engine)
and the #2580 substrate spine so the bool lane lands once, centrally.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A `bool` ValType exists; the checker emits it where it currently emits
      `{kind:"i32", boolean:true}`.
- [ ] All boxing/coercion/property-key/SameValueZero sites dispatch on `bool`;
      the optional `boolean:true` brand is removed.
- [ ] `Object.values({a:true})[0]===true`, `new Set([true]).has(1)===false`,
      `o[true]` keys `"true"`, `o[null]` keys `"null"` (no trap) — all in both
      host and standalone modes.
- [ ] Equivalence + test262 non-regressing; full-CI / merge_group (broad impact).

## Senior dev note (Esch, 2026-06-27) — VERIFY-FIRST verdict: architect-gated

VERIFY-FIRST done on `origin/main` `f515906`. **Verdict: this is NOT a clean
senior slice — it is an architect-class ValType-registration decision, the exact
boolean analog of #2044** (BigInt i64-brand ValType), which the project has
already gated on an architect decision and marked `status: blocked`. #2712 is
therefore set `status: blocked`, `blocked_on` the same architect gate. No code was
changed. The analysis below is the implementation-note (the WHY) for whoever
specs/implements it next.

### Root cause — the brand is leaky *by design*, not by oversight

The issue frames the bug as "boxing sites *forget* to consult the brand." The
deeper truth found by tracing: **the brand is usually ABSENT at the boxing site
for the exact values that fail**, so there is nothing to consult.

`mapTsTypeToWasm` (`src/checker/type-mapper.ts:50-57`) only attaches
`{kind:"i32", boolean:true}` for a TS type that *is* `boolean`/`BooleanLiteral` —
i.e. **declared** boolean storage (struct fields, params, returns, annotated
locals). But **computed** booleans are produced as **bare `{kind:"i32"}` with no
brand**:

- boolean literals — `src/codegen/literals.ts:1142` (`TrueKeyword`→1,
  `FalseKeyword`→0) return bare i32;
- every comparison / equality / predicate op — e.g. `src/codegen/binary-ops.ts`
  `return { kind: "i32" }` at :300, :303, :313, :318, :394, :398, :419, :428,
  :436, :441 …;
- logical / `!` results likewise.

So `o[true as any]` and `new Set([true])` push a **brandless** i32 into the
boxing path. `coerceType` i32→externref (`src/codegen/type-coercion.ts:1525-1537`)
then `__box_number`s it to the *number* `1` — and no brand-consulting patch can
fix that, because the brand was never set. (Contrast the adjacent i64→externref
arm at `:1538-1552`, which honours `from.bigint` — but bigint shares the i64 lane
that numbers do NOT use, while boolean shares i32 with number/char-code, the
"representation collision" this issue names.)

**Consequence:** the robust fix REQUIRES typing boolean *values* (literals,
predicates, logical results) as a first-class lane, not just declared storage.
That is precisely the `{kind:"bool"}` promotion the Recommendation asks for — and
it is structurally disruptive, see below.

### Blast radius — why a separate `bool` kind is architect-scale

- **524 `=== "i32"` sites across 49 source files.** The brand was deliberately
  made **structurally inert** (#1788): every `.kind === "i32"` check still matches
  a branded boolean, so boolean locals/arithmetic/branch/`local.alloc` codegen is
  unchanged. A *separate* `{kind:"bool"}` kind inverts that guarantee — each of
  those 524 sites must be audited to also accept `bool` for i32-style storage,
  branching, and arithmetic, or boolean codegen breaks. This is the reason the
  inert brand exists.
- **Type-identity ripple (auto-park-prone).** `src/emit/canonical-recgroup.ts:132`
  already canonicalizes a boolean-branded i32 field as token `i32b`, *distinct*
  from `i32`. So booleanness already participates in struct type identity: two
  structs differing only in bool-vs-number get different type indices though they
  encode byte-identically. Widening which values are bool-typed shifts struct
  type-index assignment → validation/index churn that only surfaces in
  `merge_group` (broad value-rep ⇒ validate on the full floor, never a scoped
  sweep). Cf. memory `project_type_index_shift_and_deadelim` /
  `reference_subview_type_idx_stability`.
- **Emit seam.** `src/emit/binary.ts` (`encodeValType`, switch at :40/:623/:698)
  has no `bool` arm; a `{kind:"bool"}` must encode as the i32 byte `0x7F` there
  (Wasm has no bool valtype). One-line, but it is a required seam.

### Re-grounding (the issue is partly stale on current main)

Tested in **host mode** on `f515906` (`__box_boolean` host path):

| Case | issue claim | current main (host) |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `Object.values({a:true})[0]===true` | false (boxes 1) | **already true** ✓ (getter-extract honours brand) |
| `typeof Object.values({a:true})[0]` | `"number"` | **already `"boolean"`** ✓ |
| `o[null]` computed key | **traps** | **no trap**, keys `"null"` ✓ |
| `new Set([true]).has(1)` | wrongly true | **still wrongly true** ✗ (repro) |
| `o[true]` key | `"1"` | **still `"1"`** ✗ (repro) |

Both remaining repros share the single brandless-literal root cause above. The
issue's Problem list should be re-grounded against this table; the
`Object.values`/`typeof`/`o[null]` items are already fixed in host mode
(standalone mode is where the `$Object` dynamic reader gaps remain — see memory
`project_standalone_any_string_value_read_substrate`, and they coordinate with the
in-flight #2580/#2660 spine).

### Why NOT a quick brand-patch sub-slice

A tempting incremental sub-slice (brand boolean literals + predicate results, then
honour the brand in `coerceType`) was considered and **declined**: it is itself a
broad value-rep change (it widens what flows as `i32b` → the canonical-recgroup
type-identity ripple above → auto-park-prone), it is partially redundant with the
eventual `{kind:"bool"}` (same boxing-decision logic, different discriminant), and
it would collide with the in-flight #2580/#2660 substrate spine. The Recommendation
is right that the bool lane must land **once, centrally** with #1917 + the #2580
spine — a throwaway partial is not worth the merge-queue risk.

---

## Architect hand-off — ValType-registration problem statement

**Decision required (mirror #2044's i64-bigint decision):** should booleanness be
a first-class ValType lane `{kind:"bool"}` (storage = i32 at the emit seam), or
stay a TS-type-driven boxing decision threaded at coercion sites? Recommended:
the `bool` lane, because the brand is unreachable on computed booleans (see Root
cause) — but the registration cost is real and must be sequenced with #1917 /
#2580.

**If `{kind:"bool"}` is chosen, the spec must cover:**

1. **Union + emit seam.** Add `{ kind: "bool" }` to `ValType`
   (`src/ir/types.ts:146-160`). Add a `bool` arm to `encodeValType`
   (`src/emit/binary.ts`) emitting the i32 byte `0x7F`. Add a `bool` token to
   `canonical-recgroup.ts:122` `valTypeToken` — decide deliberately whether `bool`
   canonicalizes as today's `i32b` (preserve current struct identities → fewer
   type-index shifts) or its own token.
2. **Producers (where `bool` is born).** `mapTsTypeToWasm` boolean arm →
   `{kind:"bool"}`; boolean literals (`literals.ts:1142`); all comparison /
   equality / predicate / logical / `!` results in `binary-ops.ts` and
   `expressions/unary.ts`, `expressions/logical-ops.ts`. This is the part that
   actually fixes `o[true]` / `Set([true])`.
3. **Consumers — the 524 `=== "i32"` audit.** Produce the audit plan: which sites
   must treat `bool` *exactly* as i32 (arithmetic, branch conditions, `local`
   alloc/get/set, `select`, `i32.eqz`, switch lowering, IR `from-ast`/`lower`/
   `verify`/`propagate`, linear backend `codegen-linear/*`) vs. which must
   *dispatch* on `bool` (the boxing/coercion matrix). Recommended mechanics: a
   single `isI32Like(t)` helper (`t.kind==="i32" || t.kind==="bool"`) applied at
   the storage/arithmetic/branch sites, so the audit is a mechanical sweep rather
   than 524 bespoke edits; reserve true `=== "bool"` dispatch for the boxing seam.
4. **Boxing / coercion dispatch (the payoff — exhaustive by construction).**
   `coerceType` i32→externref (`type-coercion.ts:1525`) and the #1917 engine
   (`coercion-engine.ts:138`, already brand-aware) → `bool` ⇒ `__box_boolean`;
   `__same_value_zero` (`any-helpers.ts:377+`) gains a bool arm
   (fixes `Set([true]).has(1)`); `__to_property_key`
   (`object-runtime.ts:433-513`, standalone) + the host `__extern_*` path gain a
   bool arm (fixes `o[true]`→`"true"`); `Object.values/entries` + descriptor
   reify (`object-ops.ts:4120/4232/4305/4337/4385/4400`) dispatch on `bool`;
   then **delete the `boolean?: true` brand** from the `i32` arm and let `tsc`
   enumerate every remaining positional read.
5. **Sequencing.** Land with / behind #1917 (single coercion engine) and the
   in-flight #2580/#2660 substrate spine so the lane lands once. Validate on the
   **full merge_group floor** (host + standalone), not a scoped sweep — broad
   value-rep + type-identity ripple is auto-park-prone.

**Acceptance (unchanged from above), both host and standalone:**
`Object.values({a:true})[0]===true`, `new Set([true]).has(1)===false`, `o[true]`
keys `"true"`, `o[null]` keys `"null"` (no trap); equivalence + test262
non-regressing on full CI.

**Sequencing cross-link (architect, esch 2026-06-27):** #2732(b) — strict-equality
between a primitive boolean and a number returning the wrong answer (`true === 1`
should be `false`; verified `false === 0` evaluates EQ on current main) — is
downstream of this same boolean-as-i32 representation collision and is
**unrepresentable to fix cleanly until the `bool` lane exists**. Sequence #2732(b)
behind #2712; #2732(a) (unary `+/-/~/>>>` ToPrimitive trap) is independent and
ships on its own.

## Architect Decision (2026-07-03, fable) — NO `{kind:"bool"}`; ratify the brand, make it TOTAL at producers

**Decision: do NOT introduce a first-class `{kind:"bool"}` ValType. The inert
`{kind:"i32", boolean?: true}` brand is the permanent boolean representation.
The fix for this issue is (I1) making the brand total at every boolean
producer and (I2) routing all boxing through the single coercion choke
point — not a lattice change.** This is decided as a coherent pair with
#2044 (same date): the ValType lattice's uniform mechanism for JS types on
scalar Wasm carriers is the optional, structurally-inert brand —
`i64.bigint` (#1644), `i32.boolean` (#1788/#2795), `i32.symbol` (#2785).
Boolean does not get a divergent mechanism.

### Re-grounding 2026-07-03 (probes on current main — the issue is largely stale)

The Senior dev note's f515906 repro table has moved again. Verified via the
equivalence harness (host mode):

| Case | senior note (06-27) | current main (07-03) |
|---|---|---|
| `o[true]` computed key | keys `"1"` ✗ | **keys `"true"`** ✓ (fixed by #2795 literal branding) |
| `new Set([true]).has(1)` | wrongly `true` ✗ | **`false`** ✓ |
| `typeof (x: any = 1 < 2)` | — | `"boolean"` ✓ |
| computed predicate as key: `k: any = (n<2); o[k]` | — | keys `"true"` ✓ |
| **computed predicate into Set: `new Set([(n<2)]).has(1)`** | — | **wrongly `true` ✗ — the live repro** |

So the surviving bug class is exactly the senior note's structural diagnosis:
**comparison/logical/predicate results are still born brandless**
(`src/codegen/binary-ops.ts` has ~96 bare `return { kind: "i32" }` sites; only
literals and declared storage brand today), and any *generic* boxing path a
brandless predicate flows through (Set/Map element coercion here) reifies it
as the number 1/0. That is a **producer gap**, fixable inside the brand
design — it does not require the lattice inversion.

### Why `{kind:"bool"}` is declined (the hand-off's recommendation, considered seriously)

1. **Wasm has no bool valtype.** `{kind:"bool"}` would be a front-end fiction
   re-encoded to the i32 byte `0x7F` at the emit seam. Its only real benefit
   is compile-time switch exhaustiveness — bought at the cost of the senior
   note's own blast-radius finding: a 524-site `=== "i32"` audit, an
   `isI32Like` helper smeared across storage/branch/arithmetic sites, and
   canonical-recgroup type-identity churn that is auto-park-prone.
2. **The brand already participates everywhere it semantically must:** struct
   identity (`canonical-recgroup.ts` `i32b` token), boxing
   (`type-coercion.ts:1776` → `__box_boolean`), the #1917 engine
   (brand-aware), typeof. Promotion adds no new semantic capability.
3. **Coherence with #2044.** The bigint brand shipped, works, and is ratified.
   Two different mechanisms for the same class of problem is itself a bug
   factory; the exhaustiveness gap is compensated architecturally (I2).
4. **Migration asymmetry.** Producer-totalization is a mechanical sweep of a
   small file cluster; the bool kind is a cross-cutting inversion that
   collides with the in-flight #1917/#2580/#2660 substrate work.

### The ratified design — three invariants

- **(I1) Brand-total at production.** Every expression producing a JS boolean
  returns `{kind:"i32", boolean: true}`: literals (done, #2795), declared
  storage (done, `type-mapper.ts:56`), **comparison/equality/relational
  results, logical `!` and boolean-typed `&&`/`||` results, `in` /
  `instanceof` / `delete` results** (the open sweep — concretely the ~96 bare
  `{kind:"i32"}` returns in `src/codegen/binary-ops.ts` plus the predicate
  returns in `expressions/unary.ts` / `expressions/logical-ops.ts`). This is
  what fixes the live Set repro and is the enabling substrate for #2732(b)
  (`true === 1` must be false).
- **(I2) Consult only at the coercion choke point.** Box/unbox decisions are
  legal ONLY in `coerceType` + the #1917 coercion engine (both already
  brand-aware). The implementation converts straggler paths that hand-roll
  `__box_number` on i32 values (Map/Set key coercion `map-runtime.ts`, any
  remaining brandless `__same_value_zero` / `__to_property_key` standalone
  arms) to route through the engine rather than adding per-site brand checks.
- **(I3) Brands stay structurally inert.** Every `.kind === "i32"` check
  continues to match branded booleans; arithmetic/branch/local codegen is
  byte-unchanged; **no new canonical-recgroup token** — keep the existing
  `i32b` tokenization exactly as-is to preserve current struct identities.

### Risk note (type-identity ripple) and validation gate

I1 widens which *values* are branded, not which *declared field types* are
(field types come from `mapTsTypeToWasm`, already branded). The residual
risk is inferred struct-field types seeded from predicate initializers
shifting `i32`→`i32b` tokens → type-index churn. Per the senior note:
validate on the **full merge_group floor (host + standalone)**, never a
scoped sweep.

### Re-scoped acceptance criteria (supersedes the checklist above)

- [ ] Brand-totality: comparison/logical/unary/`in`/`instanceof` results carry
      `boolean: true` (spot-audit via the probe set below).
- [ ] `new Set<any>([(n<2) as any]).has(1) === false` and `.has(true) === true`
      (the live repro), plus the original behavioral set — `o[true]` keys
      `"true"`, `o[null]` keys `"null"`, `Object.values({a:true})[0] === true` —
      in **both** host and standalone modes.
- [ ] No boxing site outside `coerceType`/the #1917 engine decides
      number-vs-boolean for an i32 (stragglers converted, not patched).
- [ ] The `boolean?: true` brand is NOT removed (that line of the original AC
      is superseded); no `{kind:"bool"}` is introduced.
- [ ] Equivalence + test262 non-regressing on full CI / merge_group.

Sequencing unchanged: land with/behind #1917 so I2 is enforced once;
coordinate with the #2580/#2660 spine; #2732(b) stays sequenced behind this.
