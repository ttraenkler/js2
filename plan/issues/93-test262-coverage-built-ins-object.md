# Issue 93: Test262 coverage — built-ins/Object

## Status: DONE

## Summary

Added `built-ins/Object/keys`, `built-ins/Object/values`, `built-ins/Object/entries` to the test262 runner.

## Results

Most Object tests are skipped due to unsupported features (prototype chain, Object.defineProperty, getter/setter, property introspection). Object.keys/values/entries result array construction has a compiler limitation (array.new_fixed) that needs future work.

## Tests

6773 test262 tests total, 412 pass, 0 fail
