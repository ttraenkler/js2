# Issue 23: Bitwise operators

## Status: done

## Summary
Support bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`, `~`) and their compound assignment forms.

## Motivation
Bitwise ops are common in systems code, hashing, flags, and color manipulation. The IR already defines `i32.and` and `i32.or` but they are not wired into expression codegen. This is a quick win.

## Design

### Type handling
TypeScript bitwise operators work on numbers (f64) but produce 32-bit integer results. The codegen must:
1. Truncate f64 operands to i32 (`i32.trunc_f64_s`)
2. Apply the i32 operation
3. Convert the result back to f64 (`f64.convert_i32_s`), except for `>>>` which needs `f64.convert_i32_u`

### Operator mapping
| TS | Wasm |
|----|------|
| `&` | `i32.and` |
| `\|` | `i32.or` |
| `^` | `i32.xor` |
| `<<` | `i32.shl` |
| `>>` | `i32.shr_s` |
| `>>>` | `i32.shr_u` |
| `~x` | `i32.xor(x, -1)` |

### Compound assignments
`&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`, `>>>=` follow the same pattern as existing `+=`.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — add cases to binary and unary expression handling
- `src/ir/types.ts` — verify `i32.xor`, `i32.shl`, `i32.shr_s`, `i32.shr_u` exist (add if missing)
- `src/emit/binary.ts` — verify opcodes are emitted
- `src/emit/wat.ts` — verify WAT formatting
- Tests: new `tests/bitwise.test.ts`

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- `(5 & 3) === 1`, `(5 | 3) === 7`, `(5 ^ 3) === 6`
- `(1 << 3) === 8`, `(8 >> 2) === 2`
- `(~0) === -1`
- Compound assignments work: `let x = 7; x &= 3; // x === 3`
