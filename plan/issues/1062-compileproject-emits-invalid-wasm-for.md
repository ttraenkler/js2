# #1062 — Codegen bug in lodash-es/clamp.js path: `if[0] expected type i32, found call of type externref`

## Problem

Compiling `node_modules/lodash-es/clamp.js` via `compileProject({ allowJs: true })` succeeds at the TS/codegen level but produces a Wasm binary that fails validation:

```
WebAssembly.compile(): Compiling function #23:"toNumber" failed:
  if[0] expected type i32, found call of type externref @+3664
```

`toNumber` in lodash-es is a non-trivial function: it branches on `typeof value`, uses `isObject(value) && (other = typeof other.valueOf === 'function') ? ...`, inspects `NaN`, parses strings. Somewhere in the lowering an `if` condition ends up typed as `externref` when the surrounding block expects `i32`.

Surfaced by #1031. The fact that the compiler accepts the source, runs codegen, and emits a binary that only fails at WebAssembly.compile time suggests the bug is in a coercion/merge point in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` or `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` rather than in the TS analyzer.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A minimal reproducer is extracted from lodash-es/clamp.js and added to `tests/issue-1062.test.ts`.
- [ ] The reproducer compiles to a Wasm module that validates and runs correctly.
- [ ] The existing `#1031 ... lodash-es/clamp.js: Wasm validation fails on generated toNumber` assertion in `tests/stress/lodash-tier1.test.ts` flips — the test should be rewritten to assert success and `clamp(5, 0, 10) === 5`.

## Notes

- Likely an interaction between `typeof` branching, `isObject(value)` (which returns boolean from `extern.convert_any`-ed externrefs), and the if-expression merge in the type-coercion pass.
- Start by extracting a minimal reproducer from lodash-es/toNumber.js (the failing function), then bisect the branches.
- Blocked by #1060 + #1061 only in the end-to-end sense; the reproducer is a standalone file and can be worked in parallel.
