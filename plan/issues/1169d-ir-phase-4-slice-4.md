# #1169d — IR Phase 4 Slice 4: class instantiation and method calls through IR

## Goal

Extend the IR selector (`src/ir/select.ts`) and IR lowering (`src/ir/from-ast.ts`,
`src/ir/lower.ts`) so functions that use typed class instances are claimed by the
IR path instead of falling through to legacy codegen.

This is Slice 5 from the #1169 migration roadmap ("Classes — `this`, method
dispatch, prototype chain").

## Scope

Start narrow — only claim functions where:

1. The class itself is declared in the same file with typed fields and methods
2. All constructor params and method return types are primitive-typed (f64, bool)
   OR a known local class type
3. The body only uses: `new Cls(...)`, `obj.method(...)`, `obj.field`,
   `obj.field = ...`, `this.field`, `this.method(...)`, and the existing
   Phase-1 expression set

Do NOT attempt to claim functions that involve:
- Inheritance / `extends` (defer to a later slice)
- `super` calls (defer)
- Static methods (defer)
- Dynamic property access (string-keyed, `obj[key]`)
- Prototype mutation

## Key files

- `src/ir/select.ts` — `isPhase1Expr`, `isPhase1TypeNode` (add class-type recognition)
- `src/ir/from-ast.ts` — AST→IR lowering (add `NewExpression`, `PropertyAccessExpression`,
  `CallExpression` with method callee)
- `src/ir/lower.ts` — IR→Wasm lowering (add struct allocation, field get/set, method dispatch)
- `src/ir/types.ts` — IR type definitions (add class/struct lattice type if needed)

## Acceptance criteria

1. At least one test in `tests/equivalence/` exercises a simple class (constructor +
   method) and the IR selector claims that function (verified by inspecting selection output)
2. Equivalence tests pass with no regressions
3. A new equivalence test in `tests/equivalence/` covers:
   - class with typed fields, constructor, and one method
   - method calling another method on `this`
   - instance passed as argument to a function
4. No test262 regressions (CI passes)
5. `src/ir/select.ts` comments document what class shapes are accepted in slice 4

## Implementation notes

- Check how the existing struct type in WasmGC is emitted for classes in
  `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts` — the IR lowering should reuse or mirror the
  same struct layout
- The IR lattice type (`LatticeType` in `src/ir/propagate.ts`) may need a
  `"class"` variant or a struct-reference variant to propagate class types
  through the selector
- Use the pattern from slices 1–3: add a shape-check gate in `isPhase1Expr`,
  add a lowering case in `from-ast.ts`, add a Wasm emission case in `lower.ts`
- Keep the call-graph closure invariant: if a method is IR-claimed, all its
  callees in the same file must also be IR-claimed or fall through correctly
