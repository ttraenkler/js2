# #1204 — Methodology document

## Problem

js2wasm is built differently from any other open-source compiler: the implementation
team is a coordinated system of AI agents (Claude Code), with a human project lead
(Thomas Tränkler) acting as tech lead and product owner rather than writing code.

This is not a gimmick. It is a reproducible methodology with a documented process,
version-controlled agent definitions, sprint histories, and a growing body of evidence
(25,000+ test262 passes, 70+ merged PRs, 45 sprints). The methodology has been
independently evolved by iterating on what works — agent coordination protocols,
worktree isolation, self-merge criteria, token budget management, issue file conventions.

Currently, none of this is visible to an outside reader. A senior engineer who clones
the repo sees code, tests, and CI — but not the process that produced them, or the
evidence that the process is sound. This limits both credibility and community growth.

## Implementation plan

Write `docs/methodology.md` — a 15–25 page document covering the following sections.
The audience is: senior engineers who are skeptical but curious.

### Section 1 — Motivation (1–2 pages)

Why build a compiler this way?
- Compilers are a canonical "hard AI task" — rich domain knowledge, tight correctness
  constraints, measurable output. Good evaluation ground for AI-assisted development.
- The human-time leverage point: one person can direct a team of 8 agents in parallel,
  doing work that would require a 4–6 person engineering team.
- The openness angle: all agent definitions, sprint plans, issue files, and retrospectives
  are committed. The methodology is the product, not just the compiler.

### Section 2 — Pipeline architecture (2–3 pages)

How the compilation pipeline was designed and built:
- TypeScript source → IR → WasmGC binary
- IR design: SSA-ish, typed, wasm-close but still readable
- The dual-mode architecture (JS-hosted vs standalone)
- How the IR was incrementally introduced (slices 1–10) without breaking existing code
- Concrete code examples: what a compiled function looks like at the IR level, then as Wasm

### Section 3 — Agent team structure (3–4 pages)

How the team works:
- Roles: Product Owner, Architect, Tech Lead (human), Developer ×8, Scrum Master
- Communication protocol: SendMessage for blockers/decisions, TaskUpdate for status
- Worktree isolation: why each agent works in a separate git worktree
- Issue file as the contract: problem statement → implementation spec → acceptance criteria
- Sprint lifecycle: planning → dispatch → implement → self-merge → retro

Include the team diagram from `plan/method/team-setup.md` (ASCII, not image).

### Section 4 — Correctness anchors (2–3 pages)

How we know the output is correct:
- test262 conformance: 43K tests, 59.8% pass rate (current), with categorical breakdown
  (link to dashboard from #1201)
- Equivalence test suite: 500+ hand-written tests exercising specific compiler paths
- Differential testing: comparison vs V8 on 1000+ programs (from #1203)
- CI gates: every PR gated on regression ratio <10%, no bucket >50 regressions
- Baseline drift detection: how we distinguish real regressions from CI measurement noise

### Section 5 — Decision boundaries (2–3 pages)

What the agents are allowed to decide vs what the human decides:
- Agents decide: implementation approach within the spec'd issue, test structure,
  code organisation within their worktree
- Human decides: sprint priorities, architecture changes, ADR-level decisions (see #1202),
  merge conflicts in `src/**`, any change to `.github/workflows/` or `.claude/`
- The safety model: CODEOWNERS, branch protection, `check-cwd.sh` hook preventing
  commits from non-worktree paths

### Section 6 — Failure modes and how we handle them (2–3 pages)

What can go wrong and what we do:
- Agent inbox failures (all 3 agents in sprint 45 had broken message delivery — state
  captured in tech-lead.md instead)
- Token budget exhaustion — stop at 75%, defer to next sprint
- Regression crises — forced baseline refresh, snapshot_delta as secondary signal
- Architecture drift — ADRs and `check-cwd.sh` as guardrails
- Merge conflicts — escalate to senior-developer (Opus) agent
- Agent produces wrong answer — CI catches it; issue filed for next sprint

### Section 7 — Comparison with traditional development (1–2 pages)

Honest comparison:
- Throughput: 3–4 issues per agent per day, 8 agents = ~25 issues/day ceiling
  (versus 1–2 issues/day for a skilled human engineer on a complex compiler)
- Quality: test-driven by construction; agents follow specs and checklists consistently
- Architectural coherence: lower than a single-author project (the IR slice story
  shows how shortcuts accumulate); mitigated by the refactor-issue pattern
- Context limits: agents don't retain cross-session memory (mitigated by issue files
  as the shared context, handoff documents, and ADRs)
- Cost: at current API pricing, one sprint ≈ $X in API spend (calculate from token logs)

### Section 8 — How to contribute (1–2 pages)

For both human and AI contributors:
- **Human**: standard PR flow — clone, branch, implement, test, PR. Issues in `plan/issues/ready/`
  are ready to pick up.
- **AI agent**: clone the repo, install Claude Code, spawn a `developer` agent pointed at
  a `plan/issues/ready/*.md` issue file. The agent reads the issue, creates a worktree,
  implements the spec, opens a PR.
- Required: Node.js 22+, pnpm, wasmtime 44+
- Recommended: read one ADR and one sprint retrospective before writing code

### Section 9 — Open questions (1 page)

Honest unresolved questions:
- Can the methodology scale to projects with more architectural ambiguity?
- What is the right human:agent ratio for a production codebase?
- How do we handle agent disagreement on approach (currently: human decides)?
- When is the methodology not appropriate (highly exploratory R&D, user research, etc.)?

## Acceptance criteria

1. `docs/methodology.md` exists and is ≥ 3,000 words.
2. All 9 sections are present and non-trivial (each ≥ 200 words).
3. The document cites concrete data: sprint count, test262 pass rate, PR count, issue count.
4. The document is accurate — no contradictions with `plan/method/team-setup.md` or
   the sprint histories.
5. `README.md` links to `docs/methodology.md` under a "How this is built" section.
6. The document passes a basic credibility bar: a senior engineer reading it would
   not find obvious errors or marketing language — it is factual and honest about tradeoffs.

## Out of scope

- A blog post or announcement (separate; may excerpt from this document).
- Video walkthrough.
- Translation.
- Benchmarking the methodology itself (how many agent-hours per PR? — deferred).

## Risk

The main risk is writing a document that overpromises. The methodology is real and works;
but it has known failure modes (Section 6). An accurate document that acknowledges failure
modes is more credible than a promotional one that doesn't.

Write this document only after #1201 (dashboard) and #1202 (ADRs) are in place — both
are referenced from the methodology document and should exist before the doc is published.

## Notes

The `plan/` directory in the repo already contains all the raw material: sprint plans,
retrospectives, issue files, agent context files. The methodology document is a synthesis
of that material for an external audience. It should not contradict any of it — if it
does, the plan/ directory wins (it is the primary source).

The document's existence is itself a credibility signal: it shows the methodology was
designed and iterated consciously, not accidentally arrived at.
