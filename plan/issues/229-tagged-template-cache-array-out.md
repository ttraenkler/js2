# Issue #229: Tagged template cache: array out of bounds on top-level repeated calls

## Status: done

## Summary

Tagged template cache globals could reference wrong Wasm globals when `addStringConstantGlobal` was called during codegen (e.g. from `emitBoolToString` or function `.name` access), shifting import global indices and invalidating previously-emitted `global.get`/`global.set` instructions.

## Root Cause

When `addStringConstantGlobal` is called during codegen, it adds a new import global which increments `numImportGlobals`. This shifts the absolute indices of all module-defined globals (tagged template caches, top-level variable globals, init guard globals). Previously-emitted `global.get`/`global.set` instructions contained stale absolute indices, causing them to reference the wrong global -- either an immutable import global (causing "immutable global cannot be assigned" errors) or a global of the wrong type.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] No array out of bounds on top-level tagged template calls
- [x] Template objects are reference-identical across calls to the same site
- [x] Late string constant imports (bool-to-string, function .name) don't break global indices

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added `fixupModuleGlobalIndices` helper that walks all instruction arrays (including nested if/else/block/loop bodies) and shifts `global.get`/`global.set` indices >= a threshold by a delta
- Modified `addStringConstantGlobal` to immediately call fixup when a new import global is inserted during codegen (when compiled functions or module globals already exist)
- The fixup covers: already-compiled function bodies, current function being compiled (`ctx.currentFunc.body`), and global init expressions

### What worked
- Immediate fixup at point of import addition correctly handles all cases, including when multiple import globals are added during a single function's compilation

### What didn't work
- Post-compilation fixup pass (record initial numImportGlobals, compute delta at end) failed because instructions emitted AFTER the import addition already had correct indices and would be double-shifted

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts`: Added `fixupModuleGlobalIndices`, modified `addStringConstantGlobal`
- `tests/issue-229.test.ts`: 7 new tests

### Tests now passing
- 7 new tests, 3 existing tagged template equivalence tests, no regressions

## Complexity: S
