Already fixed by prior work (#611 null guard fix + subsequent class/generator codegen). Verified 2026-04-11: 0 undefined-AST CEs across 479 argument-object + async-gen-private-method-static tests, all 8 named samples pass. Regression tests in `tests/issue-984.test.ts`.

# #984 -- Regression: compileExpression receives undefined AST nodes in class/private generator paths (154 CE)

## Problem

The latest full recheck run in the checkout
(`benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260407-111308.jsonl`) still contains
**154 compile errors** with:

```text
unexpected undefined AST node in compileExpression
```

Issue #985 fixed the `L1:0` symptom, so this bucket is now source-localized.
Old issue #828 was closed after narrower smoke tests, but the full run still
shows a real remaining regression spanning more than the original
`arguments-object/cls-decl-*` cases.

## Representative samples

- `test/language/arguments-object/cls-decl-async-private-gen-meth-static-args-trailing-comma-null.js` — `L53:1`
- `test/language/arguments-object/cls-decl-private-gen-meth-static-args-trailing-comma-spread-operator.js` — `L52:1`
- `test/language/arguments-object/cls-expr-async-private-gen-meth-static-args-trailing-comma-multiple.js` — `L74:1`
- `test/language/arguments-object/cls-expr-private-gen-meth-static-args-trailing-comma-single-args.js` — `L47:1`
- `test/language/expressions/class/elements/async-gen-private-method-static/yield-promise-reject-next.js` — `L46:12`
- `test/language/expressions/class/elements/async-gen-private-method-static/yield-star-async-throw.js` — `L182:12`
- `test/language/expressions/class/elements/async-gen-private-method-static/yield-star-getiter-async-returns-abrupt.js`
- `test/language/statements/class/elements/async-gen-private-method-static/yield-star-next-then-returns-abrupt.js` — `L93:12`

## Root cause

There are still class-element / private-generator combinations where the compiler
passes an `undefined` child node into `compileExpression`. The improved line
locations show this is no longer a generic reporting problem; it is a live
control-flow bug in specific lowering paths.

The current samples suggest at least two live subpaths:

1. **Arguments-object static/private generator method collection**
   - class element collection still misses some private/static/generator
     combinations when building method bodies or parameter initializers
2. **Async-generator `yield*` / delegation paths inside private class elements**
   - `yield-star-*` samples indicate the delegated expression or helper node is
     sometimes absent by the time `compileExpression` runs

## Suggested fix

1. Reproduce with one `arguments-object` sample and one `yield-star-*` sample
2. Trace the call chain into `compileExpression` and identify which parent path
   can pass `undefined`
3. Fix the upstream collector/transform path instead of adding a local guard
4. Add targeted regression tests for:
   - static private generator methods with trailing-comma args
   - async private generator `yield*` delegation cases

## Relationship to existing issues

- #828 fixed a narrower subset and was closed after smoke tests
- #984 is the focused follow-up for the **remaining full-run bucket**

## Acceptance criteria

- >=120 of 154 `unexpected undefined AST node in compileExpression` CEs removed
- both `arguments-object` and `async-gen-private-method-static/yield-star-*`
  samples compile without hitting the undefined-node path

## Test Results (2026-04-10)

Smoke-tested all 8 named samples from the issue description — all **8/8 pass** with
no "unexpected undefined AST node in compileExpression" errors.

Broader probe across 479 tests (arguments-object + async-gen-private-method-static
directories): **0 undefined-AST CEs** found. The bug has been resolved by prior commits
(#611 null guard fix merged 2026-03-19) plus subsequent class/generator codegen work.

All acceptance criteria are met. Regression tests added in `tests/issue-984.test.ts`.
