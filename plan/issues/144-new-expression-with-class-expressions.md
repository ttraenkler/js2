# Issue #144: new expression with class expressions

## Status: DONE

## Problem
`new` with function expressions failed because `compileNewExpression` could not resolve
the constructor when `expr.expression` was a `FunctionExpression` rather than an identifier.
The code fell through to the "Unknown constructor" path which produced `ref.null.extern`
without ever calling the function body.

Affected patterns:
- `new function() { ... }()` — basic function expression constructor
- `new function() { ... }(...[args])` — with spread arguments
- `new function() { ... }(a, b, ...[c, d])` — mixed args with spread

## Root Cause
`compileNewExpression` tried to resolve a class name from the expression's type symbol,
but `new function() { ... }()` has type `any` with no symbol. It fell through to the
`__new_<name>` import path which produced a null externref without executing the body.

## Fix
Added `compileNewFunctionExpression()` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` that:

1. Detects `ts.isFunctionExpression(expr.expression)` at the top of `compileNewExpression`
2. Flattens spread arguments at compile time (expanding `...[a,b,c]` into individual args)
3. Creates a lifted function with a closure struct for captured variables
4. Sets up the `arguments` object inside the lifted function from the call-site params
5. Compiles the function body with proper capture initialization
6. At the call site, builds the closure struct and calls the lifted function directly

Also added helper `flattenCallArgs()` to resolve spread on array literals into individual
expressions, and `usesArguments()` to detect `arguments` usage in function bodies.

## Test Results
- 4 tests fixed: `spread-mult-empty`, `spread-mult-literal`, `spread-sngl-empty`, `spread-sngl-literal`
- All 72 equivalence tests pass (no regressions)
- 2 tests remain compile_error (`spread-*-expr.js`) due to non-literal spread (`...arr` variable)
- 2 tests remain compile_error (`ctorExpr-*`) due to `this` property access in constructors

## Files Changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — added `compileNewFunctionExpression()`, `flattenCallArgs()`, `usesArguments()`
