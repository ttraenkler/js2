# #194 — Logical assignment operators compile errors

## Status: in-review
## Summary
40 test262 compile errors in `language/expressions/logical-assignment` (`&&=`, `||=`, `??=`). While 11 tests pass, 40 fail to compile due to type flexibility and class declaration issues.

## Motivation
40 compile errors breakdown:
- 27 "type not assignable" — LHS and RHS have incompatible types
- 15 "Unsupported call expression" — call expressions in assignment context
- 21 "Unsupported statement: ClassDeclaration" — class declarations in test body
- 1 wasm validation error

Many of these overlap with broader issues (#145 type flexibility, #150 ClassDeclaration), but the logical assignment operator itself may need better type handling for the short-circuit assignment pattern.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — logical assignment operator codegen

## Complexity
M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `x &&= newValue` works with different types on LHS/RHS
- [ ] 10+ test262 logical-assignment compile errors fixed (remaining failures are due to ClassDeclaration #150 and type flexibility #145, not the operator codegen itself)

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
The core logical assignment operator codegen (`&&=`, `||=`, `??=`) was already fully implemented in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` via `compileLogicalAssignment`, `compilePropertyLogicalAssignment`, `compileElementLogicalAssignment`, and `emitLogicalAssignmentPattern`. The implementation correctly handles:

- Simple identifier targets (locals, globals, captured variables)
- Property access targets (`obj.prop &&= val`)
- Element access targets (`arr[i] ||= val`)
- Short-circuit semantics (RHS only evaluated when needed)
- Value-preserving semantics (result of expression is the final value)
- f64 short-circuit for `??=` (numbers can never be null)
- Both expression and statement contexts

Added comprehensive test coverage in `tests/issue-194.test.ts` (19 tests) covering:
- All three operators with truthy/falsy values
- Property access and element access targets
- Function parameters and module globals
- Expression result usage (in arithmetic, assignment)
- Function call on RHS (short-circuit evaluation)
- NaN edge case
- Chained logical assignments

### What worked
All 19 new tests pass. All 11 existing `tests/logical-assignment.test.ts` tests continue to pass. No regressions in equivalence tests.

### What didn't
The remaining 40 test262 compile errors are not caused by the logical assignment operator codegen itself, but by:
- ClassDeclaration support (issue #150)
- Type flexibility / union types (issue #145)
- Unsupported call expressions in certain contexts

These are separate issues with their own tracking.

### Files changed
- `tests/issue-194.test.ts` (new) -- 19 tests for logical assignment operators

### Tests now passing
- All 19 tests in `tests/issue-194.test.ts`
- All 11 tests in `tests/logical-assignment.test.ts` (pre-existing, still pass)
