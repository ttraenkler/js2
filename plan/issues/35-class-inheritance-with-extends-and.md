# Issue #35: Class inheritance with extends and super

## Summary

Add support for class inheritance using `extends` and `super` keywords,
enabling subclassing with field inheritance, constructor chaining, method
override, and `super.method()` calls.

## Motivation

Classes are already supported but only as flat structs without any hierarchy.
Real-world TypeScript makes heavy use of inheritance:

```ts
class Animal {
  name: string;
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  speak(): number {
    return 0;
  }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
  constructor(name: string, breed: string) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }
  speak(): number {
    return 1;
  }
}
```

## Design

### Wasm GC sub-typing

Child struct types declare a sub-type relationship:

```wat
(type $Animal (sub (struct (field $name externref))))
(type $Dog (sub $Animal (struct (field $name externref) (field $breed externref))))
```

The child struct **must** include all parent fields first, followed by its own fields.

### Implementation steps

1. **StructTypeDef** — add optional `superTypeIdx?: number` field
2. **collectClassDeclaration** — detect `extends` via `heritageClauses`, look up
   parent struct in `structMap`, prepend parent fields to child fields, set
   `superTypeIdx`
3. **Parent types must be non-final** — emit parent structs wrapped in `sub`
   (non-final) so children can extend them
4. **Constructor chaining** — `super(args)` in child constructor executes parent
   field initialisation logic inline; the child `struct.new` creates all fields
5. **Method override** — child's `speak()` registered as `Dog_speak`; parent's
   as `Animal_speak`. Static dispatch picks the right one based on declared type.
6. **Method inheritance** — if child doesn't override a method, calls route to
   `ParentClass_method`
7. **super.method()** — explicitly calls `ParentClass_method` with `this`
8. **Binary emitter** — `sub` encoding: `0x50`, supertype count, supertype idx,
   then struct definition
9. **WAT emitter** — `(type $Dog (sub $Animal (struct ...)))`

### Scope

- Single inheritance only (no mixins, no interfaces)
- Static dispatch (no vtable / dynamic dispatch)
- `super()` must appear in child constructor
- `super.method()` calls supported in method bodies

## Test plan

- Basic extends: child accesses parent fields
- Constructor chaining: super(args) initialises parent fields
- Method override: child overrides parent method
- Method inheritance: child calls inherited method
- super.method(): explicit parent method call
- Multi-level inheritance: grandchild extends child
- Mixed field types: parent and child have different field types

## Complexity

L — touches codegen, binary emitter, WAT emitter, IR types
