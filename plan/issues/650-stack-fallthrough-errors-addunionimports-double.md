# Stack fallthrough errors — addUnionImports double-shift

## Problem

Test262 tests `bigint-and-number.js` (addition and subtraction) fail with Wasm validation errors like:
- "expected 0 elements on the stack for fallthru, found 2"
- "function index 21 out of bounds (7 entries)"

The existing `bigint-cross-type.test.ts` third test case ("closure triggering addUnionImports does not corrupt parent body") was also failing.

## Root Cause

In `addUnionImports` (`src/codegen/index.ts`), function index shifting was tracked in two separate Sets:

1. `shifted` (line 7188) — used for `mod.functions`, `currentFunc`, `funcStack`, and `savedBodies`
2. `done` (line 7230) — used for `parentBodiesStack`, initialized only from `mod.functions` and `currentFunc`

The problem: `parentBodiesStack[i]` and `funcStack[i].body` are the **same array reference** (both pushed from `savedFunc` during closure compilation). The `done` Set did not include bodies already shifted by the `funcStack` loop, so the same body array was shifted twice — doubling the delta and producing out-of-bounds function indices.

## Fix

Use the unified `shifted` Set for the `parentBodiesStack` loop instead of creating a separate `done` Set. This ensures each body array is shifted exactly once.

## Implementation Summary

- **What was done**: Replaced the separate `done` Set block with a simple loop using the existing `shifted` Set
- **Files changed**: `src/codegen/index.ts` (removed 12 lines, added 7 lines)
- **Tests added**: `tests/stack-fallthrough.test.ts` — 3 test cases covering the double-shift scenario
- **Tests now passing**: `bigint-cross-type.test.ts` third test case, plus 2 test262 bigint-and-number.js tests
