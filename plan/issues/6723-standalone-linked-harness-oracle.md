## Problem

Since the #3451 slice 6 flip (2026-09-17) the js-host test262 lane compiles
the harness prefix once per include-set and links each test body against it.
The standalone lane still compiles the whole assembly (harness + body) for
every row. The gate is one condition in `tests/test262-shared.ts`
(`TEST262_ORACLE_MODE === "linked" && IS_HOST_LANE`).

Cost today, from the promoted standalone baseline (2026-09-24, 48,735 rows)
and six merge_group runs (2026-09-28, see #6722):

| | js-host (linked) | standalone (honest) |
|---|---:|---:|
| `Run shard` runner-seconds per merge_group | ~8.5k | ~39.7k |
| compile per row, median | ~0.25 s | 2.25 s |
| compile, whole corpus | — | 38.8 core-h |
| of which Temporal rows (4,603) | — | 8.45 core-h |

#6722 rebalances the matrix (20/82) so the lanes finish together, but the
standalone lane is still ~82 % of all test262 work in every merge group.

The original reason for host-only was that the provider "crosses its values
through the JS host bridge, which a standalone/WASI binary does not have"
(`tests/test262-shared.ts` comment). That reason is stale: the harness
provider rides the same package linker as the Temporal provider, and #5383
built a host-free standalone Temporal provider whose consumers link with zero
host imports (`result.imports === []`, measured 2026-09-12). The machinery
exists; three defects stop it on standalone.

## Measurement (2026-09-28, this plan's evidence)

Local A/B on a seeded random sample of 360 non-Temporal, non-intl402
standalone rows (`random.seed(6723)` over the baseline jsonl), same bundles,
fresh harness cache per run, `COMPILER_POOL_SIZE=3`,
`TEST262_TARGET=standalone TEST262_ORACLE_MODE=linked`. Arm A: current gate
(honest). Arm B: `IS_HOST_LANE` removed from the gate (file-copy swap of
`tests/test262-shared.ts`, restored after). Result files:
`benchmarks/results/salinked-{honest,linked}-results-*.jsonl` (local only).

| | honest | linked (gate removed) |
|---|---:|---:|
| wall | 481 s | 751 s |
| pass / fail / CE / timeout | 300 / 43 / 17 / 0 | 285 / 54 / 17 / 4 |
| rows actually linked | — | 15 (345 fell back) |

Only one include-set family built a provider (`testTypedArray.js` ±
`compareArray` / `propertyHelper` / `detachArrayBuffer`). On its 11 linked
rows that did not hit the fork budget, body compile fell from **94.3 s to
22.1 s (4.3×)**. The other four linked rows hit the 30 s fork budget because
the cold provider build was charged to them. Small sample, one family — the
speed figure is a direction, not a forecast.

Three defects, each reproduced:

**D1 — the default include-set cannot build a standalone provider.** 17 of
the provider builds failed with
`Harness provider was not linked separately (plan=bundled, reason=test262-harness provider requires unsupported import js2wasm:runtime-eval)`.
The default prefix (`__js2wasm_test262_runtime__.js` + `assert.js` +
`sta.js`, 10.2 KB) compiled alone for standalone reports `imports: []`, so the
eval import is one the row path satisfies at instantiation
(`scripts/test262-import-object.mjs` → `instantiateTest262Module`) and the
compile's import list deliberately hides. The package linker's provider check
(`src/package-linker.ts` ~L1934, `allowedProviderModules`) reads the RAW
Wasm imports and admits only `env`, `wasm:js-string`, the string-constant
namespaces, `options.link` and dependency bindings. `js2wasm:runtime-eval`
is none of those, so the provider falls back to a bundled plan and
`buildHarnessProvider` throws.

**D2 — linked standalone bodies cannot see harness bindings.** Every linked
TypedArray row that passes honest failed linked, 9 of 10, with
`ReferenceError: testWithTypedArrayConstructors is not defined`,
`verifyProperty is not defined`, `TypedArray is not defined`. The body's
binding prelude (`var <name> = __h_<name>()`, `harnessBindingPrelude` in
`src/test262-harness-provider.ts`) either does not reach the standalone
global resolution the body uses, or the getter returns before the provider's
`__module_init` has run on standalone. Repro:
`test/built-ins/TypedArray/prototype/findIndex/name.js`.

**D3 — standalone fallback rows lose strict mode.** Four rows that fell back
(`linked-harness-fallback`) flipped pass→fail with
`Expected a TypeError to be thrown but no exception was thrown at all`:
`language/expressions/compound-assignment/11.13.2-23-s.js`,
`built-ins/Function/15.3.5.4_2-21gs.js`,
`language/arguments-object/10.5-1-s.js`,
`language/function-code/10.4.3-1-9gs.js`. The fallback compiles
`linkedHarness.harnessPrefix + source` (`scripts/test262-worker.mjs`
~L1665), not the honest assembly; on standalone the strict variant loses its
directive position. The host lane does **not** show this: 359 of 360 strict
host fallback rows pass in the promoted baseline, so it is standalone-only.

Side finding, host lane: 9,280 of 48,735 promoted host rows (19 %) are
`linked-harness-fallback`, 4,611 of them Temporal (the worker compiles
Temporal rows honestly by design, L1598), the rest mostly linked compile
failures on syntax the body-only unit rejects
(`Expression expected`, `Rest element may not have a default initializer`,
`A rest element must be last`, `Invalid left-hand side`, ~280 each). Those
are cost on host too, and the same classes will appear on standalone.

## Implementation Plan

Mirrors the #3451 slice 6 host flip. Opus implements; each phase is its own
PR, measured before the next.

### P0 — make the linked lane correct on standalone (no CI change)

1. **D1, provider imports.** In `src/package-linker.ts`, admit
   `js2wasm:runtime-eval` in `allowedProviderModules` when the provider is
   compiled for `target: "standalone"`. Then make the provider instance
   receive the same runtime-eval binding the row gets: the harness provider is
   instantiated by `instantiateLinkedProviders` (runtime bundle); it must be
   handed the per-test runtime-eval provider from
   `scripts/test262-import-object.mjs`, the one seam that already owns tier
   selection. Check first whether the prefix needs the import at all: if the
   eval import is emitted unconditionally, compiling the provider with the
   #6676 option (`false`: no runtime-eval provider will be linked) may remove
   it, which is the smaller fix. Measure both on the default prefix before
   choosing.
   - Unit test: `buildHarnessProvider` for the default prefix with
     `target: "standalone"` returns a provider (no throw), and a consumer
     compiled with `compileHarnessLinkedBody` reports `imports: []`.
2. **D2, bindings.** Reproduce on `TypedArray/prototype/findIndex/name.js`
   linked. Establish whether the getter import resolves (inspect the
   consumer's WAT for the `__h_` imports and the prelude's `global.set`s), and
   whether standalone's undeclared-global lookup reads the script-goal `var`
   the prelude declares. The host path works; diff the host and standalone
   consumer WAT for the same body first. Unit test: a linked standalone body
   calling `verifyProperty` and `testWithTypedArrayConstructors` passes.
3. **D3, fallback strictness.** The fallback must compile exactly what the
   honest lane compiles. Replace `linkedHarness.harnessPrefix + source` with
   the honest assembly for the variant being run (the worker already has it:
   the row's original assembled source). Host keeps working (its fallback
   rows already pass) and standalone stops flipping. Unit test: one of the
   four rows above, fallback forced, keeps its strict verdict.
4. **Re-measure** the same 360-row sample (the seed and procedure above).
   Target: zero verdict diffs attributable to D1–D3, and every
   non-Temporal include-set in the sample building a provider.

### P1 — the 30 s fork budget: prewarm standalone harness providers

A cold provider build is charged to the first row of its include-set and
kills rows at 30 s (4 of 15 in the measurement).
`scripts/prewarm-test262-harness-providers.mjs` already accepts
`--target standalone`. Add a prewarm step to the standalone shard job (or a
single upstream job that uploads the cache as the Temporal provider does,
`temporal-provider` job ~L860), keyed on the compiler bundle hash. Note the
harness provider cache key currently has no compiler hash (see
`JS2WASM_TEST262_HARNESS_CACHE` handling), so a stale cache is a real hazard
in CI too; add the bundle hash to the key in the same PR.

### P2 — shadow measurement in CI

Dispatch-only run with the standalone cells in linked mode (a
`standalone_linked` workflow input, default off), parity report via
`scripts/test262-linked-parity.mjs` against the promoted standalone baseline.
Record in this issue: per-row compile, `Run shard` totals, pass→fail and
fail→pass counts, fallback-reason histogram. Gate to proceed: pass→fail ≤ the
host flip's rate (705 of ~40k before P0 there, 353 declared at flip), no
`illegal cast` / trap bucket (the #3189 trap ratchet is not excused by a
re-baseline), and a median standalone shard at least 2× faster.

### P3 — authority flip (the host slice 6 recipe, standalone cells)

1. `tests/test262-shared.ts`: drop `&& IS_HOST_LANE` from the linked arm
   only (the `fast` arm stays host-only; the native harness genuinely needs a
   JS host).
2. `tests/test262-oracle-version.ts`: `ORACLE_VERSION` 14 → 15, history note
   "standalone verdicts come from the linked-harness oracle"; this forward
   bump makes `diff-test262.ts` auto-rebase the first main run and
   promote-baseline re-seed `test262-standalone-current.jsonl` with
   `oracle_lane: linked-harness`.
3. Declare the measured P2 ceiling in this issue's frontmatter
   (`regressions-allow`, rebase mode, #3303), hand-edit the standalone
   edition-ratchet floors by exactly the measured per-edition delta with a
   `reason`, and re-seed the standalone high-water mark
   (`benchmarks/results/test262-standalone-highwater.json`) the same way the
   host flip documented.
4. Standalone honest audit: extend `test262-honest-audit` with standalone
   cells (nightly cron, never required), and point the parity report at them.
5. `scripts/gen-test262-mg-matrix.mjs`: re-derive the split from the first
   three green merge_group runs after the flip (procedure in that file).
6. CLAUDE.md "Test262" and `docs/ci-policy.md`: the linked oracle is
   authoritative for both lanes; honest is the audit for both.

### P4 — Temporal rows (separate issue when P3 lands)

Temporal rows are 8.45 of 38.8 standalone core-hours and compile honestly on
both lanes (`scripts/test262-worker.mjs` L1598). Linking the harness provider
and the Temporal provider into the same consumer depends on #5407's per-site
link cost. File it once P3's numbers show what is left.

## Acceptance

- [ ] P0: the 360-row sample shows no D1–D3 verdict diffs, and every
      non-Temporal include-set in it builds a standalone provider.
- [ ] P1: no `compile_timeout` row caused by a cold harness provider build in
      a standalone shard.
- [ ] P2: dispatch parity report recorded here, meeting the P2 gate.
- [ ] P3: merge_group standalone median shard ≥ 2× faster than the #6722
      baseline, first post-flip runs recorded, matrix re-derived.

## Expected gain (estimate, to be replaced by P2's measurement)

If P0 lifts the linked share on standalone to the host lane's 81 % and the
4.3× body speed-up holds beyond one include-set, the non-Temporal 30.4
core-hours drop to ~11.7, and the lane to ~20 core-hours with Temporal
unchanged: about 1.9× less standalone work per merge group. The P2
measurement decides whether P3 goes ahead.

## P0 results (2026-09-28)

Sample: the same 360 files as the Measurement section (taken verbatim from
the lead's `salinked-honest` result file; re-deriving `random.seed(6723)`
from today's re-promoted baseline gives a different sample, 3/360 overlap).
Same procedure: fresh harness cache per run, `COMPILER_POOL_SIZE=3`, quickjs
eval engine, 4-core box. Linked arm = `&& IS_HOST_LANE` removed from the
gate by file copy, never committed. Result files (local only):
`benchmarks/results/p0{new-sa-honest,base-sa-linked,b-sa-linked,base-host-linked,final-host-linked}-results-*.jsonl`.

### What each defect actually was

| | root cause | fix |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | `$262` is exported by the provider, so the runtime shim's `evalScript` direct eval stays live and the provider imports `js2wasm:runtime-eval` (the prefix compiled ALONE reports none only because `$262` is dead code there). `runtimeEvalProvider: false` does not remove it (measured: same refusal) and would change eval verdicts anyway. On this box EVERY include-set failed (359/360 rows "no harness provider"), not just the default one. | `src/package-linker.ts`: admit `js2wasm:runtime-eval` for `target: standalone` providers (not under `runtimeEvalProvider: false`). `scripts/test262-import-object.mjs`: attach the row's ONE runtime-eval instance when the consumer OR any linked provider imports it; the provider inherits it (non-env namespaces pass through `buildProviderImportObject`). |
| D2 | Not a binding bug. The compile-timeout and poison RETRIES in `tests/test262-shared.ts` re-sent the linked body-only unit without `linkedHarnessOpts`, so the retried row compiled the body with no harness. Every D2 row in the lead's file carries `retried: true`; the first attempts were cold-provider timeouts. Affects the host lane too (any timed-out linked row). | Spread `...linkedHarnessOpts` into both retry calls. |
| D3 | As diagnosed: `prefix + bodySource` puts the strict directive after the harness. | The parent sends `linkedHarnessHonestSource` (the honest assembly of the variant being run, primary or strict rerun); the worker's fallback and the Temporal branch compile it. Error-line offset switches to the honest one on fallback rows. |

Also (worker, standalone-only): exception payloads minted by the provider
(`Test262Error` from `assert.*`) are rendered through the provider's own
`__exn_render_*` exports, and the async drain runs every linked module's
microtask ring. Verdict-neutral except where the message decides a
runtime-negative match; it is what made the table below readable.

### Standalone, 360 rows

| arm | pass | fail | CE | timeout | rows linked | compile ms (all rows) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| honest (`p0new-sa-honest`) | 313 | 31 | 16 | 0 | — | 1,034,969 |
| linked, main (`p0base-sa-linked`) | 309 | 35 | 16 | 0 | 1 | 1,506,951 |
| linked, P0 (`p0b-sa-linked`) | 193 | 153 | 14 | 0 | 305 | 646,191 |

- main linked vs honest: exactly the 4 D3 rows (`11.13.2-23-s`,
  `15.3.5.4_2-21gs`, `10.5-1-s`, `10.4.3-1-9gs`), all fallback rows.
- P0: every include-set in the sample built a provider (19 distinct
  providers, 27 cold builds, max 12.3 s, 0 "no harness provider"); the 55
  fallbacks are all body-level `linked compile failed` (syntax the body-only
  unit rejects, as on host).
- Compile on the 305 linked rows: honest 1,009,551 ms vs linked 595,007 ms
  (1.7×); median per row 2,542 ms vs 1,248 ms. Standalone linked body
  compile is ~5× the host lane's ~0.25 s, so the speed-up is much smaller
  than the 4.3× measured on 11 rows.
- No cold-build timeouts in this run (P1 still applies: 12.3 s builds are
  charged to rows).

### P0 is NOT correct yet: a new defect class (D4) appears once rows link

125 verdict diffs vs honest (122 pass→fail, 2 →pass, 1 CE→fail), none attributable to D1–D3.
They are cross-module semantics on standalone — two modules, two sets of
in-wasm intrinsics, and the provider reading consumer-minted values:

| count | class | example |
|---:|---|---|
| 39 | `assert.throws`: provider reads `thrown.constructor` of a consumer-minted error → `undefined` ("Expected a TypeError but got a undefined") | `TypedArray/prototype/filter/BigInt/callbackfn-not-callable-throws.js`, `arguments-object/10.5-1-s.js` |
| 27 | provider-minted/foreign payload not renderable (`[object Object]`), same family | `TypedArray/prototype/set/array-arg-return-abrupt-from-src-get-length.js` |
| 18 | async completion marker not observed: the provider's `print` compiles to the no-sink drop (no `__stdout_*` in either module) | `class/elements/async-gen-private-method-static/yield-star-getiter-sync-returns-number-throw.js` |
| 11 | `verifyProperty` descriptor reads on consumer functions (`length`/`name`) | `Array/prototype/toString/length.js` |
| 10 | provider's TypedArray constructors/prototypes used from the body → `undefined` methods | `TypedArray/prototype/map/return-new-typedarray-from-positive-length.js` |
| 4 | iterator protocol across modules ("value is not iterable") | `for-of/dstr/array-empty-iter-close.js` |
| 13 | other pass→fail (sameValue on foreign values, `asyncTest` flag, 1 illegal cast) | |

This is the #5383 reverse-peer boundary (`src/codegen/standalone-link-reverse-peer.ts`)
not yet covering getOwnPropertyDescriptor / `constructor` / iterator / typed
array arms, plus per-module intrinsics. Options, none chosen here:

1. Extend the reverse-peer ABI arm by arm (descriptor read, error
   `constructor`, iterator step, TypedArray brand) until the sample's diffs
   clear — incremental, but each arm is its own #5383-sized slice.
2. One intrinsic realm per linked graph: the provider owns the intrinsics
   and the consumer imports them (the host lane gets this for free from the
   JS realm). Removes most classes at once; large ABI change.
3. Gate the standalone linked lane per include-set / per body shape and
   fall back otherwise — cheap, but the classes above hit the core
   `assert.throws`/`verifyProperty` helpers, so little would link.
4. Fix the provider stdout sink separately (18 rows) — a compiler defect in
   the multi-file standalone plan, independent of 1–3.

### Host lane unchanged

`p0base-host-linked` (main) vs `p0final-host-linked` (P0), same 360 rows,
`TEST262_ORACLE_MODE=linked`: 302 / 57 / 1 CE both, 316 linked / 44
fallback both, **0 verdict diffs**.

## D4 slice: provider print sink (2026-09-29)

**Root cause — not a compiler defect, a worker option.** The provider DOES mint
the `__stdout_acc`/`__stdout_append` sink (the name is in its binary), and
`print` does append to it. Its readout exports `__stdout_prepare`/`__stdout_char`
are host-bridge exports, which `stripHostBridgeExports` removes on standalone
unless the compile passes `hostBridge: "always"`. Every worker compile site gets
that through `HARNESS_HOST_BRIDGE` (`compileSingleSource`/`compileMultipleSources`),
but the linked path compiles through `buildHarnessProvider` and
`compileHarnessLinkedBody` directly, bypassing both wrappers — so neither the
provider nor the body carried the bridge the honest standalone compile has.
The marker was written; nothing could read it. (Host is unaffected: on a JS
environment `"auto"` already resolves to the same `required` interop.)

**Fix** (`scripts/test262-worker.mjs`): `...HARNESS_HOST_BRIDGE` in
`harnessProviderCompileOptions` and in the linked `bodyOptions`. The provider
owns its own sink and the worker already reads every linked module's sink
(P0's `drainAndCaptureNativeStdout`), so no ABI change and no host import
(consumer `result.imports` stays `[]`, asserted in the new test). The provider
cache key already fingerprints `hostBridge`, so stale providers cannot be reused.

Unit test `tests/issue-6723-standalone-linked-print.test.ts`: async `$DONE`
marker observed through the provider's drained sink; a synchronous `$DONE()`
(its `print` running in the provider) observed; and the repro (default
`hostBridge`: provider publishes no `__stdout_*`, marker lost).

### Measurement — same 360 rows as P0 (P0's `.tmp/sample.txt`), same procedure

Fresh harness cache per run, `COMPILER_POOL_SIZE=3`, quickjs eval, linked arm
gated on by file copy (never committed). Base = `origin/main` 075e05dfc4
(includes P0). Result files (local only):
`benchmarks/results/d4{base,new}-{sa,host}-linked-results-*.jsonl`.

| arm | pass | fail | CE | timeout | rows linked | "marker not observed" |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| standalone linked, main (`d4base-sa-linked`) | 194 | 156 | 10 | 0 | 309 | 26 |
| standalone linked, fix (`d4new-sa-linked`) | **216** | 134 | 10 | 0 | 309 | **0** |
| host linked, main (`d4base-host-linked`) | 302 | 57 | 1 | 0 | 316 | 0 |
| host linked, fix (`d4new-host-linked`) | 302 | 57 | 1 | 0 | 316 | 0 |

(main's standalone linked arm today is 194/156/10, not P0's 193/153/14 — main
moved; the comparison above is against a base run executed today.)

- Standalone: **22 fail→pass, 0 pass→fail.** 18 are the D4 print rows
  (incl. `statements/class/elements/async-gen-private-method-static/yield-star-getiter-sync-returns-number-throw.js`
  and its `expressions/` twin). The other 4 are D4 `verifyProperty` `length`
  rows (`annexB/String/prototype/{fixed,sup}/length.js`,
  `Array/prototype/toString/length.js`, `String/prototype/repeat/length.js`):
  the body now also carries the bridge the honest compile has, which the
  descriptor read relies on.
- The 8 other base rows that reported "marker not observed" now report their
  real `Test262:AsyncTestFailure` text: 3 fail linked but pass honest, all the
  D4 `assert.throws` constructor class ("Expected a ReferenceError but got a
  undefined": `async-generator/dstr/obj-ptrn-prop-id.js`,
  `class/dstr/async-private-gen-meth-static-obj-ptrn-prop-ary.js`,
  `statements/class/dstr/async-private-gen-meth-ary-ptrn-elem-obj-prop-id.js`);
  5 fail or CE honest too.
- Host: **0 verdict diffs.**

### Still open (not this slice)

- A test body calling the provider's `print` DIRECTLY (`print("x")`, a
  `var print = function …` closure value) throws "Cannot access property on
  null or undefined" on standalone, while a call to a declared provider
  function (`$DONE()`) works — cross-module closure-value call, same family as
  the other D4 classes. Rare in test262 (async rows go through `$DONE`).
- D4 classes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 unchanged.
