# #573 — struct.get on null ref in class tests (751 CE + 223 null pointer FAIL)

## Status: in-review
974 tests fail because of null struct references in class compilation:
- 751 CE: Wasm validation "struct.get expected (ref null N), found ref.null" — the compiler emits struct.get on a bare ref.null instead of a typed nullable ref
- 223 FAIL: "RuntimeError: dereferencing a null pointer" — struct.get on an actual null at runtime

**100% in class tests** (`language/statements/class`). These share a root cause: class instance references are not properly initialized or typed before field access.

Likely fix: ensure `this` in class methods is typed as `(ref null $ClassName)` not `ref.null`, and add null guards for optional/conditional construction patterns.

## Complexity: M

## Implementation Summary

### Root causes identified and fixed

Three distinct bugs were found and fixed in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`:

1. **Duplicate struct fields from shared array reference**: When dynamically adding fields to struct types, the code pushed the new field to both `fields` (from `ctx.structFields`) and `typeDef.fields` (from `ctx.mod.types`). For class structs, these are **the same array** (set up at class registration time in index.ts line 7732-7737). This caused each dynamic field to be added twice, breaking struct.new argument counts. Fix: check `typeDef.fields !== fields` before the second push.

2. **Constructor struct.new not updated after dynamic field addition**: When code like `C.prototype` or `obj.newProp` dynamically added fields to a struct type whose constructor was already compiled, the constructor's `struct.new` instruction expected fewer values than the struct now required. Fix: added `patchStructNewForDynamicField()` helper that walks all compiled function bodies and inserts default value instructions before any `struct.new` targeting the modified struct type.

3. **ClassName.prototype/constructor treated as struct field**: Accessing `C.prototype` (common in test262 class tests) would resolve `C` to its struct type and then dynamically add a `prototype` field, which is incorrect -- `prototype` is a JS metaproperty, not an instance field. Fix: added early return for `ClassName.prototype` and `ClassName.constructor` when the object is a class name (checked via `ctx.classSet`), returning `ref.null extern` (externref) as a default value.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: 3 fixes + 3 new helper functions

### Tests
- All 40 existing class tests pass (6 test files)
- 69 additional core tests pass (no regressions)
- test262 class/definition + class/subclass: 66 pass (was 32 before fix)
- Pre-existing failure in codegen.test.ts (closure capture test) is unrelated
