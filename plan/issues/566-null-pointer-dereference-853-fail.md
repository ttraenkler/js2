# Issue #566: Null pointer dereference (853 FAIL)

## Problem

853 test262 tests fail with "RuntimeError: dereferencing a null pointer" when
struct.get/struct.set is performed on null references, mostly in class
expressions/statements.

## Root cause

When a `main()` function exists, the module-level init body (which handles
`const a = new MyClass()`, method calls like `a.add(10)`, etc.) is prepended
to `main`'s body and its locals are appended to `main`'s locals.

The local indices in the init body must be shifted by the number of existing
`main` locals. The original code only shifted top-level instructions but did
NOT recurse into nested `if/then/else`, `block`, or `loop` bodies.

This meant that `local.get` instructions inside null-guard `if/else` branches
(used for method calls on `ref null` receivers) were left with stale indices,
causing them to load uninitialized (null) locals instead of the correctly
tee'd receiver.

Example of the bug (WAT before fix):
```wat
local.tee 1      ;; save receiver to local 1 (shifted correctly)
ref.is_null
(if (else
  local.get 0    ;; BUG: should be 1, but was not shifted
  ref.as_non_null
  call $method
))
```

## Fix

Replaced the flat instruction loop with a recursive `shiftLocalIndices()`
function that walks into `then`, `else`, `body`, and `instrs` arrays of
nested instructions.

## Implementation Summary

- **What was done**: Made the local index shift recursive when merging
  `__module_init` body into `main()`.
- **Files changed**: `src/codegen/index.ts` (replaced flat loop with
  recursive `shiftLocalIndices` helper)
- **Tests**: Added `tests/null-deref-class.test.ts` with 4 test cases
  covering class methods that read/write `this` properties.
