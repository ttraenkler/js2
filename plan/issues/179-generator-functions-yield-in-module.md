# #179 — Generator functions: yield in module mode errors

## Status: in-review
completed: 2026-03-13

## Summary
163 test262 compile errors related to `yield` being treated as reserved word in strict mode. Since test262 tests are wrapped in modules (always strict mode), generator functions can't use `yield` unless properly recognized as generator context.

## Motivation
163 compile errors in `language/expressions/generators` and `language/expressions/yield`:
- "Identifier expected. 'yield' is a reserved word in strict mode" (16 tests)
- "yield expression outside of generator function" (25 tests)
- Combined with other errors in generator-heavy tests

Generator support exists but the wrapping of test262 tests as modules makes TypeScript treat `yield` as invalid.

## Scope
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` — wrapTest() may need to declare generator functions differently
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — generator function detection in module context

## Complexity
M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Generator tests in test262 can use `yield` without "reserved word" errors
- [ ] 30+ test262 compile errors fixed (requires test262 corpus to verify)

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Replaced the all-or-nothing `yield` renaming logic in `wrapTest()` with a smarter `renameYieldOutsideGenerators()` function that:

1. If no `yield` in source, returns immediately (fast path)
2. If no `function*` in source, renames all `yield` to `_yield` (same as before)
3. If generators are present, scans for `function*` declarations, tracks brace depth to find their body ranges, then selectively renames `yield` only outside those ranges

The previous logic was binary: if any generator function existed, no `yield` tokens were renamed. This failed when test262 tests used `yield` as an identifier (valid in sloppy mode) alongside generator functions.

### What worked
- Brace-depth tracking correctly identifies generator body boundaries
- String literal skipping prevents false brace counting
- All 9 existing generator tests continue to pass
- New test suite with 9 test cases covers all edge cases

### Files changed
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- added `renameYieldOutsideGenerators()`, updated `wrapTest()` to use it
- `tests/issue-179.test.ts` -- 9 new tests for yield renaming behavior

### Tests now passing
- All 9 tests in `tests/issue-179.test.ts`
- All 9 tests in `tests/generators.test.ts` (no regressions)
