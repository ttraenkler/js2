# #1008 -- Add mobile-first layout support to the playground

## Problem

The playground currently assumes desktop-sized viewports. On mobile screens:

- panels remain side-by-side horizontally or stacked in ways that do not fit small screen widths or heights well
- the available editor/output space is cramped and hard to navigate
- the sidebar is always exposed in a desktop-oriented way instead of behaving like a mobile navigation surface

That makes the playground difficult to use on phones and smaller tablets.

## Goal

Make the playground usable on mobile by introducing a responsive mobile-first layout, a collapsible sidebar, and a compact navigation pattern that matches limited screen space.

## Scope

- redesign the playground panel layout for narrow viewports
- ensure editor, output, and auxiliary panels fit mobile widths/heights without awkward permanent side-by-side splits
- add a mobile burger-menu toggle for the sidebar
- make the sidebar start folded on mobile
- keep the desktop interaction model intact

## Deliverables

- responsive mobile layout behavior for the playground
- sidebar burger-menu toggle for mobile
- mobile default state with the sidebar collapsed
- sensible panel sizing/stacking behavior for phones and narrow tablets

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The playground is usable on mobile-width screens without horizontal overflow from the main panel layout
- [ ] The sidebar is hidden by default on mobile and can be opened via a burger-menu toggle
- [ ] Panel layout adapts to both narrow widths and short viewport heights
- [ ] Desktop behavior remains unchanged or equivalent
- [ ] The mobile layout still supports the core flow: edit code, inspect output, and switch views

## Notes

- This is a playground UX/layout issue, not a compiler/runtime issue.
- The mobile solution should prioritize readability and navigation simplicity over preserving the exact desktop panel arrangement.
