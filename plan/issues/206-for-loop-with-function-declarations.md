# #206 — For-loop with function declarations: 182 compile errors

## Status: backlog

## Summary
182 test262 compile errors in `language/statements/for`. This is one of the highest-error categories. Many involve for-loops containing function declarations, class declarations, or complex scoping.

## Motivation
182 compile errors in for-statements. Error breakdown:
- 30 "Unsupported call expression" — calls to functions declared in loop body
- 62 "type not assignable" — loop variable type changes across iterations
- 30 "Unsupported call expression" — complex call patterns in loop
- 5 wasm validation errors — type mismatches in loop body
- Others: scope/hoisting issues

The key unlock: for-loops that contain function declarations or closures over the loop variable.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — for-loop body codegen with declarations
- Variable scope: `let` in for-loop creates new binding per iteration

## Complexity
L

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Function declarations inside for-loops compile
- [ ] `for (let i = 0; ...)` creates per-iteration binding
- [ ] 50+ test262 for-loop compile errors fixed
