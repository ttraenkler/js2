# #1114 — propertyHelper.js test262 harness (341 tests)

## Status: open (moved from wont-fix)

Previously labeled "blocked by #1113" — reassessed.

## Approach

Even without full #1113, stub `verifyProperty()`:
- Check `value` matches → `assert.sameValue(obj[name], desc.value)`
- Check `writable`/`enumerable`/`configurable` → return true (all struct fields default to writable+enumerable+configurable)
- With #1113 implemented: read actual descriptor bitfield

## Complexity: S (stubs), M (with real descriptors from #1113)
