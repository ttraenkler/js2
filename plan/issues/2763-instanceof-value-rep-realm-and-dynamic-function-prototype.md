# #2763 — instanceof value-representation residual (cross-realm identity + dynamic-Function `.prototype`)

Architect-scoped split of the #2740 umbrella. These two clusters are NOT
instanceof-operator bugs — they are value-representation gaps that surface
through `instanceof` tests. They fold into the value-rep / IR substrate roadmap.
Verified against current `main` on 2026-06-28 (see #2740 for the full trace).

## Cluster 1 — cross-realm `Object`/`Function` constructor identity (value-rep)

`var O = Object; ({}) instanceof O` returns **false** at runtime (should be
`true`). The DIRECT `({}) instanceof Object` only passes because it is
_static-folded_ in codegen, masking the gap.

Root cause (traced in `_instanceofResult`, `src/runtime.ts`): when the RHS
constructor flows through a variable to the dynamic path
(`__instanceof_check`), the `Object`/`Function` globals arrive as a
**sandbox-realm** `function Object(){ [native code] }`, so `target === Object`
(the host-realm intrinsic) is **false**; and the `{}` LHS arrives as a _real
host object_ whose `[[Prototype]]` is host `Object.prototype`, so the native
`v instanceof target` walks a mismatched prototype chain and yields false. The
explicit WasmGC-struct Object/Function recognition (`_isWasmStruct(v)` +
`target === Object`) does not fire because (a) `v` is a real object not a wasm
struct here, and (b) the realm-split breaks the identity compare.

Affected test262 (failing on main):

- `language/expressions/instanceof/S11.8.6_A2.1_T1.js` (`var O=Object; ({}) instanceof O === true`)
- `language/expressions/instanceof/S11.8.6_A2.4_T1.js` (`var O=0; (O=Object,{}) instanceof O` — also hits the over-eager static-throw)
- `language/expressions/instanceof/S11.8.6_A2.4_T4.js` (`(O=Object,{}) instanceof O`, undeclared O)
- `language/expressions/instanceof/S11.8.6_A6_T1.js` (`({}) instanceof this`; top-level `this` is `undefined`, dynamic path returns false instead of throwing TypeError)
- `language/expressions/instanceof/S11.8.6_A6_T4.js` (plain-function `new MyFunct` + `instanceof MyFunct`/`Function`/`Object` + non-callable throw)

Note: there is ALSO an over-eager codegen static-throw — `compileHostInstanceOf`
in `src/codegen/expressions/identifiers.ts` throws `TypeError` unconditionally
when the RHS _static type_ is exclusively primitive (e.g. `var O = 0`), which is
unsound for a reassignable binding (`O = Object` at runtime). Narrowing that
static-throw to literal/keyword-primitive RHS only (routing identifiers to the
dynamic check) is the codegen half; it must land together with the realm-safe
runtime recognition or A2.4_T1 flips from a wrong-throw to a wrong-`false`.

## Cluster 2 — `.prototype` access on dynamic `Function(...)` / `new Function` values traps

`Function(...)` and `new Function` DO return real callables now (the
`src/runtime.ts` comment claiming they "lower to undefined" is **STALE** —
verified: `typeof Function("return 1") === "function"`). But reading
`.prototype` off such a value traps with the internal
`"TypeError: Cannot access property on null or undefined"` — a property-access
gap on Function-typed dynamic values, not an instanceof bug. This is the cluster
the original #2740 framing mis-labeled "null/undefined LHS": the null-deref is on
`FACTORY.prototype`, after `FACTORY = Function(...)`, not in the instanceof.

Affected test262 (failing on main, all blocked on this `.prototype` trap before
instanceof even runs):

- `S15.3.5.3_A2_T6.js` (`new Function; FACTORY.prototype="error"` → expect TypeError)
- `S15.3.5.3_A2_T2.js` (`new Function; FACTORY.prototype=undefined` → expect TypeError)
- `S15.3.5.3_A3_T1.js` (`Function("…"); FACTORY.prototype.type=1; new FACTORY`)
- `S15.3.5.3_A2_T5.js` (`Function("…"); FACTORY.prototype.name=…`)
- `S11.8.6_A7_T1.js` / `S11.8.6_A7_T3.js` (`new Function; .constructor`/`.prototype`)
- `S15.3.5.3_A3_T2.js` (`Function(); FAKEFACTORY.prototype = Object.prototype`)

## Acceptance criteria

- `var O = Object; ({}) instanceof O` → `true`; `var F = Function; (function(){}) instanceof F` → `true` (realm-safe constructor identity in the dynamic instanceof path).
- `({}) instanceof this` (this = undefined) → throws `TypeError`.
- `.prototype` read/write on a `Function(...)` / `new Function` value no longer traps.
- No regression in the 28 instanceof tests currently green.

## Notes

- Spec: ES2023 §13.10.2, §7.3.20.
- Key sites: `src/runtime.ts` `_instanceofResult` (~2215), `__instanceof_check`/`__instanceof` (~12224); `src/codegen/expressions/identifiers.ts` `compileHostInstanceOf`/`tryStaticInstanceOf`; property-access for `.prototype` on Function values in `src/codegen/property-access.ts`.
- Architect should decide whether the realm-safe Object/Function recognition belongs in the runtime (`_instanceofResult`) or is subsumed by a broader value-rep change (the harness realm-split may itself need addressing).

## Reground (2026-07-02, dev-2912f, task #22)

Re-verified against current main (baseline `46e390c`-era jsonl + direct
compile/run probes):

**Cluster 1 — partially LANDED.** The realm-safe constructor recognition has
merged: `S11.8.6_A2.1_T1` (the headline `var O = Object; ({}) instanceof O`)
now **passes**. Still failing: `A2.4_T1`, `A2.4_T4`, `A6_T1`, `A6_T4`.

**The codegen static-throw narrowing is NOT independently landable** —
implemented and probe-tested this session, then deliberately reverted:

- Mechanically correct: exempting reassignable (`var`/`let`/param/undeclared)
  identifier RHS from the #2702 static throw keeps every currently-correct
  shape correct (`var num = 100; x instanceof num` still throws — the runtime
  `_instanceofResult` throws for genuine primitive targets; literal and
  `const`-primitive RHS keep the static throw; `undefined`/`NaN`/`Infinity`
  must stay static — a dynamic `undefined` target deliberately answers
  `false`).
- But it flips ZERO tests: in `A2.4_T1` (`var OBJECT = 0;
(OBJECT = Object, {}) instanceof OBJECT`) the binding compiles to an
  f64-typed local, the function value does not survive the `OBJECT = Object`
  store, and the dynamic check receives a NUMBER → same TypeError, now from
  the runtime. **The true blocker is value-rep widening of
  primitive-initialized mutable bindings later assigned function values** —
  exactly this issue's [SUBSTRATE] scope. Land the narrowing TOGETHER WITH
  the widening, not before.
- `A2.4_T4` (undeclared `OBJECT`): already routes dynamically (type `any`);
  fails because the non-strict undeclared-global assignment/read path drops
  the value (probe: returns `false`, expected `true`) — same substrate family.
- `A6_T1` (`({}) instanceof this`, top-level `this === undefined`): dynamic
  path answers `false` by the documented conservative-undefined rule in
  `_instanceofResult`. Note the rule's justification ("`Function(...)` lowers
  to undefined") is confirmed STALE (cluster 2 header) — tightening
  undefined→TypeError on the dynamic path is plausible now but must be
  regression-swept against everything relying on the conservative `false`.
- `A6_T4`: case 2 (`instanceof Function` → false) passes; case 1
  (`new MyFunct() instanceof MyFunct` with a plain function expression)
  returns `false` — plain-function `.prototype`/proto-chain identity gap,
  distinct from the realm work.

**Cluster 2 — one incidental flip.** `S11.8.6_A7_T1` now passes;
`S15.3.5.3_A2_T2/T5/T6`, `A3_T1/T2`, `S11.8.6_A7_T3` still fail (the
`.prototype`-on-dynamic-Function trap stands).

Issue stays open, architect-scoped, with the value-rep widening as the
gating dependency for the cluster-1 residuals.

## Implementation Plan (Fable, 2026-07-18) — spec'd as a consumer of the #745/#2773 carrier ABI

### Interface assumptions (what this consumes; reference, do not fork)

- **From #745 (S2–S4 landed 2026-07-16):** the universal `$AnyValue` carrier
  + canonical `JsTag`; `isHeterogeneousPrimitiveUnion`
  (`src/checker/type-mapper.ts`) + the `resolveWasmType` union mapping
  behind `ctx.unionAnyRep` (opt-in); carrier-agnostic eq/truthiness/concat
  (S3) and params/returns/any-boundary (S4). **Assumed stable:** the
  carrier's field layout and the boxToAny jsType-hint seam. The
  default-JS-host-lane flip (S5) is HARD-GATED on #2141 — so the host-lane
  slices below use plain **externref** widening, NOT `$AnyValue`, and do
  not wait for S5.
- **From #2773:** nothing structural — the fnctor/dispatch slices (S1–S5)
  are sibling work; the only shared file risk is `property-access.ts`
  (cluster 2) — ordinary merge hygiene.
- **From #2141:** no hard gate (this issue's fixes live in the host lane
  runtime + codegen widening, not in tag classification).

### W1 (M) — assignment-set widening for mutable bindings (the cluster-1 gate)

The 07-02 reground pinned the blocker: `var OBJECT = 0; OBJECT = Object`
compiles the binding to an f64 local, so the function value cannot survive
the store. Fix at the DECLARATION-type resolution:

- **Mechanism:** for a mutable (`var`/`let`) binding whose initializer is
  primitive-typed, scan the binding's assignment set (the checker gives
  every write via the symbol; the #2690 usage-inference widening is the
  sibling precedent for params — mirror its walk, don't re-derive). If any
  assignment's static type is function/object/builtin-ctor-shaped, widen
  the local's ValType: **host lane → externref** (values are host callables
  /objects; every consumer — calls, `instanceof` dynamic path,
  property-access — already accepts externref); **standalone →
  `ref_null $AnyValue`** via extending the #745 predicate with a
  `mixedPrimitiveObjectUnion` arm (flag-gated under the SAME
  `ctx.unionAnyRep` discipline; the object member rides tag-6/refval or
  externval per the settled classifier).
- **Numeric writes into the widened binding** box via `boxToAny`/
  `__box_number` exactly as an `any` local does — this is the ordinary
  any-flow, no new machinery.
- **Land TOGETHER with the codegen static-throw narrowing** (the reverted
  probe from 07-02: exempt reassignable identifier RHS from the #2702
  static TypeError, keep it for literal/`const`-primitive/`undefined`/
  `NaN`/`Infinity`) — sequenced in one PR so `A2.4_T1` flips throw→true
  rather than throw→false.
- Also covers `A2.4_T4`: the non-strict undeclared-global write/read path
  drops the value — route undeclared-global bindings through the same
  widened representation (they are already `any`-typed; the drop is in the
  sloppy-global store path — trace and fix in this slice, it is the same
  family).

### W2 (S–M) — `.prototype` access on dynamic Function values (cluster 2)

The trap is a property-access refusal on a Function-typed dynamic value —
NOT an instanceof bug. `Function(...)`/`new Function` values are host
callables (externref); reading `.prototype` hits the null-guarded member
path. Fix: in `property-access.ts`, a member read/write whose receiver's
static type is Function (or `any` holding a callable) routes through the
dynamic `__extern_get`/`__extern_set` path instead of the trapping guard —
the host object genuinely has a `.prototype` own property, so the generic
read answers it. Write side (`FACTORY.prototype = x`) rides `__extern_set`.
The T2/T6 rows additionally assert the §10.4.3-era TypeError semantics on
`new` with a non-object prototype — that throw comes from the construct
path reading the (now-readable) `.prototype`; verify the construct lowering
consumes the dynamic read rather than a static slot.

### W3 (S) — undefined-RHS tightening (`A6_T1`)

Flip the documented conservative-`false` for an undefined dynamic RHS to
the spec TypeError (§13.10.2 step 5: RHS not an Object → throw). The
original justification ("`Function(...)` lowers to undefined") is verified
stale. Regression protocol: grep the conservative rule's other
beneficiaries in `_instanceofResult` + a host-lane A/B on the full
`language/expressions/instanceof/` directory before landing — a sweep, not
a spot check, because the rule is old enough to have accreted reliers.

### Out of scope / routing notes

- `A6_T4` case 1 (`new MyFunct() instanceof MyFunct` for a plain function
  EXPRESSION) is the plain-function `.prototype`-chain identity gap — it
  belongs to the fnctor lane (#2773 S1/S2b + #3138/#3139), not here;
  cross-reference only.
- The standalone-lane dynamic `instanceof` is #2916 (spec'd 2026-07-18);
  this issue is the HOST-lane value-rep residual. The two must not merge:
  different runtimes, different carriers.
- Order: W1 (with the narrowing) → W2 → W3; each host-lane A/B'd on the
  instanceof + Function/prototype directories; no standalone-floor exposure
  except the `unionAnyRep` predicate extension, which is flag-gated OFF.
