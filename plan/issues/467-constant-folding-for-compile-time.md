# #467 — Constant folding for compile-time evaluable expressions

Expressions like `2 + 3`, `"hello".length`, `Math.PI * 2` can be evaluated at compile time instead of emitting runtime instructions. `tryStaticToNumber` handles some cases but many constant expressions are still computed at runtime.

## Approach
- Extend `tryStaticToNumber` to handle more patterns (binary ops on constants, string.length on literals)
- When both operands of a binary expression are compile-time constants, fold to a single constant instruction
- Propagate constants through simple variable assignments (`const x = 5; x + 1` → `6`)
