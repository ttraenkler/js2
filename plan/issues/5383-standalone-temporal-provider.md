# #5383 — `Temporal` in standalone mode

## Problem

Every Temporal PR to date (#4628, #5248, #5353, #5364, #5373, #5374, #5376,
#5377, #5378, #5380, #5381) targets the JS-host lane: the compiled
`@js-temporal/polyfill` is linked as a provider built with `--target gc` plus
the JS host adapter. **The standalone target has no `Temporal` at all.** The
project owner's direction (2026-09-07) is standalone only.

Standalone baseline (`test262-standalone-current.jsonl`, 2026-09-07, sha
d4258c82), `built-ins/Temporal/**`:

| status | rows |
| --- | --- |
| pass | 170 |
| fail | 3,979 |
| compile_error | 454 |
| **total** | **4,603** |

Top reasons: `ReferenceError: Temporal is not defined` 1,506;
`standalone target emitted host imports: env::__temporal_plain_date_from_string_field`
and siblings 454 (the #661 compile-time lowering in
`src/codegen/temporal-native.ts` still emits host imports under standalone);
`called value is not a function` 361; `Cannot read properties of undefined
(reading 'since'|'until'|'toString')` 460.

### What is NOT a blocker (measured, do not re-derive)

- **The "deferred export is unavailable for WASI" note is about `--target wasi`,
  not `standalone`.** `src/package-linker.ts` L1882 already compiles every
  provider with `deferTopLevelInit: true`, and standalone honours it: a
  top-level-statement module compiled with `{ target: "standalone",
  deferTopLevelInit: true }` exports `__module_init` (probe
  `.tmp/sa-temporal/red2.mts`, 2026-09-07). The linker's
  `hasTopLevelStatements && !initExport` fallback will not fire for standalone.
- **`Intl` and `BigInt` references compile under standalone with zero `env`
  imports** (same probe: `new Intl.DateTimeFormat(...)`, `typeof Intl`,
  `BigInt(3)` all valid, `env` import set empty). Only **66 of 4,603** Temporal
  rows reference `Intl.` or `toLocaleString`, and 0 use a non-ISO calendar
  literal; those 66 stay out of scope.
- The polyfill's own host-only surface is small: `Intl.DateTimeFormat` ×14
  (calendar helpers, non-ISO only), `Intl.DurationFormat` ×9
  (`toLocaleString`), `Intl.supportedValuesOf` ×1, `WeakMap` ×2, `Reflect.ownKeys` ×1.

### The first real blocker (measured)

`compileMulti({ "polyfill.js": <jsbi+polyfill linked source> }, …, { target:
"standalone", hostBridge: "off", allowJs: true })` **succeeds in 58 s with zero
errors** and emits a binary that `WebAssembly.Module` rejects:

```
Compiling function #225:"OneObjectCache_setObject" failed:
if[0] expected type i32, found call of type anyref @+812257
```

Reduced to two lines (`.tmp/sa-temporal/red1.mts`, standalone, `hostBridge: "off"`):

| source | result |
| --- | --- |
| `class C { setObject(e){ if (C.objectMap.get(e)) throw …; C.objectMap.set(e,this);} } C.objectMap = new WeakMap();` | **INVALID** — `C_setObject`: if[0] expected i32, found anyref |
| `const m = new WeakMap(); … m.get(o) ? "hit" : "miss"` | **INVALID** — `__module_init`: same |
| the same with `Map` (`this.map.get(e)`, `t && 1`) | valid |

Root cause site: `tryCompileNativeWeakMethodCall`
(`src/codegen/weak-collections-runtime.ts` ~L191-197) returns
`{ kind: "anyref" }` for `get`, and the condition path
`ensureI32Condition` → `emitToBoolean` (`src/codegen/index.ts` L14950,
`#1917` cascade) has no row that turns a bare `anyref` into i32 — the Map
path returns a type the cascade does handle. Through `buildTemporalProvider`
with `compileOptions: { target: "standalone", hostBridge: "off" }` the linker
reports exactly this as `plan=bundled, reason=@js-temporal/polyfill provider
emitted invalid Wasm: … OneObjectCache_setObject …` after 113 s
(`.tmp/sa-temporal/probe2.mts`).

## Implementation Plan (Fable, 2026-09-07)

Slices land as separate PRs in this order. Each is measured, never assumed.

**S1 — the polyfill validates under standalone.**
1. Fix the reduction: `emitToBoolean` must accept `anyref` (route through the
   existing `__is_truthy` / `__any_unbox_bool` helper arm the cascade already
   has for `any`-typed values, or have the WeakMap `get` arm return the same
   ValType Map's `get` returns — pick whichever keeps Map and WeakMap
   byte-identical for the untouched shapes; state which). Add the two-line
   reduction to `tests/issue-5383-standalone-temporal-provider.test.ts`
   (standalone, `new WebAssembly.Module` must validate; run the module and
   assert `"hit"` / the RangeError message).
2. Re-run `.tmp/sa-temporal/probe3.mts` (copy it into your worktree's `.tmp/`).
   The polyfill is 157 KB of dense source; expect MORE invalid-Wasm defects
   behind this one. Iterate: for each `CompileError`, reduce to ≤10 lines the
   same way, fix, add the reduction to the test file. Stop when
   `WebAssembly.Module` validates. Record every reduction + function name in
   the PR. Budget: if a defect needs more than ~150 lines of compiler change,
   file it separately with the reduction and continue on the others.
3. Audit the validated binary's imports (`WebAssembly.Module.imports`): the
   standalone provider must import nothing outside `wasm:js-string` /
   `string_constants*` / declared `link:` targets — any `env.*` import is a
   #2961 leak and must be closed (native lowering) or reported with its
   count.

**S2 — the provider links separately under standalone.**
`buildTemporalProvider({ …, compileOptions: { target: "standalone", hostBridge:
"off" } })` must return `plan=separate` with a `Temporal` getter boundary and a
`__module_init` export. Fix whatever `fallbackReason` the linker gives next.
Then instantiate consumer + provider host-free (`instantiateLinkedProject`, no
JS host adapter — mirror how `scripts/test262-worker.mjs` instantiates
standalone modules) and assert `Temporal.PlainDate.from("2024-01-01").day ===
1` and `Temporal.Duration.from({hours: 1}).total("minutes") === 60`. This is
the smoke test for the slice.

**S3 — runner + CI wiring (after S2).**
- `tests/test262-shared.ts` / `scripts/test262-temporal.mjs`: the needs-Temporal
  gate is host-only; open it for `target === "standalone"` when a
  standalone-keyed prewarm stamp exists (`temporalProviderCacheKey` already
  fingerprints `target`; the stamp must carry the key of the artifact the lane
  will ask for — one stamp per target).
- `scripts/prewarm-temporal-provider.mjs`: build both artifacts (or take
  `--target`); `scripts/test262-worker.mjs` L1158-1180: drop the host-only
  refusal, keep the no-cold-build rule; the #2961 host-import guard must not
  count the provider's string-namespace imports as leaks.
- `.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml` `temporal-provider` job: currently
  gated on `run_host`; add the standalone artifact under `run_standalone`.
- FAIL SOFT stays: a missing/invalid standalone artifact leaves rows unlinked.

**S4 — retire the #661 lowering under standalone (after S3).** With a
provider linked, `src/codegen/temporal-native.ts` must not emit `__temporal_*`
host imports (454 compile_errors today): gate the lowering off when a
`Temporal` binding is linked (or off under standalone entirely — measure which
loses nothing).

**S5 — measure.** Per row, base vs fix, standalone lane, driver
`.tmp/bucket-run.mts` (copies in `agent-ad1118902ba570f58/.tmp` and
`agent-a5a33516fa53a63fe/.tmp`), fresh `JS2WASM_TEMPORAL_CACHE` per side:
the 123-row family (`family-123.txt`) and
`built-ins/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/prototype/**` (≤400 rows), then a bounded
`built-ins/Temporal/PlainDate/**` sample. 0 pass→fail against the standalone
high-water (#2097). Never the full bucket. Report Intl-dependent rows (66)
separately; they are expected to stay red.

**Order-preservation constraints.** The host lane is untouched: no change to
`--target gc` provider bytes (compare `temporalProviderCacheKey` and the host
artifact sha before/after S1). `Map`/`WeakMap` lowering in the JS-host lane is
byte-identical. Standalone modules that never mention `Temporal` compile
byte-identically (S4's gate must be keyed on the binding, not on the target
alone, unless measured as neutral).

## Acceptance criteria

1. S1: the linked polyfill source compiles under `--target standalone` to a
   binary `WebAssembly.Module` accepts; each reduction is a test.
2. S2: `buildTemporalProvider` with `target: "standalone"` returns
   `plan=separate`; the host-free smoke test passes.
3. S3–S4: standalone Temporal rows link the provider in both runners and CI;
   `__temporal_*` leaks are 0.
4. S5: samples measured, 0 pass→fail, counts with artifacts; the standalone
   Temporal bucket moves from 170 pass.

## Notes

- Predecessors: #4628 (provider, host lane; "Standalone scope — OUT"), #5353
  (sharded host lane), #2041 (standalone Temporal null-deref bucket, the
  pre-provider era), #2860 (standalone gap umbrella), #2162 (native
  WeakMap/WeakSet), #1917 (ToBoolean cascade), #2961 (host-import leak guard).
- Id reserved via `claim-issue --allocate --allow-unscanned` (PR scan degraded,
  no `gh`); open PRs hand-checked 2026-09-07 — highest in-flight issue file is
  #5381; fork PRs #5715-#5717 are #3518/#3527 slices.
- Probes: `/home/user/js2/.tmp/sa-temporal/{probe2,probe3,red1,red2}.mts`,
  `polyfill.mjs` (linked source), `polyfill-sa.wasm` (the invalid binary).

## Implementation notes — S1 (dev-5383, Opus 5 High, 2026-09-07)

**S1 is DONE and S2's structural half is DONE. What remains for S2 is a runtime
defect that has nothing to do with the provider seam — see "Where S2 stops".**

### R1 — the missing `anyref` row in the ToBoolean cascade

`src/codegen/coercion-engine.ts`, `emitToBoolean`. The plan offered two options;
**option (b) is vacuous** and that is worth recording, because it is the obvious
first move: `tryCompileNativeMapMethodCall` (`map-runtime.ts` L1744) returns
`{ kind: "anyref" }` for `get` too — *exactly* what the WeakMap arm returns. The
`map_get_if` row in `red1.mts` was valid only because it binds through a local
(`const t = m.get(k); t && 1`), which coerces on the way in. A bare
`if (m.get(k))` on a native **Map** is the same invalid Wasm, and is now a test.

So the fix is (a): an `anyref`/`eqref` row that does `extern.convert_any` and
calls `__is_truthy` — the same ToBoolean provider the `externref` row already
uses, so the two agree by construction rather than by coincidence. In standalone
that helper is a Wasm-native body (`registry/imports.ts` §7) that classifies the
#2106 tag-0/1 null/undefined singletons, i31, boxed number/bool/bigint and
`$AnyString`; a plain `ref.is_null` test would have made a `get` MISS, `0` and
`""` all truthy.

**Why this cannot perturb existing bytes in either lane:** before the row, an
`anyref` fell through to the i32 no-op tail, leaving an `anyref` where the
consumer requires i32. No module that reaches that tail can validate. So every
byte this changes belonged to a module that did not exist as a valid artifact.
Measured, not argued — see the A/B below.

### R2 — `recv.m?.(args)` leaked four host imports (#2961)

`src/codegen/expressions/calls-optional.ts`, `compileOptionalPropertyValueCall`.
It registered `__js_array_new` / `__js_array_push` / `__call_function` /
`__get_undefined` unconditionally. Attribution was measured, not guessed: a
temporary print at the `addImport` fallthrough in `ensureLateImport` named **one
call site** (the polyfill's `hr`) as the source of the compiled polyfill's entire
`env` import set.

Fixed with the host/native split `tryCompileCallableStaticField` already uses:
native lane takes `__objvec_new` / `__objvec_push` / `__apply_closure` (same
`(callee, thisArg, args) -> result` signature as `__call_function`) and
`canonicalUndefinedExternInstrs` for the short-circuit result. The host lane
keeps its four registrations, in the same order, emitting the same instructions.

The short-circuit value matters and is asserted: `ref.null.extern` surfaces as
JS **null**, so `o.missing?.(1) === undefined` needs the #2106 singleton.

### Measurements

| check | result |
| --- | --- |
| whole linked polyfill, `{target:"standalone", hostBridge:"off"}` | compiles in 60 s, **`WebAssembly.Module` ACCEPTS**, 2,956,918 B |
| its import list | **EMPTY** — no `env`, no `wasm:js-string`, no `string_constants` (S1 step 3: zero #2961 leaks) |
| host (gc) Temporal provider, before vs after | `temporalProviderCacheKey` `372a41be…` and artifact sha256 `baff93a9…` **identical**, 2,090,802 B both sides |
| standalone modules with no WeakMap / no optional-call (arith, classes, Map) | **byte-identical** before/after, on BOTH `standalone` and `gc` |
| the `o.f?.(a,b)` shape | standalone bytes change (that IS the fix); **`gc` bytes identical** |
| `equivalence-gate` | 0 new regressions; **2 baseline failures now PASS** (`fn?.()` on a closure — R2 collateral), baseline ratcheted |

Only ONE compiler defect stood between the polyfill and a valid binary; R2 was
found by the import audit, not by a further `CompileError`.

### Where S2 stops (precisely)

S2's link half is **already satisfied**, and `buildTemporalProvider` proves it
rather than reporting it: it *throws* unless the plan is `separate` with a
`Temporal` **getter** boundary (`src/temporal-provider.ts` L202-215). With
`compileOptions: {target:"standalone", hostBridge:"off"}` it now returns OK in
53 s — namespace `js2wasm:npm:@js-temporal/polyfill:3de2aca05e190a7f`, getter
`__js2wasm_get_Temporal_ba822575`, **`__module_init` exported**, artifact imports
**empty**. A consumer compiled with `compileWithTemporalGlobal(..., standalone)`
imports exactly one namespace — the provider — and nothing else.

**The remaining failure is not in the seam.** `instantiateLinkedProject(result,
{})` throws a WasmGC exception from the provider's `__module_init`, i.e. the
polyfill's own top-level init, *before* any consumer code runs — and it throws
**identically with no linker at all**, from a plain
`compileMulti(polyfill, {standalone, hostBridge:"off", deferTopLevelInit:true})`
whose `__module_init` is called directly (`.tmp/s2c.mts`). So it is a standalone
runtime defect in the polyfill's module init, not a provider-linking defect, and
it is the next slice.

**Naming it is blocked by a second, separate gap worth its own issue:**
`emitExceptionRenderExports` (#2962) does not put `__exn_render_prepare` /
`__exn_render_char` in the export list for an ordinary standalone compile — a
two-line `throw new TypeError("boom")` module exports only `run,__exn_tag`, even
though every documented gate passes (`standalone` ✓, `nativeStrings` ✓,
`exnTagIdx` 0, and the four prerequisites inside the emitter all resolve). Without
them the thrown payload is host-opaque and `renderHarnessThrownText` can only say
"non-stringifiable payload". Until that is fixed, the S2 throw cannot be attributed
to a line of the polyfill.

### Probes (this worktree's `.tmp/`)

`probe3.mts` (whole-polyfill compile + import audit) · `s2.mts` (provider +
host-free consumer link) · `s2b.mts` / `s2c.mts` (provider vs no-linker
`__module_init`) · `s2d.mts` (the render-export gap) · `ab.mts` (small-module
byte A/B) · `host-ab.mts` (host-lane provider key + sha A/B).

## S2 findings (2026-09-07) — three more defects fixed, and where init still stops

Re-ran the S2 probe with #5384's renderer in place (that fix is what made any of
this legible — before it, every one of these read as
`"uncaught Wasm-GC exception (non-stringifiable payload)"`).

Probe: `linkPolyfillSource(setupTemporalPolyfill())` (157,541 B) →
`compileMulti({ "polyfill.js": src }, "polyfill.js", { target: "standalone",
hostBridge: "off", allowJs: true, skipSemanticDiagnostics: true,
deferTopLevelInit: true })` → ~50 s, **2.92 MB, ZERO imports**, instantiates with
`{}` → call `__module_init` → render the payload.

| # | error the probe reported | root cause | fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R3 | `TypeError: called value is not a function` | `registerModuleClassStaticAssignments` (`src/codegen/index.ts`) admitted only an expression statement whose WHOLE expression is `=`. A minifier writes `JSBI.__kBitConversionInts = …, JSBI.__clz30 = …, JSBI.__imul = …` as ONE comma statement, so no static value cell was registered. A plain class survives on the host class-object setter; `class JSBI extends Array` has no such singleton, so the write went through `null`. | flatten top-level comma operands before the existing per-assignment admission (admission-only; no order/CF/delete change) |
| R4a | `TypeError: Math.imul is not yet implemented in --target standalone` | `emitMathValueReadBody` READS `__any_from_extern` / `__any_to_f64` / `__box_number` from `funcMap`, and nothing had registered them at that point — a body emitter must not register a native mid-body (#2704). So EVERY `Math.<fn>` value read declined, including #4565's own transcendentals: `[1,4,9].map(Math.sqrt)` still threw. | `prepareMathValueRead` in the value-read switch, before the wrapper/`FunctionContext` is built |
| R4b | same | no inline-kernel bodies: `Math.imul` / `clz32` / `floor` / `ceil` / `trunc` / `abs` / `sqrt` / `fround` have a short direct-call lowering, not a `Math_<name>` provider, so the value read had nothing to point at | `MATH_INLINE_F64_OPS` + the exact §7.1.6/7.1.7 ToInt32/ToUint32 reuse from `ir/backend/wasm-int32-coercion.ts`. `round`/`sign` deliberately excluded — `f64.nearest` rounds ties to even, §21.3.2.28 rounds toward +∞, so an entry would be a WRONG ANSWER, not a miss |
| R5 | `TypeError: Cannot access property on null or undefined at 1:381` (`_(i)`, jsbi's `var _ = Math.floor` in `BigInt(number)`) | two gates: `FIXED_ARITY_PLAIN_ALIAS_STATICS` did not include `Math.*`, and `identifierIsWrittenTo` was a file-wide SPELLING test — a minified bundle binds `_`/`t`/`g` in hundreds of scopes and assigns most of them, so the alias declined everywhere | widen the alias set to `Math.<fn>` names that have a real body (`mathValueReadHasBody`), and make both soundness gates scope-aware via an optional `sameBinding` predicate resolved through `ctx.oracle` (an unresolvable identifier still counts as a write, so it still declines) |

All four are reduced to ≤10-line cases in
`tests/issue-5383-standalone-temporal-provider.test.ts` (S2 R3 / S2 R4), each
asserting the value, plus a negative case (a genuinely reassigned alias still
declines) so the widening cannot silently swallow its own soundness gate.

### Where `__module_init` still stops

`TypeError: Cannot access property on null or undefined at 1:4117` —
jsbi's `static subtract(i,_){const t=i.sign; …}`, i.e. `subtract` is reached
with a **null argument**. Not reproducible in isolation: with the jsbi prefix
alone, `JSBI.subtract(JSBI.BigInt(5), JSBI.BigInt(3))`, `add`, `unaryMinus` and
`a.sign` all answer correctly. Prefix-bisecting the 342 top-level statements for
this exact signature first reaches it at statement **224**
(`function xo(t){ … return e.multiply(e.BigInt(t), c) }`), so the null is
produced by a top-level computation between statements 29 and 224 and only
observed later. Note prefix bisection is no longer sound past statement ~29 on
its own — a truncated prefix legitimately raises `ReferenceError: xo is not
defined` for a binding the full file declares later; the signature filter
(`SIG=1:4117`) is what keeps it usable.

Next step for whoever picks this up: instrument which top-level statement first
stores a null into a module binding that later reaches `JSBI.subtract`, rather
than bisecting further. One suspect worth checking first — measured while
reducing R4 and NOT yet fixed — is that a property write on a `class … extends
Array` instance (`constructor(n, s) { super(n); this.sign = s; }`) throws
`Cannot access property on null or undefined` on this lane; `subtract` reads
exactly `i.sign`.

### Not reached

The S2 smoke test from the plan (`buildTemporalProvider` +
`compileWithTemporalGlobal` + host-free `instantiateLinkedProject`, asserting
`Temporal.PlainDate.from("2024-01-01").day === 1` and
`Temporal.Duration.from({hours:1}).total("minutes") === 60`) is NOT written:
it cannot pass while `__module_init` throws, and a skipped assertion would be
worse than an honest gap.

## S2b findings (2026-09-08) — the externref-backed subclass family, and the new stop

The handover's suspect was right and INCOMPLETE. A property write on a
`class … extends Array` instance does throw — that is R6 below — but fixing it
alone changed nothing at the module level, because a second, larger defect sat
behind it: **a user METHOD on such an instance is unreachable through any
dynamic receiver**, and it fails SILENTLY, answering `null`. That silence is
why `JSBI.subtract` was reached with a null: it is not where the null was made.

Probe used throughout: the jsbi PREFIX of the linked bundle (28,942 B, up to
`l=e.multiply(h,i);`) plus a handful of exported one-liners. It compiles in
**5 s** against the whole file's ~45 s, exercises the same class, and is what
made the iteration loop usable — the whole-file probe was only re-run to
confirm each step.

### R6 — own-field write/read on an externref-backed subclass instance

`class B extends Array { constructor(n, s) { super(n); this.sign = s; } }`
threw `TypeError: Cannot access property on null or undefined` at the write.

Root cause: `compilePropertyAssignment` (`src/codegen/expressions/assignment.ts`)
consults `externrefBackedOwnFieldBacking`, which knows two carriers —
`$Error_struct` and a native `$Object` — and answers `undefined` for every
other parent. On `undefined` the code FELL THROUGH to the struct.set path, and
that path is unreachable-by-design here: the instance is a `$__vec_externref`
and never a `$B`, so `ref.test $B` always misses, the receiver narrows to
`ref.null $B`, and the #2084 null guard throws.

The field only reaches that path because the constructor's own assignment
FLOW-GROWS a `sign` slot onto the vestigial `$B` struct. The identical write
from outside the class (`b.sign = 1`) finds no slot, takes the #4149
`fieldIdx === -1` dynamic-store arm, and has always worked — so the class's own
constructor was the one place the write failed. Fix: route the unknown-backing
case to that SAME dynamic store, plus its read twin in
`property-access-dispatch.ts` (scoped to keys that actually have a flow-grown
slot, so a builtin member like `length` still reaches the array paths).

### R7 — a method is unreachable through a dynamic receiver (the real blocker)

| receiver spelling | `o.d(0)` before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `var x = new B(1); x.d(0)` | 5 | 5 |
| `function f(o) { return o.d(0); } f(b)` | **null** | 5 |
| `new B(1).d(0)` | **null** | null (unchanged, see below) |

A statically-typed receiver compiles to `call $B_d`. Anything the checker
cannot pin — and jsbi's statics take UNANNOTATED parameters
(`static toNumber(i) { … i.__unsignedDigit(0) … }`) — goes out through the
dynamic terminal, which resolves a method by `ref.test`ing instance identity
against each closed struct plus the open `$Object`. The carrier is none of
those. The host lane's answer is `__set_subclass_proto`, a JS host import, so
`emitSetSubclassProto` is a documented NO-OP standalone: nothing on the
instance says "B".

Measured consequence on the jsbi prefix, before the fix:
`JSBI.toNumber(JSBI.BigInt(5))` → `null`, `JSBI.add(5,3)` → `null`,
`JSBI.unaryMinus(x)` → `null`, `x.__copy()` → `null`. After: `5`, `8`,
non-null, non-null. The polyfill's `Ne = xo(ke), xe = e.unaryMinus(Ne),
Le = e.add(e.subtract(xe, l), n)` is one top-level statement; `unaryMinus`
returned null and `subtract` reported it, five frames later.

Two halves, both in the fix:

1. **`standalone-subclass-method-install.ts` (new).** At construction, install
   each declared instance method on the instance as an own data property at §17
   attributes — the same closure singleton, `__defineProperty_value` and flags
   `class-proto-object.ts` (#3976) uses for `C.prototype`. The dynamic
   terminals already consult the carrier's own-property side table (#3537 vec
   bag / #3468 closure bag).
2. **The method trampoline's `this` slot** (`closures/method-trampolines.ts`).
   Installing alone was not enough: the trampoline builds `this` by
   `ref.test`ing `__current_this` against the method's object struct, so the
   carrier failed that test too and every method ran with `this === null`
   (`this[0]` threw, `this.sign` answered null). For a method whose declared
   `this` is `externref` AND whose owner is externref-backed, the carrier is now
   passed straight through. The #2025 absent-receiver TypeError is preserved and
   tested.

**Alternatives measured and rejected** (each would put the methods where the
spec puts them, and each is a dead end today): `Object.setPrototypeOf(inst,
B.prototype)` → the standalone dynamic member path does not consult an explicit
prototype link on a non-`$Object` carrier, so the call still answers `null`;
`inst.__proto__ = B.prototype` → same; leaning on `B.prototype` itself →
`emitStandaloneClassProtoObject` explicitly DECLINES for a builtin-parent class,
so it is still the legacy defaulted struct. The deviation shipped instead is
that the methods are OWN rather than inherited (`hasOwnProperty("d")` answers
`true`); they are non-enumerable, so `Object.keys` / `for-in` are unchanged.

`extends Error` is EXCLUDED by measurement, not by policy: `__defineProperty_value`
does not reach an `$Error_struct`'s `$props` side-slot, so such a class got
5.8 kB of machinery and still answered "called value is not a function".
Deleting that one line is the whole fix once the Error carrier's dynamic member
path reads `$props`.

### Byte A/B (`.tmp/ab-base.txt` vs `.tmp/ab-new2.txt`, sha256, 6 modules × 2 targets)

**gc lane: all six byte-identical** (arith, plain class, `extends Array`,
`extends Error`, object-literal method, Map/WeakMap). Standalone: **only the
`extends Array` module changes**; arith, plain class, object-literal method,
Map/WeakMap and — after the Error exclusion — `extends Error` are byte-identical.

### Where `__module_init` stops NOW

Not in jsbi any more. `TypeError: Cannot access property on null or undefined`
at **4:94864**, which is
`"formatToParts" in ai.prototype || delete DateTimeFormatImpl.prototype.formatToParts`
— `ai` is `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, and standalone deliberately leaves the `Intl`
identifier `ref.null.extern` (#5206: "a compiled shim for it is a separate, much
larger gap"). The polyfill reads that namespace at top level in two places: the
cache `ct = Intl.DateTimeFormat` at 4:10198 and this `.prototype` probe.

An `Intl.<member>` → `undefined` arm was written and **reverted**: it clears the
first read and the second one then throws on `.prototype`, so it moved the
failure without removing it while changing standalone `Intl` semantics. Getting
past this needs one of, in increasing order of honesty:

1. the provider builder strips/stubs the Intl-dependent section of the polyfill
   for standalone (a provider-side decision — the 66 Intl-dependent Temporal
   rows are already out of scope per this issue's own plan);
2. a standalone `Intl` namespace whose members are constructible refusal
   closures carrying a real `.prototype` (the #5206 gap, properly);
3. ICU in Wasm (out of scope, permanently, for this issue).

Recommendation: **(1)**, as the S2 continuation — it is the only one that does
not require deciding the `Intl` shim question to link Temporal.

### Not reached (unchanged from S2)

The S2 smoke test (`buildTemporalProvider` + `compileWithTemporalGlobal` +
host-free `instantiateLinkedProject`) is still NOT written: `__module_init`
still throws, and a skipped assertion is worse than an honest gap. Everything
else in this slice is a test in
`tests/issue-5383-standalone-temporal-provider.test.ts` (S2b R6 / S2b R7,
9 cases, including the non-enumerability of the installed methods, the
untouched element/length surface, an unaffected plain class, and the preserved
absent-receiver TypeError).

## S2c findings (2026-09-08) — the Intl shim; `__module_init` RETURNS; the stop moves to the getter boundary

`__module_init` now **returns** under `--target standalone`, both as a plain
`compileMulti` of the bundle and through `buildTemporalProvider`'s real link
path. The S2 smoke test is still **not** written, and the reason is new and
elsewhere: the `Temporal` object does not survive the linked-provider **getter
boundary** on this lane.

### R8 — the `Intl` refusal shim (`src/temporal-intl-shim.ts`, provider-local)

S2b stopped at `"formatToParts" in ai.prototype`, because standalone leaves the
`Intl` identifier null by decision (#5206). The fix is **lexical and
provider-local**, not a codegen change: `buildTemporalProvider` writes the
synthetic package's `index.js` as `<shim>\n<bundle>` when
`compileOptions.target` is `standalone` or `wasi`, and verbatim otherwise.

The shape is dictated by the polyfill's own EAGER uses, each measured:

| polyfill line (top level) | what the shim must provide |
| --- | --- |
| `ct = Intl.DateTimeFormat`, `const ai = Intl.DateTimeFormat` | a constructor VALUE (`typeof === "function"`) |
| `"formatToParts" in ai.prototype \|\| delete DateTimeFormatImpl.prototype.formatToParts` (and the `formatRangeToParts` twin) | a real `.prototype` carrying both names, so the answer is TRUE and the polyfill does **not** delete its own methods |
| `di.supportedLocalesOf = ai.supportedLocalesOf` | any value; a static is fine (measured: a class static read as a VALUE answers `undefined` on this lane — harmless here, noted below) |
| `const {format,formatToParts} = Intl.DurationFormat?.prototype ?? …` and `Intl.DurationFormat?.prototype && (…)` | `DurationFormat: undefined`, so both short-circuit |
| `Intl.supportedValuesOf?.("timeZone")` (lazy, `hr`) | `supportedValuesOf: undefined` → the polyfill's own fallback, not a throw |

Everything else — the constructor and every method on the prototype — throws a
`RangeError` naming `--target standalone`. `DurationFormat`/`supportedValuesOf`
are deliberately `undefined` rather than throwing bodies: every use of them is
behind `?.` or `typeof … === "function"`, so a body would convert a graceful
degradation (`Duration.prototype.toLocaleString` falls back to the ISO string)
into a throw.

**A module-scoped `const Intl` DOES shadow the builtin on this lane** — measured
first, because the whole design depends on it: with the shim prepended,
`typeof ct === "function"`, `"formatToParts" in ai.prototype` is `true`, and
`new Intl.DateTimeFormat()` throws the shim's RangeError rather than reaching
`tryCompileIntlHostOnlyNew` (#5355). Standalone `Intl` semantics for user code
are unchanged: the binding lives in ONE compilation unit.

The shim text is part of the provider's identity: `temporalProviderCacheKey`
now fingerprints the EFFECTIVE source, so editing the shim re-keys the
standalone artifact and a stale binary cannot be served. **Host lane A/B, run
both ways in this worktree** (`.tmp/gc-ab.mts`, fresh cache per side):
key `372a41be…`, artifact sha256 `acd6ff4d…`, 1,701,105 B — **identical** before
and after.

Whole-bundle measurement with the shim (`--target standalone`,
`hostBridge: "off"`, `deferTopLevelInit: true`): 158,585 B of source (shim
1,043 B + bundle 157,541 B) compiles in **44 s**; through `buildTemporalProvider`
the artifact is **3,167,456 B** with an **empty** import list, and
`__module_init` **RETURNS**.

### Where it stops now — the getter boundary, not the polyfill

Measured two ways, which is what localises it:

| probe | `Object.keys(Temporal).length` |
| --- | --- |
| inside the standalone module itself (`Object.keys(qi)` appended to the bundle, after `__module_init`) | **9** |
| through `compileWithTemporalGlobal` + `instantiateLinkedProject(result, {})`, standalone | **0** |
| the same consumer probe on the host `gc` lane (control) | **9** (`Duration,Instant,Now,PlainDate,…`) |

So the standalone consumer receives an object (`typeof` `"object"`,
`String(...)` `[object Object]`, not null) with no own properties, and
`Temporal.PlainDate` is `undefined` — hence
`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'from')` for both smoke
assertions. `__module_init` ran (the linker calls it in `wireProviderInstance`)
and the namespace IS populated inside the provider. **This is a standalone
cross-module object-boundary defect and it is the next slice (S2d).**

Two further stops sit BEHIND that one, found by driving the polyfill from
inside its own module (so they are real, not boundary artifacts):

- `Temporal.PlainDate.from("2024-01-01")` → `TypeError: Unsupported dynamic
  regular expression pattern` — the polyfill parses ISO strings with a
  dynamically-built RegExp, which the standalone RegExp backend refuses.
- `Temporal.Duration.from({hours:1}).total("minutes")` and the
  `new Temporal.Duration(…)` spelling → `TypeError: invalid receiver: method
  called with the wrong type of this-object`.
- `new Temporal.PlainDate(2024,1,1)` → `RangeError: invalid calendar identifier`.

Fixing the boundary alone therefore will NOT make the two smoke assertions pass;
S2d needs all three. Recording them now so the next lane does not re-derive them
at 45 s per compile.

### Two small measured facts worth not re-deriving

- **A class STATIC read as a value answers `undefined`** on this lane
  (`ai.supportedLocalesOf` where `ai` is a class with `static
  supportedLocalesOf(){…}`). Harmless for the polyfill (it just copies the
  value onto its own object), but it is not what the spec says.
- **`Temporal.Now.timeZoneId()` answers `null` instead of throwing the shim's
  RangeError.** The polyfill's `Uo()` is
  `(new Intl.DateTimeFormat).resolvedOptions().timeZone`, and an isolated
  reduction of that exact spelling — a `new`-expression chain whose result is
  discarded by the caller — also swallowed the constructor's throw. The
  direct spellings (`new Intl.DateTimeFormat()`, `const f = new …; f.m()`,
  via an alias, with arguments) all throw correctly and are tests. The
  swallowing shape is NOT fixed here; it is filed with the S2d work above,
  and it is why the smoke test's "`Now.timeZoneId()` throws" assertion is not
  written either.

### Tests

`tests/issue-5383-standalone-temporal-provider.test.ts` gains six S2c cases:
the eager-use bitmask (all five shapes in one module), the lazy RangeError with
its `--target standalone` text, a prototype-method refusal, the `gc` cache key
recomputed from the raw bundle (the host-lane no-change guard), standalone/wasi
keys distinct from `gc`, and the shim's own shape (one `const Intl`, prefixed
binding).

## S2d findings (2026-09-08) — the getter boundary, root-caused and fixed; the stop moves INSIDE the provider

The S2 smoke test is still **not** written, and the reason moved again. What is
fixed: the cross-module object boundary, end to end, on a reduction. What now
stops Temporal is a provider-INTERNAL read, measured from both sides.

### R9 — why a provider-minted object arrived empty (two causes, not one)

**Cause 1 — the linker handed the consumer a JS host MIRROR.**
`instantiateLinkedProviders` wrapped every non-function boundary value in
`wrapLinkedProviderValue` → `_wrapForHost`, unconditionally. That mirror is
bound to the provider's `__struct_field_names` / `__sget_*` exports, which a
standalone binary does not have (#4035 strips the host bridge), and it is handed
to a consumer that is **wasm** and cannot read a JS proxy at all. Fixed by
skipping the mirror when the provider's own `targetProfile.environment` is not
`"javascript"` — the raw struct now crosses.

**Cause 2 — nothing on a standalone value says what it is.** With the raw struct
crossing, every read still answered `undefined`: standalone has no
self-describing property bag. `__extern_get` / `__object_keys` are module-local
`ref.test` ladders over the struct types THAT module declared (filled at
finalize), so a provider-minted struct misses every arm. The JS lane hides this
because #5225's `_crossModuleStructs` registry re-points a read at the module
that can decode it; there is no standalone twin.

Fixed by building that twin in pure wasm (`src/codegen/standalone-link-boundary.ts`):
a standalone provider whose consumer is wasm (`exportsConsumedByWasm`) publishes
`__js2wasm_link_member_get` / `__js2wasm_link_object_keys` / `__js2wasm_link_apply`,
and the consumer calls them on the arms where its own ladder has ALREADY missed
— the same two arms the host lane's `__boundary_object_get` /
`__boundary_object_keys` occupy, so neither lane grows an arm and the
single-module lane is untouched.

The two published reads are **wrappers, not re-exports**: each normalises "I do
not know this value" to `ref.null.extern`. Without that the consumer would have
to trust another module's `undefined` singleton, and the peer's empty key-vec
would out-rank the consumer's own carrier bags. Both normalisations are
answer-preserving (a genuinely-`undefined` property and a genuinely-empty object
fall back to the consumer's local miss, which answers the same).

**Measured** (`.tmp/s2d/probe3`, host-free `instantiateLinkedProject(result, {})`,
three carrier shapes — object literal, assigned own props, `defineProperty`):

| probe | base | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Object.keys(NS).length` | 0 | **3** |
| `NS.a` | `undefined` | **1** |
| `NS.zzz === undefined` | true | true |
| gc control | 3 / 1 | unchanged |

Four cases in `tests/issue-5383-standalone-temporal-provider.test.ts`.

Two things the facade does NOT yet cover, both measured: **calling a
provider-minted closure** (`keysOf(NS)` → `null`) and `hasOwnProperty` / `in` /
`for-in` for the non-`defineProperty` carriers — those terminals have their own
miss arms and were left for a follow-up rather than guessed at.

### Where it stops NOW — inside the provider, not at the boundary

Through the real provider the consumer still reads nothing, and the reason is no
longer the boundary. Measured with the terminals called directly from JS on the
EXACT value the consumer holds (identity checked, `.tmp/s2d/temporal-probe`):

- `__js2wasm_link_object_keys(Temporal)` → **non-null** (the provider enumerates
  its own namespace fine — 9 keys);
- `__js2wasm_link_member_get(Temporal, <consumer-minted "PlainDate">)` → **null**,
  and with the normalisation disabled it is the provider's own `undefined`
  singleton (the consumer agrees — `x === undefined` answers true for it, so the
  singleton itself crosses correctly).

So the provider's own `__extern_get` answers `undefined` for `qi.PlainDate`
while its own `__object_keys` lists all nine. That asymmetry is provider-local:
driving the polyfill from INSIDE its own module (`compileMulti` of shim+bundle,
`.tmp/s2d/in-provider`, referencing the bundle's real binding `qi` — a bare
`Temporal` identifier is intercepted by the #661 compile-time lowering and tests
nothing) answers `Object.keys(qi).length === 9`, `typeof qi.PlainDate ===
"function"`, `qi["Plain"+"Date"]` resolvable, `"PlainDate" in qi` true. **Next
lane's target: find which terminal serves the in-module read and why
`__extern_get` — the one the boundary can call — does not.** A first reduction
attempt (`.tmp/s2d/probe13`, an object literal whose values are classes) does
NOT reproduce it: there `__extern_get` returns the right class by identity, it
only mis-reports `typeof` as `"object"` instead of `"function"` (a separate,
smaller defect worth its own reduction).

### The other three stops, re-measured in-module (`.tmp/s2d/in-provider`)

Messages read back through the #5384 renderer (`__exn_render_prepare` /
`__exn_render_char`), host-free, zero imports:

| probe | answer |
| --- | --- |
| `Object.keys(qi).length` | **9** |
| `new qi.PlainDate(2024,1,1).day` | throws `invalid calendar identifier` |
| `qi.Duration.from({hours:1}).total("minutes")` | throws `invalid receiver: method called with the wrong type of this-object` |
| `qi.PlainDate.from("2024-01-01")` | throws `Unsupported dynamic regular expression pattern` → filed as **#5404** |
| `qi.Now.timeZoneId()` | **no-throw** (must raise the shim's RangeError) |

The last one is NOT a boundary artifact and NOT the "discarded result" shape the
S2c note guessed at — ten isolated spellings of that guess (bare `new`, no-paren
`new`, two-step, result used, result returned, result discarded, via a namespace
object, on both lanes) all propagate the constructor's throw correctly
(`.tmp/s2d/probe14`, `probe15`, `probe16`). The real trigger is narrower and
worse, and it reproduces in ten lines on BOTH lanes: **a property read on the
result of a `never`-returning call elides the entire receiver expression**, so
`(new Intl.DateTimeFormat).resolvedOptions().timeZone` never runs the
constructor at all (`ctorHits === 0`). Filed as **#5405** with the reduction and
the shape of the fix. Every shim method has a `throw`-only body, which is why
the shim is where it surfaced.

`invalid calendar identifier` and `invalid receiver` remain unreduced — S2d
spent its budget on the boundary and on root-causing the two above.
