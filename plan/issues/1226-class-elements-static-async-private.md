## Resolution 2026-05-01 (developer)

**Already fixed on current main — baseline drift, not a real bug.**

Smoke-tested all 104 reported failing files
(`benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl` filtered for
`class/elements + "not enough arguments"`):

```
category                     valid  invalid       CE    total
class/elements                 104        0        0      104
object/dstr                     12        0        0       12
class/dstr                       0       24        0       24
Array/prototype                  9       89       59      157
other                            4       18        1       23
```

All 104 `class/elements` files (the scope of this issue) compile to valid
Wasm. The 24 remaining `class/dstr` failures are the
"out-of-scope" set already noted at the bottom of this file; the 157
`Array/prototype` failures are a separate bug.

This matches the
[`feedback_baseline_drift_cross_check.md`](/workspace/.claude/memory/feedback_baseline_drift_cross_check.md)
pattern — the committed baseline JSONL is stale relative to current
`main` HEAD. The fix likely landed as a side-effect of the recent
closure / class / async series:

- #1196 bounds-check elimination
- #1197 i32 element specialization
- #1205 TDZ async-gen

Refreshing `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl` via the
`refresh-committed-baseline.yml` workflow (or the next test262-sharded
push to main) will drop the stale entries; the issue was already
resolved on the live runtime.

Captured the spec-correct behaviour in `tests/issue-1226.test.ts`
(5 tests, all passing) so the fix doesn't silently regress.

# #1226 — class/elements: static async private method invalid Wasm

## Problem

104 test262 tests in `language/expressions/class/elements` and
`language/statements/class/elements` produce invalid Wasm with the error:

```
not enough arguments on the stack for call (need 1, got 0)
```

All 104 failing tests share this combination:
- `static async` method (50%) or `static async generator` method (50%)
- `privatename-identifier` in the test filename

Sample WAT snippet from the failing test() function:
```wasm
(func $test (result f64)
  (local $C (ref null 22))
  (local $c (ref null 22))
  (local $e externref)
  nop
  (try (do call 30 ...))   ;; need 1, got 0
```

The `nop` before the `try` is a placeholder where an argument should be
pushed before `call 30`. The call expects 1 argument but the stack is empty.

### Failing test pattern

```js
var C = class {
  static async #$(value) {   // static async private method
    return await value;
  }
  static async #_(value) {
    return await value;
  }
};

Promise.all([
  C.$(1),   // L55 — call site that fails to compile
  C._(1),
]).then(results => {
  assert.sameValue(results[0], 1);
  assert.sameValue(results[1], 1);
}).then($DONE, $DONE);
```

The test covers many private name unicode variants
(`#$`, `#_`, `#\u{6F}`, `#℘`, `#ZW_‌_NJ`, `#ZW_‍_J`).

## Root cause hypothesis

When compiling a call to a `static async` private method (`C.#name(arg)`),
the codegen emits the call instruction but fails to push one of the required
arguments. The `nop` in the WAT suggests the stack-value generation path
for the argument was reached but produced no Wasm instruction.

Two likely causes:

**Cause A — `this` missing for async wrapper call**:
Static private methods are compiled as closures that capture the class
constructor. The async wrapper function (function 30 in the WAT) may need
the class reference as its first argument, but the compiler emits `nop`
instead of the class local push.

Look in `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` (or `expressions.ts`) where
`CallExpression` with a `PrivateIdentifier` callee is handled for static
async methods. Check if the `this` value (the class) is being pushed before
the internal async call.

**Cause B — missing value in async method prologue**:
The async function body compilation may start a `try` block for the
implicit async executor, and within that `try` block, call the async
promise constructor or `Promise.resolve()` without the expected argument.

Look in `src/codegen/async.ts` or wherever `AsyncFunctionBody` for class
methods is compiled. After emitting the `try`, check if the async executor
setup pushes its required argument before any call.

## Investigation steps

### Step 1 — Reproduce locally

```ts
// .tmp/check-1226.ts
const src = `
var C = class {
  static async #x(v) { return await v; }
};
var p = C.x(1);
`;
// Compile and check WAT for the call-before-push pattern
```

Run with `npx tsx .tmp/check-1226.ts` and inspect the WAT output. Find
function 30 (or whichever function has the empty-stack call). Identify
what the called function expects and what should be pushed.

### Step 2 — Locate the code path

Search for where static async private methods are compiled:
- `grep -n "PrivateName\|privateMethod\|static.*async" src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`
- `grep -n "PrivateName\|privateMethod\|static.*async" src/codegen/statements.ts`
- `grep -n "asyncMethod\|AsyncMethod\|try.*async" src/codegen/async.ts` (if it exists)

The WAT pattern `nop (try (do call N ...))` suggests the argument generation
emits `nop` (likely the result of an empty or no-op expression path) and
then the try block calls into the async executor.

### Step 3 — Fix: ensure argument is pushed before async call

Once the missing argument is identified (class reference, method context,
or promise executor argument), emit the correct `local.get` or computation
before the `call` instruction. The `nop` should be replaced with the
actual value.

### Step 4 — Check async-generator variant

52 of the 104 failures are `static async generator` methods (not just
async). After fixing the async method case, confirm the async-generator
method case is also fixed (same WAT pattern but in a different codegen path).

## Acceptance criteria

1. `tests/issue-1226.test.ts` reproduces the pattern and passes after fix
2. At least 80 of the 104 failing `class/elements` tests pass
3. `Promise.all([C.#x(1), C.#y(2)])` resolves correctly in a class with
   static async private methods
4. No regression in existing static async method tests (non-private)

## Test cases

```js
// Static async private method
var C = class {
  static async #x(v) { return await v; }
};
C.x(42).then(r => assert.sameValue(r, 42));

// Static async generator private method
var D = class {
  static async *#gen(v) { yield await v; }
};
D.gen(99).next().then(r => assert.sameValue(r.value, 99));

// Multiple unicode private names
var E = class {
  static async #$(v) { return v * 2; }
  static async #_(v) { return v + 1; }
};
Promise.all([E.$(3), E._(4)]).then(([a, b]) => {
  assert.sameValue(a, 6);
  assert.sameValue(b, 5);
});
```

## Related failures (separate issues, do not fix here)

- 27 `class/dstr` tests with `for struct.new` (static/private gen+async-gen + obj-ptrn-prop-obj)
- 156 `built-ins/Array/prototype` tests with `for local.set` / `for if` / `for array.set`
- 12 `language/expressions/object/dstr` tests with `for call (need 2, got 1)` in gen methods
