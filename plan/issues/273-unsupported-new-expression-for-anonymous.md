# Issue #273: Unsupported new expression for anonymous class expressions

## Status: done

## Summary
~31 tests fail with "Unsupported new expression for class: __class" as the sole error. These involve `new (class { ... })()` patterns where the class expression is anonymous. The codegen needs to support instantiating anonymous class expressions.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group B

## Complexity: S

## Scope
- Handle `new (class { ... })()` where the class has no name binding
- Generate a synthetic class name for anonymous class expressions used in new
- Ensure constructor calls work on inline class expressions
- Update `compileNewExpression` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Anonymous class expression instantiation compiles
- At least 20 compile errors resolved

## Implementation notes
- Added `anonClassExprNames` map to `CodegenContext` to track anonymous class expressions found in `new` expressions
- During the collection phase, `collectAnonymousClassesInNewExpr` recursively walks the AST to find `new (class {...})()` patterns, generates synthetic names like `__anonClass_N`, and pre-registers them via `collectClassDeclaration`
- During the body compilation phase, `compileAnonymousClassBodiesInNode` similarly walks the AST to find the same patterns and compiles the class bodies via `compileClassBodies`
- In `compileNewExpression`, when the unwrapped expression is a `ClassExpression`, looks up the pre-registered synthetic name and calls the constructor
- Parenthesized expressions around class expressions are unwrapped correctly
- Guards prevent double-registration and double-compilation when the same node is visited multiple times during recursive traversal
