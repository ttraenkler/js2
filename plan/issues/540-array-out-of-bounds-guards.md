# #540 -- Array out of bounds guards (14+ FAIL)

## Status: in-review
## Problem

14+ test262 tests fail at runtime with array out-of-bounds traps. Several code paths emit unchecked `array.get` or `array.set` on user-provided or compile-time indices without verifying the array is long enough.

### Affected paths

1. **Compound assignment** (`arr[i] += val`) -- unchecked `array.get` for read, unchecked `array.set` for write
2. **Prefix increment/decrement** (`++arr[i]`) -- unchecked `array.get` and `array.set`
3. **Postfix increment/decrement** (`arr[i]++`) -- unchecked `array.get` and `array.set`
4. **Logical assignment** (`arr[i] ??= val`) -- unchecked `array.get` and `array.set`
5. **Parameter destructuring** (`function f([a, b, c]) {}`) -- unchecked `array.get`
6. **Spread in super calls** (`super(...args)`) -- unchecked `array.get`
7. **Spread in function calls** (`fn(...args)`) -- unchecked `array.get`
8. **Destructuring member targets** (`[arr[idx]] = [val]`) -- unchecked `array.set`

Also fixed incorrect element type resolution: `"elemType" in arrayDef` was always false (the field is `element`, not `elemType`), falling back to `{ kind: "f64" }`.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done

- Added bounds-checked `array.get` using existing `emitBoundsCheckedArrayGet` helper for all read paths
- Created new `emitBoundsGuardedArraySet` helper that skips the write if index is out of bounds
- For prefix/postfix increment, wrapped entire read-modify-write in an `if` block conditioned on `idx < array.len` (using `i32.lt_u` for unsigned comparison to catch negative indices)
- Fixed element type resolution from `"elemType" in arrayDef` to `arrayDef.kind === "array" ? arrayDef.element : ...`
- Imported `emitBoundsCheckedArrayGet` in `index.ts` for parameter destructuring and super spread paths

### Files changed

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- 7 fixes (compound assignment read/write, prefix inc, postfix inc, logical assignment read/write, spread args, destructuring member targets, new `emitBoundsGuardedArraySet` helper)
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- 3 fixes (param destructuring nested patterns, param destructuring simple elements, super spread)
- `tests/null-dereference-guards.test.ts` -- new test file with 8 tests

### What worked

- The existing `emitBoundsCheckedArrayGet` pattern (save to locals, compare with `i32.lt_u`, if/then/else) was reusable for all read paths
- For writes, a simpler pattern works: check bounds, skip write if OOB (no need for a result value)

### Tests passing

- All 8 new bounds-checking tests pass
- No regressions in existing test suite (tested: arrays-enums, array-methods, array-capacity, classes, binary, control-flow, codegen, computed-props, class-methods, class-expressions, etc.)
