# #524 — Type '{}' missing Function properties (40 CE)

## Status: open

40 tests fail with "Type '{}' is missing the following properties from type 'Function': apply, call, bind, prototype". The compiler maps a plain object to a Function type context but the type system rejects it.

Likely a type mapping issue where anonymous functions or callbacks are typed as `{}` instead of a proper function type.

## Complexity: XS
