# #603 -- Remove ~5,100 stale skip filters blocking already-implemented features

## Status: in-review
~5,100 tests were blocked by skip filters for features that have been implemented or that were overly broad. The skip filters in `test262-runner.ts` were not updated when the corresponding issues were completed.

## Filters removed (15 total)

| Filter removed | Reason |
|---|---|
| "return undefined into arithmetic" | Overly broad regex, tests should CE/fail |
| "function expression in catch scope" | Overly broad regex, tests should CE/fail |
| "string comparison with supplementary unicode" | Tests should CE/fail rather than hide |
| "object property access (dot + bracket)" | Overly broad regex matching unrelated tests |
| "this.property at global scope" | Tests should CE/fail rather than hide |
| "loose equality between array references" | Overly broad, tests should CE/fail |
| "arithmetic on objects" | Few tests, should CE/fail rather than hide |
| "Array.prototype.method.call/apply" | 852 tests hidden; should CE/fail rather than hide |
| "array-like object with .length" | Overly broad regex |
| "prototype chain not supported" | 431 tests hidden; should CE/fail for visibility |
| "rest-destructuring with numeric-key object pattern" | Tests should CE/fail |
| "array index with string concat in loop" | Tests should CE/fail |
| "member expression as for-of LHS" | Tests should CE/fail |
| "parenthesized LHS in for-of" | Overly broad regex |
| "global/arrow this reference" | Tests should CE/fail rather than hide |
| "arrow returning undefined" | Tests should CE/fail rather than hide |
| "nested function/catch scope with type mismatch" | Tests should CE/fail |
| "function .name descriptor/bind/constructor.name" | Tests should CE/fail |

## Filters kept (genuinely needed)

- `HANGING_TESTS` -- prevents compiler infinite loops
- `raw flag` -- test format incompatibility
- `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES` set (Proxy, WeakRef, SharedArrayBuffer, RegExp, TypedArray, etc.)
- `eval()` body check -- eval genuinely cannot compile in AOT Wasm
- `new Function()` -- dynamic code generation impossible in Wasm
- `with` statement -- genuinely impossible to compile statically
- `dynamic import()` -- genuinely impossible in single-module Wasm
- `import.source` -- TC39 proposal not supported
- `_FIXTURE` imports -- missing test infrastructure files
- `unsupported include` -- missing harness files
- `Symbol unsupported patterns` -- Symbol.for/keyFor/prototype crash compiler
- `Reflect` -- genuinely unsupported
- `WeakMap/WeakSet` -- genuinely unsupported
- `Math.round precision` -- known incorrect behavior with large numbers
- `JSON.stringify replacer/space` -- only single-arg supported
- Tagged template filters (.raw, identity, IIFE tag, chained) -- genuinely unsupported

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

Removed 15 stale or overly broad skip filters from the `shouldSkip` function in `tests/test262-runner.ts`. These filters were hiding thousands of tests that should either pass (feature now implemented) or fail visibly as compile_error/runtime_failure rather than being silently skipped.

The philosophy: tests that CE or fail at runtime provide more signal than tests hidden by skip filters. Only filters that prevent compiler hangs or guard genuinely impossible features (eval, with, dynamic import, new Function) were kept.

### Files changed
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- removed 15 skip filter blocks, replaced with removal comments

### What worked
- Mechanical removal of filter code blocks
- Each removed filter replaced with a comment explaining why it was removed

### What didn't
- Could not remove eval/with/dynamic-import/Proxy filters as claimed in the original issue -- these features are genuinely unimplementable in AOT Wasm compilation
