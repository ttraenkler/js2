# #672 — WeakMap, WeakSet, WeakRef support

## Status: open

~580 tests use WeakMap/WeakSet/WeakRef.

### Approach
Use host-backed maps with externref keys:
1. `new WeakMap()` → host import `__weakmap_create() -> externref`
2. `weakmap.set(key, val)` → `__weakmap_set(map, key, val)`  
3. `weakmap.get(key)` → `__weakmap_get(map, key) -> externref`
4. `weakmap.has(key)` → `__weakmap_has(map, key) -> i32`

The JS host naturally provides weak reference semantics via its own WeakMap/WeakRef. We just bridge to it.

WeakRef: `new WeakRef(obj)` → `__weakref_create(obj)`, `.deref()` → `__weakref_deref(ref) -> externref|null`

# WeakMap/WeakSet/WeakRef via host imports

## Problem
~580 test262 tests use WeakMap, WeakSet, or WeakRef but these were being skipped because the compiler had no type declarations for them.

## Solution
Add type declarations to the lib files so the existing extern_class system picks them up automatically. The runtime already had WeakMap/WeakSet in builtinCtors; only WeakRef was missing.

## Tasks
- [x] Add WeakMap/WeakSet interface + constructor declarations to lib-es2015.ts
- [x] Add WeakRef interface + constructor declaration to lib-es2021.ts
- [x] Add WeakRef to builtinCtors in runtime.ts
- [x] Add "WeakRef" to LIB_GLOBALS in index.ts
- [x] Remove WeakRef from test262 skip filters
- [x] Remove WeakMap/WeakSet source-level skip filters
- [x] Write equivalence test
