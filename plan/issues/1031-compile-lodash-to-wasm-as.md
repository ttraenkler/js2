# #1031 — Compile lodash to Wasm as a real-world test corpus

## Goal

Use [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) as an out-of-band stress test for the js2wasm compiler. lodash is a large, mature, production JavaScript library that exercises a huge surface area of ES semantics (iterators, prototypes, closures, ArrayLike protocols, getter/setter patterns, deep equality, monkey-patch guards, lazy evaluation, etc.) — compiling it end-to-end against js2wasm exposes gaps that hand-written test262 tests and our equivalence suite don't find.

This is **not a direct pass-rate win**. It's an investigation/harvest task whose output is:

1. A reproducible driver that compiles (a subset of) lodash to Wasm
2. A categorized error-pattern report
3. A batch of follow-up issues, each targeting one concrete pattern

## Why lodash specifically

- **Broad JS surface:** lodash touches ~every ES idiom a real JS codebase uses (including the "weird stuff" nobody writes for test262 but everyone writes in real code).
- **Well-typed:** lodash ships with official TypeScript definitions (`@types/lodash`). js2wasm is a TS-to-Wasm compiler, so we can feed typed sources directly.
- **Pure library:** no DOM, no Node builtins beyond the standard ES lib — runtime surface is manageable.
- **Large enough to expose compounding:** at ~17K lines of non-trivial logic, one change can regress many features. Good stress test.
- **Benchmark value:** if we can get lodash running, it becomes a reusable perf + correctness benchmark for every future release.

## Approach

### Step 1 — Pick a tractable subset first

Compiling the entire `lodash-es` export at once will almost certainly blow up on the first unsupported feature. Start narrow and expand:

**Tier 1 (expected to compile cleanly or near-cleanly):**
- `lodash/clamp`, `lodash/inRange`, `lodash/random`
- `lodash/sum`, `lodash/mean`, `lodash/max`, `lodash/min`
- `lodash/identity`, `lodash/noop`, `lodash/constant`
- `lodash/add`, `lodash/subtract`, `lodash/multiply`, `lodash/divide`

**Tier 2 (array methods — known working after PR #68/#1022):**
- `lodash/chunk`, `lodash/compact`, `lodash/concat`, `lodash/fill`
- `lodash/flatten`, `lodash/head`, `lodash/initial`, `lodash/tail`, `lodash/last`
- `lodash/uniq`, `lodash/zip`, `lodash/unzip`

**Tier 3 (object / iteration — will exercise iterator + destructuring + Proxy paths):**
- `lodash/mapValues`, `lodash/pick`, `lodash/omit`, `lodash/invert`
- `lodash/keys`, `lodash/values`, `lodash/entries`

**Tier 4 (hard):**
- `lodash/cloneDeep`, `lodash/isEqual`, `lodash/merge`
- `lodash/debounce`, `lodash/throttle` (closures over time, potentially setTimeout)
- `lodash/memoize` (closure + Map)
- `lodash/chain` (lazy evaluation)

**Skip entirely (not portable):**
- Anything touching `Symbol.toPrimitive`, `Symbol.iterator`, `Symbol.asyncIterator` until we verify our Symbol support
- `_.template` (uses `Function` constructor — dynamic codegen, not supported)
- `_.now`, `_.isNative` (environment introspection)

### Step 2 — Build a harness

Create `scripts/lodash-stress.ts`:

```ts
import { compile } from '../src/index.ts';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

const modules = [
  'lodash/clamp',
  // ... tier list
];

for (const mod of modules) {
  const src = readFileSync(`node_modules/${mod}.js`, 'utf-8');
  // OR use the TypeScript declarations from @types/lodash + the JS impl
  const result = await compile(src, { fileName: mod });
  if (!result.success) {
    console.log(`FAIL ${mod}: ${result.errors[0]?.message}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`OK   ${mod}`);
  }
}
```

Install lodash + @types/lodash as dev dependencies (or fetch via CDN to avoid repo bloat).

### Step 3 — Categorize failures

Run the harness, capture all compile errors and runtime errors, bucket them using the same technique as `/regression-triage`:

- Normalize error messages (strip line numbers, specific identifiers)
- Group by message pattern + source construct
- Count each bucket

Expected categories (hypothesis based on today's test262 long tail):
- Unsupported AST nodes (`ts.*` kinds we don't handle)
- Missing host imports (`__extern_*` functions)
- Type-inference gaps (externref promotion, union narrowing)
- Iterator protocol edge cases (#1016)
- Prototype chain gaps (#739 Object.defineProperty correctness)
- Closure capture issues
- Symbol handling
- BigInt handling (#997)
- RegExp (if lodash uses it — some modules do)

### Step 4 — File follow-up issues

For each concentrated bucket (≥ 3 failures of the same pattern), file a new issue in `plan/issues/ready/` using the `create-issue` skill. Each follow-up should reference this issue (`parent: 1031`) and include:

- The lodash module(s) that hit the failure
- The specific AST construct or runtime semantic involved
- A minimal reproducer (extracted from the lodash source)
- Estimated impact (how many lodash modules unblock, plus any downstream lodash-dependent work)

### Step 5 — Document in the sprint doc

Append findings to `plan/issues/sprints/41/sprint.md` under a new section "lodash stress results":

```markdown
## lodash stress results

Total modules attempted: N
  Compile OK: X (Y%)
  Compile error: X
  Runtime error: X

Top error buckets:
  <count> <pattern> → #<followup-issue>
  ...

Follow-up issues filed: #NNNN, #NNNN, #NNNN
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `scripts/lodash-stress.ts` exists, runs, produces a report
- [ ] At least Tier 1 and Tier 2 modules attempted (≥ 25 modules)
- [ ] Error bucket report committed to `plan/issues/sprints/40/1031.md` or linked artifact
- [ ] ≥ 3 follow-up issues filed targeting concrete patterns
- [ ] Sprint 41 doc updated with findings
- [ ] At least one Tier 1 module compiles AND runs correctly (smoke test: `lodash/clamp(5, 0, 10) === 5`)

## Non-goals

- Full lodash compatibility — out of scope for this sprint
- Runtime parity with lodash-es — not required; we're harvesting errors, not shipping a replacement
- Upstream contributions to lodash — this is a private stress test

## Notes

- **Expect most modules to fail on first contact.** That's the point. Every failure is a signal, not a regression.
- Lodash is MIT-licensed — safe to vendor or reference-install.
- If lodash proves too ambitious, fall back to a smaller real-world library as the test corpus (e.g. `mitt`, `nanoid`, `ms`, `date-fns/format`).
- The benchmark value unlocks whenever Tier 1 + Tier 2 compile and run correctly — even partial success makes future regression catches much cheaper.

## Related

- Parent of: future lodash-harvested issues (TBD)
- Adjacent to: #1030 (Array.prototype long tail — many lodash array utils will hit the same gap)
- Benchmark layer: see #1005 (cold-start) and #1009 (report outliers) for perf instrumentation once lodash runs

## Architect Assessment (arch-npm-stress, 2026-04-11)

**Baseline commit:** 07ac0224

### Required compiler features

- Arithmetic + comparisons (Tier 1: clamp, inRange, sum, mean, identity, add, ...)
- `Array.prototype` long-tail methods (Tier 2: chunk, flatten, uniq, compact, zip, ...)
- `Object.keys` / `for...in` over structured objects (Tier 3: pick, omit, invert, mapValues)
- Iterator protocol for spread / destructuring / for-of
- Closure + `Map` for memoize, debounce, throttle (Tier 4)
- `Symbol.iterator` guards in `_.isArrayLike`, `_.isIterable`
- Generic structural traversal + prototype chain reads for `cloneDeep`
- RegExp in `_.words`, `_.kebabCase`, `_.camelCase`
- `Object.defineProperty`-based accessors on prototypes (sidecar lookup)

### Leverage TypeScript type information

lodash ships as plain `.js` with no bundled types. Install **`@types/lodash`** as a dev dep — `ts.resolveModuleName` (used by `ModuleResolver`) already looks in `node_modules/@types/*` via `typeRoots` and will pair each lodash `.js` file with its `@types/lodash` declaration at type-check time when `allowJs: true` + `checkJs: true` are set on the `ts.Program`. `options.allowJs` is already supported in `compileMultiSource` (`src/compiler.ts:65,70,85`, `src/checker/index.ts:276-309`). Verify that `compileProject` + `allowJs` correctly feeds lodash `.js` source bodies while taking signatures from `@types/lodash/index.d.ts` — if not, the gap is to extend `resolveAllImports` to BFS `.js` files when a `.d.ts` resolves, not the `.d.ts` itself. File a follow-up issue if this path needs work.

### Correction (2026-04-11): module graph already exists

An earlier version of this assessment incorrectly claimed the compiler has no module graph resolver. That is wrong. **`compileProject(entryFile)`** (`src/index.ts:216`) already uses **`ModuleResolver`** (`src/resolve.ts:27`, backed by `ts.resolveModuleName` + Node fs) to walk the transitive import closure via **`resolveAllImports`** (`src/resolve.ts:204`) and hands every reachable file to **`compileMultiSource`** (`src/compiler.ts:406`), which runs one shared `ts.Program` across all of them. `preprocessImports` is only the single-file `compile()` fallback and is NOT on the multi-file path. See tests: `tests/resolve.test.ts`, `tests/equivalence/multi-file-compilation.test.ts`. Playground usage: `playground/main.ts:1879`.

Lodash should be compiled by pointing `compileProject` at `node_modules/lodash/clamp.js` (or the module entry). No pre-bundle scaffold is required. The real question is which construct-level features of lodash's actual source break codegen — answerable by running the stress test, not by projection.

### Current compiler gaps

- **`for...in` / `Object.keys` over WasmGC-opaque structs** — still partial, tracked by #853. Affects `_.forOwn`, `_.keys`, `_.mapValues` on user-struct inputs.
- **`Object.defineProperty` prototype-pollution patterns** — wrapper-prototype writes recently fixed in #1026, but non-wrapper prototypes are still fragile.
- **`Symbol.iterator` set directly on a user struct** — routes via runtime.ts:1991 sidecar, JS-host-mode only.
- **`cloneDeep` on cyclic structures** — needs WasmGC-object-keyed WeakMap for identity memoization; works in JS-host mode via runtime.ts:16 `_wasmStructProps` WeakMap; broken in standalone.
- **Recent destructuring null/rest soft spots** — #1024, #1025 merged but watch for regressions on deeply-nested patterns that lodash uses.

### Projected readiness (JS-host mode, via `compileProject`)

| Tier | Modules | Readiness |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 — pure math / identity (`clamp`, `identity`, `noop`, `add`, `sum`, ...) | ~12 | **~90%** compile + unit-test clean |
| Tier 2 — array helpers (`chunk`, `flatten`, `uniq`, `compact`, `zip`, ...) | ~15 | **~70%** after #1022/#1030/#1040 |
| Tier 3 — object iteration (`mapValues`, `pick`, `omit`, `invert`, `keys`, `values`, `entries`) | ~10 | **~40%** — limited by `for...in` / `Object.keys` on WasmGC objects |
| Tier 4 — hard (`cloneDeep`, `isEqual`, `merge`, `memoize`, `debounce`, `throttle`) | ~8 | **~10%** — WeakMap identity + timers |

### Top 3 blockers

1. **`for...in` / `Object.keys` correctness on WasmGC objects** → #853, open. Affects Tier 3 (`pick`/`omit`/`mapValues`/`invert`/`keys`/`values`/`entries`).
2. **`cloneDeep` memoization needs object-keyed WeakMap** → works in JS-host via runtime.ts:16, broken in standalone. Not a Sprint-41 blocker but worth tracking for the WASI path.
3. **Unknowns surfaced by real lodash source** — `Object.defineProperty` prototype-pollution patterns on non-wrapper prototypes, Symbol.iterator on user structs, deeply nested destructuring. Will surface as concrete issues when the stress test actually runs.

### Implementation sketch for the Tier 1 smoke test

```bash
# 1. Install lodash (source is ESM, resolvable via node_modules)
pnpm install --save-dev lodash @types/lodash

# 2. Compile through js2wasm via compileProject (walks the transitive import graph)
tsx src/cli.ts node_modules/lodash/clamp.js -o .tmp/lodash-clamp.wasm

# 3. Smoke test
# call exported clamp(5, 0, 10) via the standard harness runner, assert === 5
```

If this passes end-to-end, Tier 1 is unblocked and #1031's "at least one Tier 1 module compiles AND runs correctly" acceptance criterion is met.

**Recommendation:** start today. `compileProject` is the entry point. Lodash Tier 1 is the shortest path to "real npm library running in Wasm" — no precondition work required.

## Stress Test Results (dev-1031, 2026-04-11)

**Branch:** `issue-1031-lodash-tier1` — commit pending
**Baseline:** 2b3bd136 (Sprint 40 end-of-day)
**Test harness:** `tests/stress/lodash-tier1.test.ts` (6 tests, all passing and encoding current behavior)

### TL;DR

**Worst-case branch of the dispatch.** The "recommendation" in the Architect Assessment above was wrong: compiling `node_modules/lodash/clamp.js` through `compileProject` does NOT work today. The architect correctly identified that the module graph walker exists (`ModuleResolver` / `compileProject`), but didn't verify the end-to-end path. Actual observed behavior:

| Entry | Compile success | Binary bytes | Function exports | Usable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lodash/identity.js` (CJS) | ✓ | 102 | `[]` | No — CJS unsupported |
| `lodash/clamp.js` (CJS) | ✓ | 623 | `[]` | No — CJS unsupported |
| `lodash-es/identity.js` (ESM) | ✓ | 102 | `[]` | No — `export default` dropped |
| `lodash-es/clamp.js` (ESM) | ✓ | (fails WebAssembly.compile) | — | No — codegen type mismatch |
| `lodash-es/add.js` (ESM) | ✓ | (fails WebAssembly.compile) | — | No — undeclared fn ref |
| Shim `.ts` importing lodash-es | ✓ | 229 | `[run]` | No — lodash body never linked in |

Root cause (below) is a chain of issues that all have to be fixed before any lodash module can run. The Tier 1 acceptance criterion ("`lodash/clamp(5,0,10) === 5`") is NOT met by this PR; it is deferred to the follow-ups.

### Findings

**1. `ModuleResolver` returns `.d.ts` when `@types/*` is installed.** `ts.resolveModuleName` in Node10 mode prefers the type declaration over the `.js` body. `resolveAllImports` then walks only the declarations. A shim like `import identity from "lodash-es/identity.js"` pulls in `node_modules/@types/lodash-es/identity.d.ts` but never `node_modules/lodash-es/identity.js`. The `run` function in the shim compiles to a stub that calls no lodash implementation at all. → Filed as **#1060**.

**2. `compileMultiSource` drops `allowJs` and forces `.js → .ts`.** Even when a `.js` file is handed to `compileMultiSource` directly, `analyzeMultiSource` does not accept `allowJs`, its `ts.createProgram` call doesn't enable `allowJs`/`checkJs`, `normalizeFileName` rewrites `.js` to `.ts`, and `getSourceFile` hardcodes `ts.ScriptKind.TS`. Single-file `compileSource` handles `.js` fine, so the gap is exclusive to the multi-file path — which is the one needed here. → Filed as **#1061**.

**3. Real codegen bugs on `lodash-es/clamp.js` and `lodash-es/add.js`.** Even pointing `compileProject` directly at the ESM files (ignoring #1060/#1061), codegen emits invalid Wasm for two Tier 1 modules:

- `clamp.js` → `toNumber` fails validation with `if[0] expected type i32, found call of type externref`. Branch-merge or coercion bug in the type-coercion pass. → Filed as **#1062**.
- `add.js` → `createMathOperation` fails validation with `undeclared reference to function #11`. Closure / function-table indexing bug, likely around `addUnionImports` or function-slot allocation. → Filed as **#1063**.

### Follow-up issues filed

- **#1060** ModuleResolver `.d.ts`/`.js` pairing — ready, medium feasibility
- **#1061** `analyzeMultiSource` allowJs support — ready, medium feasibility
- **#1062** lodash-es/clamp.js codegen bug (`toNumber`) — ready, hard feasibility
- **#1063** lodash-es/add.js codegen bug (`createMathOperation` closure) — ready, hard feasibility

All four reference `parent: 1031`. #1060 + #1061 unlock the "compile a real lodash module via compileProject" workflow; #1062 + #1063 then need to be fixed before any Tier 1 lodash module actually runs. `lodash/identity.js` and `lodash/noop.js` will likely come first once #1060 + #1061 land, since their bodies are trivial.

### Unchanged

- Acceptance criterion "one Tier 1 module compiles and runs correctly" is **not yet met**. Reclassify per the dispatch's worst-case branch: "demonstrate what the blocker is so the next attempt can unblock."
- Architecture Principle (dual-mode JS host) not violated — no compiler source was modified in this PR.

### Callback frame follow-up (2026-08-09)

The pinned npm-compat catalog entry now reaches code generation without the
previous callback-frame failure. In lodash 4.18.1, the callback at
`lodash.js:6835` reads the function-local array `result`, while the same
module also registers a user function named `result` in the global `funcMap`.
The old name-only skip therefore omitted the real capture and left the callback
body with an outer-frame local index (`__cb_26` → local 258).

`compileArrowAsCallback` now asks the checker for the declaration behind each
direct callback reference before applying the function-map skip. A lexical
binding wins over a same-spelled function entry; transitive nested-function
captures are retained as environment values. The reduced regression is
`tests/dogfood/lodash-callback-frame-regression.mjs` and compares the compiled
callback result (`"a|b"`) with native Node. With the old skip it traps with an
illegal cast; with the fix it validates, instantiates, and matches the oracle.

The full published entry remains blocked by a separate latent validator defect:
the catalog harness reports `transform` (function #813) with
`expected externref, got (ref null 2)`. The emitted `transform` function is
byte-identical before and after the callback fix (confirmed from selected WAT
output), so this is not a regression from capture remapping. The full entry
therefore reports compile success but validation failure and no honest lodash
API workload is run yet; this blocker needs its own follow-up.

### Full-bundle validation follow-up (2026-08-09)

The two subsequent validation failures were independent representation bugs.
Conditional direct-call branches used the checker join type as if it were each
branch's physical Wasm result; the reduced `arrayEach`/`baseForOwn` regression
now joins the actual emitted result types and returns `42` through both arms.

After that fix, lodash reached a repeated-frame capture failure in `unzip`.
The `runInContext` function expression is emitted once as a stored closure and
again through a direct call. Its nested-function capture metadata retained the
first frame's boxed `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` slot, while the second frame boxed the
same binding at a different local. Reading the stale local supplied an unrelated
reference to the closure constructor. Closure materialization now selects the
current frame's ref cell only when the recorded capture type, live box registry,
and current local all agree on the same ref-cell type and the recorded slot does
not. This deliberately preserves the restricted lookup introduced after the
broad local-map-first attempt in #1177 regressed Test262.

`tests/issue-1031-lodash-nested-frame-capture.test.ts` reproduces both emissions
with valid JavaScript. The old code produces valid Wasm but traps with an illegal
cast during module initialization; the fixed code instantiates and returns
`42`. The exact pinned lodash 4.18.1 catalog source now compiles to a validating
Wasm binary. The catalog still has no honest runtime differential workload for
the monolithic bundle, so this result is recorded as compile + validate rather
than runtime compatibility.

### What this PR ships

The stress-test harness `tests/stress/lodash-tier1.test.ts` encodes the current broken behavior as passing assertions. Follow-up fixes in #1060-#1063 will flip those assertions into correctness checks. The harness doesn't modify any compiler source — it's pure investigation.
