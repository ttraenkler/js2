# #1120 -- Add int32 fast path for bitwise-coerced numeric loops in hot benchmarks

## Problem

The competitive runtime benchmark exposed a real optimization gap in the current
codegen for integer-style hot loops.

The iterative benchmark in:

- `benchmarks/competitive/programs/fib.js`

uses explicit JavaScript int32 coercion:

```js
const next = (a + b) | 0;
```

The generated WAT currently stays in `f64` for the loop body, then synthesizes
full `ToInt32`-style coercion around each update. That produces a hot path with
repeated sequences like:

- `f64.add`
- `f64.trunc`
- `f64.div`
- `f64.floor`
- `f64.mul`
- `f64.sub`
- `i32.trunc_sat_f64_u`
- `i32.or`
- `f64.convert_i32_s`

This is correct, but much more expensive than a direct `i32` loop.

By contrast, the recursive benchmark in:

- `playground/examples/benchmarks/fib.ts`

already demonstrates the lean numeric path we want for hot code when the types
are proven.

## Why it matters

This issue directly affects benchmark credibility and the performance story:

- V8 optimizes the `|0` pattern very well
- js2wasm currently preserves JS semantics conservatively but misses the obvious
  integer fast path
- the result is that `js2wasm` loses on exactly the kind of tight arithmetic
  benchmark that should be competitive

## Goal

Preserve correct JS `ToInt32` behavior while lowering proven bitwise-coerced
numeric loops to a direct `i32` path.

## Requirements

1. Detect loop-local numeric patterns where values are consistently forced
   through `|0` or equivalent int32-preserving operations
2. Keep loop-carried locals in `i32` instead of bouncing through `f64`
3. Lower arithmetic updates like `(a + b) | 0` directly to `i32.add` plus the
   required int32 semantics
4. Hoist or eliminate repeated loop-bound conversions where possible
5. Preserve correctness for mixed-type, overflow-sensitive, and non-proven paths

## Acceptance criteria

- Competitive benchmark `fib.js` no longer emits repeated float-to-int-to-float
  coercion sequences in the loop body
- The hot loop lowers to a materially leaner `i32`-centric WAT shape
- Runtime performance improves on the Node-hosted and/or Wasmtime benchmark path
- Existing numeric correctness tests still pass

## Notes

- This is separate from the recursive `fib` optimization already tracked and
  fixed in `#897`
- This is narrower than `#1126`, which tracks the broader question of when JS
  `number` flows can be safely lowered to signed or unsigned 32-bit integer
  domains even without explicit `|0`-style syntax
- The new competitive benchmark should keep both variants side by side:
  - recursive `fib` as the clean numeric reference
  - iterative `fib.js` as the int32 fast-path stress case
