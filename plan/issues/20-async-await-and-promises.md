# Issue 20: Async/Await and Promises

## Status: done

> Superseded by #30

## Summary
Support `async` functions and `await` expressions, enabling asynchronous patterns like `fetch`, `setTimeout` callbacks, and Promise-based APIs.

## Motivation
Async/await is ubiquitous in modern TypeScript, especially for DOM/browser APIs (fetch, timers, animations, event streams).

## Design

### Challenge
WebAssembly functions are synchronous. There's no native suspend/resume mechanism in the current WASM spec (JSPI — JS Promise Integration — is a Stage 3 proposal).

### Approach A: JSPI (preferred, but requires engine support)
With JSPI, a WASM function can be marked as suspending. When it calls a host function that returns a Promise, the WASM stack suspends and resumes when the Promise resolves.

```js
const instance = await WebAssembly.instantiate(module, imports, {
  suspending: new WebAssembly.Suspending(asyncHostFunction)
});
```

### Approach B: CPS transform (complex, portable)
Transform async functions into a state machine at compile time, similar to what TypeScript's downlevel emit does. Each `await` becomes a state transition.

This is very complex and essentially requires implementing a coroutine system.

### Approach C: Host-side wrapper (simplest)
Async functions compile as regular functions. `await` calls are host imports that block (in practice, the host queues the continuation). Limited to simple sequential async patterns.

**Recommended: Start with Approach C for `setTimeout`/`requestAnimationFrame`, explore JSPI when stable.**

## Scope
- `src/codegen/statements.ts`: recognize async function declarations
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: await expression → host import call
- `src/codegen/index.ts`: async function registration
- Runtime: Promise wrapping

## Complexity: L

## Out of scope
- `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`
- Async generators
- Top-level await

## Acceptance criteria
- `async function f() { await delay(100); return 42; }` compiles
- Host-provided async functions can be awaited
- Return value of async function is wrapped in Promise on host side
