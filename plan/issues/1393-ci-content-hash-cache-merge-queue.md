# #1393 — Content-hash test262 cache + GitHub Merge Queue

## Problem

Two related issues compound each other:

### 1. Baseline drift in parallel CI

With 6-8 PRs in CI simultaneously, each PR's differential compares its branch shards
against main shards captured at push time. When another PR merges first, the comparison
baseline is stale — producing spurious regressions/improvements. Currently managed with
`baseline_stale` detection (#1391) and tech-lead GATE_BYPASS authorizations, but this is
manual overhead and an error-prone bottleneck.

### 2. Redundant CI re-runs post-merge

After a PR merges into main, CI re-runs the full test262 sharded suite on main — even
though the branch CI already ran on the exact same source content. This doubles the CI
cost for every merge.

## Root cause

Both problems stem from the same design: the test262 shard cache is keyed by **git commit
SHA** (`probe main cache` step), not by **compiler source content**. A different SHA always
means a cache miss, even when `src/**/*.ts` is byte-identical.

The invariant that makes content-hashing safe already holds in the workflow: devs are
required to merge `origin/main` into their branch before pushing (`CLAUDE.md`:
"Dev merges origin/main INTO their branch"). So:

```
branch source = main_source_at_merge_time + PR_delta
main source after ff-merge = branch source   ← identical content
```

If the cache is keyed by `sha256(src/**/*.ts sorted)`, the post-merge main CI hits the
cache from the branch run. No re-run needed.

## Solution

Two changes, deployed together:

### Change 1 — Content-hash cache key in `test262-sharded.yml`

Replace the git-SHA cache key with a hash of compiler source content:

```yaml
# Current (in probe-main-cache job and shard cache steps):
key: test262-main-${{ github.sha }}

# New:
- name: Compute src hash
  id: src-hash
  run: |
    echo "hash=$(find src -name '*.ts' | sort | xargs sha256sum | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    key: test262-src-${{ steps.src-hash.outputs.hash }}
    restore-keys: test262-src-
```

Apply the same key to:
- `probe main cache` job (check if main results exist)
- Each `branch shard N` job's result upload
- The `merge main shards (and cache)` job's result store
- The `promote-baseline` job's skip condition

**Effect**: after a branch CI completes on a properly pre-merged branch, the results are
stored under the source hash. When main CI runs post-merge (same source), it finds the
cache immediately and skips all 16 shards. CI cost: ~30 seconds (cache probe) vs ~12
minutes (16 shards).

### Change 2 — Enable GitHub Merge Queue on `main`

In GitHub repository settings → Branches → main branch protection rule:

1. Enable **"Require merge queue"**
2. Set merge method: **Merge commit** (consistent with current `--merge` flag)
3. Required checks for merge queue: `differential gate (branch vs main)`, `quality`
4. Max queue size: 4 (prevents convoy while allowing batching)

**Effect**: when a dev adds their PR to the merge queue, GitHub:
1. Creates a virtual merge of the PR onto current main
2. Runs CI on that virtual merge (which hits the content-hash cache if branch already
   pre-merged up-to-date main)
3. Only lands the PR when CI passes
4. Each subsequent PR in the queue is tested against the just-merged main

Combined with Change 1, this makes the merge queue essentially zero-cost for the common
case: the virtual merge has the same `src/` content as the branch CI already tested, so
CI is a cache hit.

### Change 3 — Update dev-self-merge skill

Update `.claude/skills/dev-self-merge.md` to replace `gh pr merge --admin --merge` with:

```bash
gh pr merge NNN --auto --merge
```

`--auto` adds the PR to the merge queue and waits. Remove the GATE_BYPASS machinery —
it becomes unnecessary since the merge queue guarantees each PR is tested against true
current main.

The CI status file (`/workspace/.claude/ci-status/pr-NNN.json`) remains the mechanism
for detecting when CI is done; the dev-self-merge skill reads it before calling
`gh pr merge --auto`.

## Acceptance criteria

1. After a branch CI run completes, pushing a merge commit to main that contains identical
   `src/**/*.ts` content triggers CI that completes in under 60 seconds (cache hit).
2. Two PRs merged in sequence: the second PR's differential shows zero drift — it is
   always compared against the main that includes the first PR.
3. No GATE_BYPASS is needed for the common drift-only regression pattern.
4. `gh run list --branch main --limit 5` shows merge-queue runs completing in <2 minutes.

## Files

- `.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml` — cache key change (Change 1)
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` — may need merge-queue trigger update
- `.claude/skills/dev-self-merge.md` — replace `--admin --merge` with `--auto --merge`
- GitHub branch protection settings for `main` — enable merge queue (manual UI step)

## Implementation record (done 2026-05-08)

**Change 1 — Content-hash cache**: Already fully implemented in
`.github/workflows/test262-differential.yml` before this issue was filed:
- `check-main-cache` job computes `git rev-parse ${BASE_SHA}:src` (Git tree object hash
  of the entire `src/` directory — inherently sorted, deterministic).
- Cache key: `test262-main-results-${{ steps.tree.outputs.sha }}`
- Line ~234: `if: needs.check-main-cache.outputs.cache_hit != 'true'` skips all 16 main
  shards on hit.
- Uses `pull_request.base.sha` (not `origin/main` tip) to avoid drift from concurrent PRs.
- Post-merge comment in the workflow explicitly documents the invariant: "after a normal
  --merge merge, main's src/ tree equals the just-merged branch tip's src/ tree."
- No action required.

**Change 2 — GitHub Merge Queue**: ⚠️ ATTEMPTED AND ROLLED BACK on 2026-05-08.

Ruleset 16153215 was created via the GitHub Rulesets API (enforcement: active, refs/heads/main,
MERGE method). It immediately blocked CI bot pushes to main — specifically the
`quality / Commit regenerated planning artifacts` step and `Refresh Committed Baseline`
workflow, which both push directly to main using `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The GitHub Rulesets API
rejected adding the GitHub Actions integration (ID 15368) as a bypass actor on a personal
(non-org) repo with error "Actor GitHub Actions integration must be part of the ruleset
source or owner organization." Ruleset deleted to unblock CI.

**Root cause**: GitHub's merge queue ruleset (on personal repos) has no supported bypass
for `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `github-actions[bot]`. This CI pattern of bots pushing directly to
main is incompatible with merge queue enforcement.

**Required to make merge queue viable**:
Option A — Convert `loopdive` to a GitHub Organization (enables org-level bypass actors).
Option B — Eliminate bot direct pushes to main (route them through PRs or use a
  `workflow_dispatch` that bypasses the rule via a scoped PAT stored as a secret).
Option C — Keep using `--admin` merges (current approach) and rely on baseline_stale
  detection (#1391) + content-hash caching for drift mitigation. No merge queue needed.

**Change 3 — dev-self-merge.md**: Updated Step 5 merge command from
`gh pr merge <N> --merge --admin` to `gh pr merge <N> --auto --merge`.
The `--auto` flag queues the PR via the merge queue (or merges immediately when all
required checks pass if the queue is not active for this PR size).

## Notes

- The Git tree-hash approach (`git rev-parse SHA:path`) is preferable to `sha256sum` over
  file contents because it's already computed by Git, handles sorted paths natively, and
  is O(1) via the object database.
- The `baseline_stale` detection from #1391 remains as a fallback but fires much less
  often now that the merge queue serializes merges against true current main.
- Branch shards that fail still gate the merge queue — the cache hit optimization only
  applies when branch CI fully passes.
