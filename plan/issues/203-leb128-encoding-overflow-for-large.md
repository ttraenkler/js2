# #203 — LEB128 encoding overflow for large type indices

## Status: backlog

## Summary
~20 test262 tests fail with wasm validation "extra bits in varint" or "length overflow while decoding immi64". The binary encoder produces malformed LEB128 when encoding large type indices.

## Motivation
~20 wasm compile errors across arithmetic and comparison operator tests. When tests use many types (objects with valueOf, functions, etc.), the type section grows large and type indices exceed what the current LEB128 encoder handles correctly.

This is a fundamental bug in the binary emitter that affects any test creating enough types to push indices beyond single-byte LEB128 range.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — LEB128 encoding utilities (sleb128, uleb128)
- Specifically encoding of type indices in function signatures and instructions

## Complexity
S

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] LEB128 encoder correctly handles type indices > 63
- [ ] No "extra bits in varint" wasm errors
- [ ] 20 test262 compile errors fixed
