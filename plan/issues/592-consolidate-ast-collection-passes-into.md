# #592 — Consolidate AST collection passes into single visitor

## Status: in-review
The compilation pipeline (index.ts) walked the AST 19+ times for separate collection functions: `collectConsoleImports`, `collectPrimitiveMethodImports`, `collectStringLiterals`, `collectMathImports`, etc.

Each is O(n) for n AST nodes -> O(19n) total. A single visitor collecting all metadata is O(n).

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Created `collectAllSourceImports(ctx, sourceFile)` function that performs a single `ts.forEachChild` walk over the AST
- The unified visitor (`unifiedVisitNode`) dispatches to all 19 collector logic blocks on every node
- Each collector's state is held in a `UnifiedCollectorState` interface (closure-free)
- Post-walk finalization (`finalizeUnifiedCollector`) registers imports based on accumulated state, preserving the exact same import registration order
- Updated both `generateModule` (single-file) and `generateMultiModule` (multi-file) call sites
- `collectExternDeclarations`, `collectEmptyObjectWidening`, `collectUsedExternImports`, and `collectDeclaredGlobals` are kept separate since they have different walk patterns (top-level only, or depend on extern class registration)
- Original individual `collect*` functions preserved for reference and independent use

### Special handling
- `collectStringLiterals` skips computed property names via an `insideComputedPropertyName` depth counter, so other visitors can still see those nodes
- Early-exit optimizations preserved (e.g., `callbackFound`, `wrapperFound`, `generatorFound` guards)

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — added unified collector (~500 lines), updated call sites in generateModule and generateMultiModule
- `tests/unified-collector-592.test.ts` — new test file exercising multiple features (Math, arrows, exponentiation, etc.)

### Tests now passing
- All existing tests pass (no regressions)
- New test file: 7 tests covering Math.abs, Math.pow, arrow functions, loops, Math.floor/ceil, Math.min/max

## Complexity: M
