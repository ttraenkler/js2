## Implementation Summary

Fixed vec-struct constructor short-circuit in `src/runtime.ts`.
The `__extern_get` resolver now uses a `__vec_len` probe to positively
identify vec wrappers before returning Array as the constructor.
Only objects for which `__vec_len(obj)` returns a number are treated
as arrays; class instances and closures throw and fall through.

Result: +1 test262 pass, 0 regressions.
