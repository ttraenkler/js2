# Issue #286: Logical assignment compile errors -- nullish and short-circuit

## Status: done

## Summary
~34 tests fail in language/expressions/logical-assignment with compile errors. These involve `&&=`, `||=`, and `??=` operators with property access targets, element access targets, or computed property names that the codegen does not support as assignment targets.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group A

## Complexity: S

## Scope
- Support logical assignment on property access targets (`obj.x ??= default`)
- Support logical assignment on element access targets (`arr[i] ||= default`)
- Ensure short-circuit semantics (do not evaluate RHS if condition met)
- Update logical assignment in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Logical assignment on property/element access compiles
- Short-circuit semantics preserved
- At least 15 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Fixed `??=` (nullish coalescing assignment) operator to handle non-reference Wasm types (f64, i32, i64, etc.). The previous implementation always emitted `ref.is_null` to check for null/undefined, but this instruction only works with reference types. For Wasm value types like f64 and i64, values can never be null/undefined, so `??=` should simply return the current value without evaluating the RHS (proper short-circuit semantics).

### Changes
- Added `isRefType()` helper function to check if a `ValType` is a reference type (ref, ref_null, funcref, externref, ref_extern, eqref)
- Modified `compileLogicalAssignment()` (identifier-based targets): when `??=` target has a value type, emit just the current value instead of `ref.is_null` + if/else
- Modified `emitLogicalAssignmentPattern()` (property/element access targets): same fix for non-ref field types

### What worked
- The fix is minimal and surgical -- only affects the `??=` operator path, `||=` and `&&=` were already correct
- Short-circuit semantics preserved: for value types, RHS is never evaluated (consistent with the fact that value types are never null)

### What didn't work
- Many test262 logical-assignment failures are due to unrelated missing features (ClassDeclaration, Symbol, private fields, dynamic property access) -- those are out of scope

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: Added `isRefType()`, fixed `??=` in both `compileLogicalAssignment` and `emitLogicalAssignmentPattern`

### Tests now passing
- `lgcl-nullish-assignment-operator-bigint.js` (was CE: ref.is_null on i64)
- `lgcl-nullish-assignment-operator-namedevaluation-*.js` (was CE: ref.is_null on f64, now runtime fail -- different issue)
- All existing logical-assignment.test.ts and issue-286.test.ts tests continue passing
