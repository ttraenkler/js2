# #416 -- Compound assignment on element access (non-ref targets)

## Status: in-review
11 tests fail when compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.) are applied to element access expressions like `arr[i] += value`. The compiler cannot resolve the target type for the read-modify-write sequence.

## Root cause

`compileElementCompoundAssignment` handles externref and ref/ref_null targets but falls through to an error for primitive targets (f64, i32, i64). When the object expression compiles to a primitive type (e.g., a variable declared as `number` via the test262 wrapper's `var base = undefined` -> `var base: number = 0` transform), element access compound assignment fails with "Compound assignment on non-ref element access".

Related to #393 (done) which added externref element compound assignment, and #404 (done) which fixed compound assignment on unresolvable property types.

## Example failures

- `test/language/expressions/compound-assignment/S11.13.2_A7.10_T4.js`
- `test/language/expressions/compound-assignment/S11.13.2_A7.1_T4.js`
- `test/language/expressions/compound-assignment/S11.13.2_A7.2_T4.js`

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `arr[i] += value` compiles correctly for array types
- [x] `obj[key] *= value` compiles for object types with known fields
- [x] Primitive (f64/i32/i64) targets box to externref and use the externref path
- [x] CE count for compound assignment element access reduced to 0

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added handling for primitive (f64, i32, i64) object types in `compileElementCompoundAssignment`. When the object expression compiles to a primitive type, the value is boxed to externref via `coerceType`, then the existing externref element access compound assignment path is used (read via `__extern_get`, unbox, operate, box, write via `__extern_set`).

### What worked
- The coerceType infrastructure already handles f64/i32/i64 -> externref boxing via `__box_number`
- The externref element access compound assignment path (added by #393) handles the rest

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- added primitive target handling in `compileElementCompoundAssignment`
- `tests/equivalence/compound-assignment-nonref-element.test.ts` -- new test file with 4 tests

### Tests
- 4 new equivalence tests passing (plus-equals, multiply-equals, xor-equals on any-typed objects, array element compound assignment)
- All 670+ existing equivalence tests continue to pass (3 pre-existing failures unrelated)
