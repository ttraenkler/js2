# Issue #716: Regression from #695 null-guard TypeError throws

## Problem

After #695 (TypeError on null property access), `emitNullGuardedStructGet` throws
TypeError when accessing properties on null struct refs. But #706 changed ref.cast
to return `ref.null` on type mismatch. Together: valid object with wrong struct
type -> ref.null fallback -> null-guard throws TypeError -> test fails.

This caused ~1,202 pass-to-fail regressions in test262.

## Fix

Reverted `emitNullGuardedStructGet` to return default values (f64.const 0,
ref.null, i32.const 0) instead of throwing TypeError. Also simplified
`emitExternrefToStructGet` to use a single `ref.test` check (which covers
both null and type-mismatch) instead of a nested null-check + type-check.

The TypeError throw is preserved ONLY on the externref `__extern_get` path
(around line 18700) where the source value is truly null/undefined.

## Implementation Summary

- **What was done**: Changed `emitNullGuardedStructGet` then-branch from
  `typeErrorThrowInstrs(ctx)` back to `defaultValueInstrs(resultType)`.
  Simplified `emitExternrefToStructGet` from nested null+type check to single
  `ref.test` check with default values on mismatch.
- **Key insight**: struct-path null guards should return defaults (the object
  exists but has wrong type), externref-path null guards should throw (the
  value is truly null/undefined).
- **Files changed**: `src/codegen/expressions.ts`
- **Tests**: null-property-access-throws.test.ts still passes (externref path
  still throws), illegal-cast-guard.test.ts passes.
