# #901 -- Remove helper-call coercion from numeric GC-array element access

## Problem

The `bench_array` regression is materially driven by helper-call coercion inserted around numeric element writes and reads.

Current regressed shape:

- `call 22` before `array.set`
- `call 21` after `array.get`
- repeated `f64.convert_i32_s` / `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` in the hot loop around loop indices and element access

Older fast shape:

- direct `array.set`
- direct `array.get`
- direct `f64.add`

The benchmark evidence is already documented in parent issue [#896](/Users/thomas/Documents/Arbeit/Startup/Projekte/Mosaic/code/@loopdive/ts2wasm/plan/issues/sprints/34/896.md). This subissue isolates the likely primary cause.

## Requirements

1. Identify which coercion path inserts the helper calls before numeric `array.set` and after numeric `array.get`
2. Identify where unnecessary `f64`/`i32` loop-index conversions were introduced in the hot path
3. Prove when the array element type and index representation are already the correct numeric Wasm types
4. Emit direct typed element/index access in those cases
5. Preserve helper/coercion fallbacks for ambiguous, mixed, or externref-backed element cases
6. Add regression coverage that structurally asserts the direct element-access shape

## Acceptance criteria

- numeric `number[]` hot paths no longer emit helper calls around direct GC-array element access
- unnecessary repeated `f64`/`i32` conversions are removed from the benchmark hot loop where the compiler can stay in one numeric representation
- `bench_array` WAT again shows:
  - direct `array.set`
  - direct `array.get`
  - direct numeric consumption
- correctness for dynamic element-type cases is preserved
