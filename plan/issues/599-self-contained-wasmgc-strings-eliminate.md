# #599 -- Self-contained WasmGC strings: eliminate wasm:js-string dependency

## Status: in-progress

ts2wasm depends on `wasm:js-string` imports for ALL string operations. These do not exist outside browsers/V8/SpiderMonkey. Wasmtime, wasmer, wazero, and WASI runtimes cannot provide them.

This is the #1 blocker for non-browser deployment (serverless, CLI, embedded).

## Approach

Implement strings as WasmGC arrays of i16 (WTF-16 encoding to match JS semantics):
```
(type $String (array (mut i16)))
```

All string operations (concat, slice, indexOf, charCodeAt, comparison) become pure Wasm functions operating on these arrays. No host imports needed.

## Trade-off
- Browser: wasm:js-string is faster (V8 inlines these). Keep as optional fast path.
- Non-browser: WasmGC arrays are the only option.
- Compile flag: `nativeStrings: true` (auto-enabled for `fast: true` and `target: "wasi"`)

## Complexity: L (largest single feature for portability)

## Implementation Notes

The native string implementation already existed behind the `fast` flag. This change decouples
native strings from fast mode (i32 numbers) by introducing a dedicated `nativeStrings` flag:

1. Added `nativeStrings?: boolean` to `CompileOptions` (src/index.ts)
2. Added `nativeStrings: boolean` to `CodegenContext` (src/codegen/index.ts)
3. Auto-enabled when `fast: true`, `target: "wasi"`, or explicitly `nativeStrings: true`
4. Can be explicitly disabled with `nativeStrings: false` even when `fast: true`
5. Replaced ~50 occurrences of `ctx.fast && ctx.nativeStrTypeIdx >= 0` and similar patterns
   with `ctx.nativeStrings` across index.ts, expressions.ts, and statements.ts

Pre-existing issue: `__str_padStart` helper has a type error that prevents runtime instantiation
of modules with native string helpers. This is not introduced by this change.
