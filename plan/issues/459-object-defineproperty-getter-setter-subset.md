# #459 — Object.defineProperty getter/setter subset

## Problem
React and many libraries use `Object.defineProperty(obj, key, { get() {...}, set() {...} })` to define computed properties. Full descriptor support (writable/enumerable/configurable) is infeasible in WasmGC, but the getter/setter pattern maps directly to struct accessor methods.

## Approach
Support only the getter/setter form — ignore descriptor metadata:

```typescript
// Supported:
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'x', { get() { return this._x; } });
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'x', { get() {...}, set(v) {...} });

// Not supported (silently ignored or compile error):
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'x', { value: 42, writable: false });
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'x', { enumerable: false });
Object.freeze(obj);
Object.seal(obj);
```

## Implementation
- Detect `Object.defineProperty(target, key, descriptor)` calls in codegen
- If descriptor has `get` and/or `set`: compile as struct accessor methods
  - The target must be a known struct type (not a generic object)
  - The key must be a string literal (known at compile time)
  - Add getter/setter functions to the struct's method table
- If descriptor has `value`/`writable`/`enumerable`/`configurable`: emit compile warning, treat as regular field assignment
- `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` → return a struct with get/set/value fields

## Test Impact
- Unblocks property descriptor tests that only use getter/setter pattern
- Required by React for some internal property definitions

## Acceptance Criteria
- `Object.defineProperty(obj, 'x', { get() { return 42; } })` works
- `obj.x` calls the getter
- Setter variant works with `obj.x = value`
- Non-getter/setter forms produce a clear compile error

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Extended `compileObjectDefineProperty` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` to handle `get` and `set` descriptor properties. When a descriptor object literal contains `get` and/or `set` (as method shorthand or function expression), the compiler now:

1. Resolves the target's struct type and the property name (must be a string literal)
2. Registers the property in `classAccessorSet` (same mechanism used by class and object literal accessors)
3. Creates and compiles getter/setter functions with the struct type as `this` parameter
4. Subsequent property reads (`obj.x`) and writes (`obj.x = v`) are automatically intercepted by the existing accessor machinery

### Key details
- Supports method shorthand (`get() {...}`), function expression (`get: function() {...}`), and arrow function (`get: () => ...`) syntax
- Explicit TS `this` parameter annotations (`get(this: MyClass) {...}`) are filtered out to avoid duplicate `this` in the Wasm function signature
- When both `value` and `get`/`set` are present, `value` takes precedence (matching JS behavior where value+getter is invalid but we handle gracefully)
- Falls through to existing paths (struct.set for value descriptors, externref for non-struct targets)

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — extended `compileObjectDefineProperty` function
- `tests/equivalence/object-define-property-accessors.test.ts` — new test file (5 tests)

### Tests now passing
- getter returning constant
- getter returning computed value from backing field (using `this`)
- getter and setter together
- setter modifies backing field
- getter with function expression syntax
