# #991 -- Iterator helper generator-reentrancy tests hit 30s compiler timeout

## Problem

The last full official-scope recheck (`benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260407-005506.jsonl`)
contains **3 compile timeouts** in the same feature family:

- `test/built-ins/Iterator/prototype/filter/throws-typeerror-when-generator-is-running.js`
- `test/built-ins/Iterator/prototype/flatMap/throws-typeerror-when-generator-is-running.js`
- `test/built-ins/Iterator/prototype/map/throws-typeerror-when-generator-is-running.js`

Each test burns the full **30s worker timeout**, so this cluster alone costs
~90s of worker time per full run.

## Why this is a real bucket

These are not random slow tests. They all exercise the same semantic shape:

1. Iterator helper method (`filter` / `flatMap` / `map`)
2. generator already running / re-entrancy guard
3. expected TypeError path

That strongly suggests a shared compiler/codegen slow path rather than isolated
test harness noise.

## Suspected root cause

Likely candidates:

- iterator helper lowering recursively compiles or inlines generator helper paths
- re-entrancy guard code triggers pathological closure/helper generation
- iterator helper built-ins interact badly with generator state objects in fast mode

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§27.1.4.2 Iterator.prototype.take](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-iteratorprototype.take) — creates a wrapper iterator that yields at most `limit` values
- [§27.1.4 Properties of the Iterator Prototype Object](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-iterator-prototype-object) — iterator helper methods (map, filter, take, drop, etc.)


## Suggested fix

1. Reproduce one file in isolation with compile tracing enabled
2. Identify the shared slow path in Iterator helper lowering / generator state handling
3. Reduce compile complexity or break the pathological recursion
4. Add a regression test or perf guard so these tests no longer hit 30s

## Acceptance criteria

- all 3 generator-reentrancy Iterator helper tests compile in <5s locally
- no `compile_timeout` remains for this cluster in a full recheck
- full-run wall time drops measurably
