# #559 — Addition/subtraction result not coerced to externref before call (10 CE)

## Status: in-review
10 tests fail with "call[0] expected type externref, found f64.add/f64.const/i32.const". The root cause is in `compileStringBinaryOp`'s arithmetic path.

### Root cause

When `compileStringBinaryOp` handles arithmetic operators (-, *, /, %) on operands where one is a string type, it blindly calls `parseFloat` (which expects externref) on both operands without checking their actual compiled type. If one operand is `new Number(1)` (which compiles to f64 since wrapper constructors return primitives) or `true` (which compiles to i32), passing f64/i32 to `parseFloat(externref)` causes a Wasm validation error.

### Fix

In both the fast-mode and non-fast-mode arithmetic paths of `compileStringBinaryOp`, check the actual result type from `compileExpression` before applying conversion:
- f64: already numeric, no conversion needed
- i32: convert via `f64.convert_i32_s`
- ref/ref_null: convert via `extern.convert_any` then `parseFloat`
- externref: convert via `parseFloat` or `__unbox_number`

### Tests affected
- `language/expressions/subtraction/S11.6.2_A3_T2.2.js`, `S11.6.2_A3_T2.5.js`
- `language/expressions/multiplication/S11.5.1_A3_T2.2.js`, `S11.5.1_A3_T2.5.js`
- `language/expressions/division/S11.5.2_A3_T2.2.js`, `S11.5.2_A3_T2.5.js`
- `language/expressions/modulus/S11.5.3_A3_T2.2.js`, `S11.5.3_A3_T2.5.js`
- `language/expressions/addition/S11.6.1_A2.2_T2.js`, `S11.6.1_A3.2_T2.*` (addition tests)

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Fixed `compileStringBinaryOp` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` to check the actual compiled type of each operand in the arithmetic path before attempting to convert to f64. Previously, both operands were unconditionally passed to `parseFloat` (which expects externref), but operands like `new Number(1)` compile to f64 and `true` compiles to i32.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: Modified both fast-mode and non-fast-mode arithmetic paths in `compileStringBinaryOp`
- `tests/issue-559-coerce-call-args.test.ts`: Added 10 test cases covering subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus with mixed string/number/wrapper types

### What worked
- Checking the result type from `compileExpression` and branching on f64/i32/ref/externref
- The fix covers all arithmetic operators (-, *, /, %, **, &, |, ^, <<, >>, >>>)

## Complexity: S
