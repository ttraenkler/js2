# #171 — Boolean() edge cases

## Problem
1. `Boolean("")` returned `true` instead of `false` — empty strings were treated as truthy
2. `Boolean(void_expr)` treated void/undefined results as truthy instead of falsy
3. Test runner's `assert_sameValue` only accepted `number`, not `boolean` arguments

## Fix
1. In `Boolean()` codegen (`src/codegen/expressions.ts`):
   - Added string truthiness check: for `externref` strings, call `wasm:js-string` `length` import and check `!= 0`
   - Added native string check: for `ref` strings, use `struct.get` on field 0 (length) and check `!= 0`
   - Added void/null handling: `Boolean(void_expr)` returns `false` (i32.const 0)
   - For ref types (objects, arrays), drop the ref and push `1` (always truthy)

2. In test runner (`tests/test262-runner.ts`):
   - Added `assert_sameValue_bool` and `assert_notSameValue_bool` for boolean comparisons
   - Route assertions with `true`/`false` arguments to boolean-typed overloads

## Tests unblocked
- `built-ins/Boolean/S15.6.1.1_A1_T4.js` now passes (was compile_error)
- Boolean: 8 → 9 pass, 1 → 0 compile_error

## Status: Done
## Complexity: XS
