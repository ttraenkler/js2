# Standalone: invalid Wasm binary emitted

## Problem

In `--target standalone`, some modules compile to a binary the engine rejects:

```
invalid Wasm binary (WebAssembly.instantiate(): Compiling function #N:"<fn>" ...)
```

This is a **correctness** bug — the worst class, since the module is structurally
broken, not merely missing a feature.

### Impact (measured 2026-06-30) — 523 standalone-only failures (all CE)

By the rejected function name:

| function | tests | note |
| -------- | ----- | ---- |
| `test` (harness/user) | 199 | a common emitted body shape |
| `inner` | 81 | nested function shape |
| `__uri_decode` | 46 | native decodeURI/decodeURIComponent impl |
| `fn` | 42 | |
| `__uri_encode` | 18 | native encodeURI/encodeURIComponent impl |
| `__str_flatten` | 10 | native string flatten |
| `C_setPrivateReference` | 10 | private-field accessor |
| `gen` / `__closure_*` / `__cb_*` | ~40 | |

The `__uri_encode`/`__uri_decode` (64 combined) and `__str_flatten` carriers are
concrete native helpers emitting invalid bytes — the most isolated sub-bugs.

## Root cause (to confirm during triage)

Standalone-only invalid binaries usually mean a stack-balance / type-mismatch in
a `ctx.standalone`-gated emission path, or a late-import funcIdx shift that
wasn't propagated (cf. the `addUnionImports` index-shift hazards in CLAUDE.md and
`reference_1461`/`reference_2191`/`reference_2193`). The two named native
helpers (`__uri_*`, `__str_flatten`) are self-contained — disassemble one failing
module with `binaryen`/`wasm-objdump` to get the exact validation error
(stack-height, type, or bad funcref).

## Implementation Plan

This is **triage-then-fix**, not a single known edit. Procedure:

1. **Reproduce minimally** — pick one test per named function (e.g.
   `test/built-ins/decodeURI/**` for `__uri_decode`,
   `test/built-ins/String/prototype/split/**` for `__str_flatten`). Compile with
   `--target standalone`, dump the WAT, and read the validator's exact complaint
   (write probes under `.tmp/`).
2. **`__uri_encode`/`__uri_decode`** (64): inspect the native helper emission
   (grep `__uri_encode`/`__uri_decode` in `src/codegen/`); fix the
   stack/type/funcidx defect. Likely a single shared bug across both.
3. **`__str_flatten`** (10): same approach — overlaps the null-deref string
   cluster (umbrella #2860 note).
4. **`test`/`inner`/`fn` body shapes** (322): these are user/harness bodies, so
   the defect is a general codegen construct mis-emitted under standalone.
   Cluster the offending source constructs (look for a shared syntactic feature
   across the failing files) and fix the emitter. Use the validator error to
   localize (e.g. "type mismatch in ... expected externref got anyref" →
   a missing `extern.convert_any`/`any.convert_extern` on a standalone path).

Split into sub-tasks if the `__uri_*`/`__str_flatten` fixes are independent from
the body-shape fix (they likely are — file a follow-on for the residual after
the named helpers are fixed).

## Test plan

Standalone CE → pass:
- `test/built-ins/{decodeURI,decodeURIComponent,encodeURI,encodeURIComponent}/**`
- `test/built-ins/String/prototype/split/**` (RegExp-arg `__str_flatten`)
- the `reduceRight`/`substring`/`func-decl-forbidden-ext` examples listed in the
  triage.

Validate by re-compiling each repro to a valid module, then full `merge_group` +
standalone high-water. Pure correctness win — no host-mode path touched.

## Resolution (2026-06-30) — URI carriers fixed; residual → #2878

Fixed the `__uri_encode`/`__uri_decode` carriers (the named, most-isolated
sub-bugs — 81 invalid binaries across the four URI test dirs alone, > the 64
estimate).

### Root cause

`src/codegen/uri-encoding-native.ts` built `throwURIError` as a **shared
`const Instr[]`** and spread it (`...throwURIError`) at ~13 throw sites in each
helper. A spread is shallow, so the single `{ op:"call", funcIdx: uriErrCtorIdx }`
(and the `{ op:"throw", tagIdx }`) Instr **objects** were aliased at every site.
When a late import was added after the helper was emitted (e.g. a thrown user
class + `e instanceof URIError` pulling in `__box_boolean` / the error
constructor), the index-shift walker `shiftLateImportIndices`
(`src/codegen/expressions/late-imports.ts`) mutates `instr.funcIdx += delta`
**once per occurrence** while walking the body — so the shared `call` object was
shifted ~13× instead of once, landing on an out-of-range / wrong-signature
function. The single-occurrence `__str_flatten` call was shifted correctly, which
is why only the URIError-throw path corrupted. Class: shared-Instr-object
aliasing (`reference_shared_instr_object_dce_double_remap`).

### Fix

Make `throwURIError` a **factory** (`(): Instr[] => [...]`) returning fresh Instr
objects per call; replace every `...throwURIError` with `...throwURIError()`.
Each emitted `call`/`throw` is now an independent object the shift visits exactly
once. Two-line shape, applied to both the encode and decode helpers. Not
standalone-gated, but host mode was unaffected (it adds these late imports too,
just didn't surface the same shape) and is re-verified.

### Verify-first

Sweep of `test/built-ins/{decodeURI,decodeURIComponent,encodeURI,encodeURIComponent}`
via the test262 `wrapTest` path, `--target standalone`:
- BEFORE: 92 valid / **81 invalid** (`__uri_decode`/`__uri_encode failed: call[0]
  expected type i32 …` / `throw[0] expected type externref …` / `not enough
  arguments on the stack`).
- AFTER: **173 valid / 0 invalid**; functional round-trips correct
  (decode/encode lengths, non-ASCII round-trip, catchable `URIError` on malformed
  input). `tests/issue-2868.test.ts` regression test fails on main / passes on fix.

### Residual (out of scope here) → #2878

`__str_flatten` (10) and the `test`/`inner`/`fn` user-body-shape clusters (322)
were NOT addressed by the URI-carrier fix and are tracked in **#2878** (with a
hypothesis that some may share this aliasing class, and a proposed
walker-idempotency hardening).
