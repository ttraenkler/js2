# #426 — Compound assignment on non-ref element access (11 CE)

## Problem

11 tests fail with errors about compound assignment (+=, -=, etc.) on element access expressions where the element type is not a reference type.

Example:
```javascript
arr[i] += 1;  // fails if arr[i] resolves to a non-ref type
```

The compiler attempts ref-based read-modify-write but the element is a primitive value type. Similar to #404 (compound assignment on unresolvable property type) but specific to element access.

## Priority: low (11 tests)

## Complexity: XS

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Compound assignment on array element access works for primitive types
- [ ] Reduce this CE pattern to zero
