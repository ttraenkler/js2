# #583 — Stack not empty at fallthrough in Wasm:test (82 CE) + stack-related fails

## Status: in-review
82 tests fail with `expected 0 elements on the stack for fallthru, found 2` in the `test` function. All leave exactly 2 extra values.

### Root cause
When compiling closures inside a parent function, `ctx.currentFunc` is swapped to the closure's FunctionContext. If the closure's body triggers `addUnionImports` (e.g. via `Object()` wrapper calls), the index shifting code updated already-compiled functions and the current closure, but missed the parent function's body. This left stale `call` indices pointing to wrong functions (e.g. `__unbox_number` instead of `assert_throws`), causing the Wasm validator to reject the module.

### Fix
- Added `parentBodiesStack: Instr[][]` to `CodegenContext` to track in-progress parent function bodies
- Push parent body on enter, pop on leave at all 11 nested function compilation sites (9 in expressions.ts, 2 in statements.ts)
- Shift parent bodies in both `addUnionImports` (index.ts) and `shiftLateImportIndices` (expressions.ts)

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added `parentBodiesStack` field to `CodegenContext` interface and both initialization sites
- Updated `addUnionImports` in `src/codegen/index.ts` to shift parent bodies during late import index shifting
- Updated `shiftLateImportIndices` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` similarly
- Added push/pop at all 11 `savedFunc = ctx.currentFunc` / `ctx.currentFunc = savedFunc` sites in expressions.ts (9) and statements.ts (2)
- Added test file `tests/stack-fallthrough-583.test.ts` with 7 tests

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — interface, init, addUnionImports
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — shiftLateImportIndices, 9 push/pop sites
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — 2 push/pop sites
- `tests/stack-fallthrough-583.test.ts` — new test file

### What worked
- The fix cleanly resolves the "expected 0 elements on the stack for fallthru, found 2" error for both test262 bigint-and-number.js and bigint-and-subtraction.js
- All 36 bigint equivalence tests pass, no regressions detected

### What didn't
- The test262 tests themselves still fail at runtime (return 0 instead of 1) because our compiler doesn't implement TypeError for mixed BigInt+Number arithmetic. But they no longer fail with Wasm compilation errors.

## Complexity: M
