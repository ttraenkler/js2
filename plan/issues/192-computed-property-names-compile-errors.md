# #192 — Computed property names: compile errors in class and object contexts

## Status: backlog

## Summary
68 test262 compile errors from computed property name patterns. TypeScript rejects computed property names that aren't string/number/symbol literal types in class contexts and some object contexts.

## Motivation
68 compile errors:
- 10 "A computed property name must be of type 'string', 'number', 'symbol', or 'any'" — object literals with variable computed keys
- 10 "A computed property name in a class property declaration must have a simple literal type" — class methods/properties with computed names
- Additional errors mixed with other categories

Related to but distinct from #173 (class-specific computed property names) — this covers the broader pattern including object literals.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — computed property handling
- TS configuration: may need to suppress computed property type restrictions in allowJs mode

## Complexity
M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `{ [variable]: value }` compiles when variable is a string
- [ ] 30+ test262 computed property compile errors fixed
