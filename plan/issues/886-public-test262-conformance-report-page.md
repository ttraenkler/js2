# #886 -- Public test262 conformance report page

## Problem

Conformance progress is only visible locally via the dashboard. Need a public-facing page that shows:
- Current pass rate and trend over time
- Breakdown by ES feature/category
- What works, what doesn't
- Comparison to other engines

## Requirements

1. Static HTML page (built during GitHub Pages deploy)
2. Stacked area chart showing pass/fail/CE/skip over time (reuse dashboard chart code)
3. Feature table: ES2015, ES2016, ..., ES2025 — which features pass, which don't
4. Link from README
5. Auto-updates with each test262 run (data from runs/index.json)

## Acceptance criteria

- Public page at /conformance or /test262
- Shows current pass count and historical trend
- Breaks down by ES version / feature category

## Implementation Summary

The conformance report page already existed at `public/benchmarks/report.html`. It was already part of the Vite build output and the `build-pages.js` assembly pipeline.

### What already exists
- **`public/benchmarks/report.html`**: Full conformance report with category breakdown, per-test pass/fail, test source viewer, search. Fetches data from `results/test262-results.jsonl` and `results/test262-report.json`.
- **`public/benchmarks/results/report.html`**: Historical trend chart. Fetches `runs/index.json` for time series data.
- **`scripts/build-pages.js`**: Copies all benchmark data files to `pages-dist/benchmarks/results/`.

### What was added
- README link to the conformance report page at `https://loopdive.github.io/js2wasm/benchmarks/report.html`

### Acceptance criteria check
- Public page at `/benchmarks/report.html` ✅
- Shows current pass count ✅ (from test262-report.json)
- Historical trend ✅ (from runs/index.json via trend chart at `/benchmarks/results/report.html`)
- Breakdown by category ✅ (categories from test262-results.jsonl)
- Link from README ✅
