  # 2026-09-01 (Slice B): the §27.2.1.3 settle closures gain the builtin-function
  # metadata carrier. Each grant lives in the module that already OWNS the
  # mechanism being extended, so there is no smaller home for it:
  #   async-scheduler — mints `$__promise_settle_cap`; the metadata supertype and
  #     the one `struct.new` factory the three mint sites share belong beside it.
  #   object-runtime  — owns the `__builtinfn_*` native family; the new
  #     `__builtinfn_is_builtin` is one more member, filled from the SAME
  #     finalized predicate as isExtensible/getPrototypeOf.
  #   new-super       — owns every `new`-site arm; §7.2.4 IsConstructor for a
  #     built-in function is a `new`-site refusal, not a Promise concern.

  # 2026-09-01 (Slice C): `Promise.prototype.catch`'s two-arm body and the
  # §27.2.5.4 IsPromise guard belong next to `emitPromiseProtoMemberBody`, the

  # one enumerated brand arm beside the existing Number/Boolean twins.

  # 2026-09-02 (Slice D): the NewPromiseCapability protocol is generalized in
  # place rather than forked. `promise-combinators.ts` already owns the #4682
  # capability record, its GetCapabilitiesExecutor and the construct-then-
  # validate sequence; selecting `[[Resolve]]` vs `[[Reject]]` is one field
  # index inside that same emitter. `call-namespace-static.ts` already owns the
  # `Promise.METHOD.call(C, …)` admission gate; `reject`, the one-argument
  # spelling and a zero-parameter `C` are three widenings of that one gate, and
  # splitting them into a new module would leave the gate reading half its own

# #5197 — promise r2: cluster and fix the residual promise-bucket failures

## 2026-09-13 plan refinement: retain the original resolve assignment

The R3-2 candidate's ten focused controls pass, but the unchanged original
`built-ins/Promise/all/invoke-resolve.js` still fails with zero callback calls.
An instrumented copy retaining the original module scope and assertion
harness measured `entries=0 identity=0 argc=0 this=0 calls=0`; these zero
assertion counters do not mean the assertions ran successfully. Full WAT
shows the observable combinator in `__module_init_chunk_1`, while the user
`Promise.resolve = function (...) { ... }` write is absent. The retained
native resolve therefore bypasses the intended observable callback.

The existing top-level intrinsic Promise property-write retention in
`src/codegen/declarations.ts` is inside a host-only arm. Before any change to
that file, the root reviewed open PR #5871 at head
`1ba798b5ccd17f4af877112b95b47c18de8124fc`: its three declaration-time async
signature hunks (import and function registration) are disjoint from this
module-initialization statement-retention arm. Preserve those changes during
any later normal integration; do not edit their async signature behavior.

Bounded prerequisite implementation:

1. Retain direct, unshadowed intrinsic `Promise.resolve = ...` assignments in
   standalone module initialization, in original source order. Use ordinary
   property-write lowering and the same canonical constructor carrier that
   the combinator reads. Do not enable all builtin property patches at once
   or key the decision to a Test262 filename or assertion shape.
2. Preserve host behavior and shadowed user bindings; keep unrelated builtin
   writes and the existing declaration-time async ABI out of this change.
   Prove the receiver through the TypeOracle declaration set, ignoring only an
   Identifier whose parent proves it is a property-assignment receiver (not a
   binding), and reject actual imports plus the import rewriter's generated
   `declare const Promise` binding. Record the narrow LOC/function budget
   requirement in this issue before exceeding a repository gate.
3. Add a permanent module-scope assignment/callback-observation control, not
   only a function-local analogue. Verify the emitted user write precedes
   the actual combinator call across initialization chunks and the saved
   original resolve remains callable.
4. Rerun the unchanged original and its passing control with the maintained
   isolated runner, then the strengthened protocol suite. A
   passing diagnostic cannot replace the unchanged original's verdict. Keep
   this prerequisite and its measured evidence within the R3-2 PR; do not
   claim the other Promise residual slices complete.

## 2026-09-13 continuation: observable combinator pipeline

Reopened because the documented R3-2/R3-3/R3-4 work below was not implemented;
the prior completed slices do not satisfy this issue's residual scope.
The canonical standalone baseline produced at upstream
`e0023dbbe6c37e15c1f56ed0c8bc8d15d0afbac3` contains 99 official ES2015
nonpasses under `built-ins/Promise`. Snapshot SHA-256:
`07c89a5c2626f3312ff611f008a69ed6d8826e9802da024df39726ddabc1e9ba`.
These rows include 25 `Promise_all` and 15 `Promise_race` host-import leaks;
import counts are overlapping symptoms, not independent gain claims.

The next implementation owns R3-2 only: verify current call admission, reproduce
original observable `resolve`/`then` rows and intrinsic positive controls, then
implement the documented per-element pipeline in the existing combinator
lowering. Re-derive source locations and carrier assumptions from current main.
Record an exact current path manifest and paired standalone measurements;
retain all previously passing Promise controls and run relevant equivalence
and host controls. R3-3 custom constructors and R3-4 iterator closing remain
separate follow-ups, except shared prerequisites necessary for R3-2.

Before editing, check active claims and upstream PR overlap, particularly the
native async resource and combinator-body refactors. Coordinate shared files;
do not overwrite or duplicate their implementations. Each completed fix gets
its own upstream PR and a measured issue handoff.

### R3-2 implementation decisions (2026-09-13)

The historical R3-2 design steps 2 and 4 below are superseded for this bounded
implementation. `Get(Promise, "resolve")` is emitted inline under the target
exception tag, after JavaScript argument-list evaluation but before a direct
VEC pipeline begins; a getter failure rejects the already-created aggregate.
For literals this means every element expression is first evaluated into a
local, then the one `resolve` Get occurs — compile-time instruction buffers are
not evidence of runtime evaluation order.

Each `Invoke(next, "then", handlers)` performs one `__extern_get(next,
"then")`, classifies the captured value, and calls that exact captured closure
with `next` as receiver. Do not pair a getter-based callability probe with a
second dispatcher Get: an accessor may return a different closure on its second
read. For `race`, the result capability's resolve and reject closure objects
are minted once per aggregate and reused for every element; for `all`, each
resolve-element closure remains per-element while the reject closure is shared.

Admission remains direct VEC only: externref vectors and f64 `number[]`
vectors are consumed in sequence. The latter box each slot at consumption time,
so an earlier `resolve` Call can mutate a later slot. Generic iterables,
Set/Map projection, custom constructors, and iterator closing remain outside
this slice. These boundaries and the source-wide syntactic observable gate are
admission constraints, not a claim that all 23 historical rows are closed.
The direct loop snapshots the vector's initial length. That is a known remaining
R3-2 limitation for ordinary arrays — source admission does not prove a fixed
length — rather than an unmeasured fixed-length proof. Live array-length
mutation remains follow-up ownership alongside the R3-4 generic-iterator work,
even though later-slot replacement is covered. No full R3-2 completion claim
is justified without that work and measured evidence.

For admitted `Promise.all`, the result state's remaining-elements count starts
with the iteration-completion sentinel. Each successful `Call(resolve, …)`
increments it before its `then` Invoke; the sentinel is decremented only after
the literal/direct-VEC iteration returns normally. This preserves an abrupt
`then` completion even when an earlier synchronous resolve-element callback has
already run. Native Node rejects the marker from
`{ then(ok) { ok(1); throw marker; } }`; the focused standalone control covers
that rejection and the corresponding successful one-element result vector.

Current bounded evidence on the e002 baseline is a 10/10 focused standalone
protocol suite (54.62 s, single fork): literal evaluation/Get order, one
captured resolve and call receiver/arity, contrasting and original-order
callback-arity probes, one captured `then`, abrupt Call rejection, the
remaining-elements sentinel, per-slot f64 boxing, and race handler identity.
The unchanged official `all/invoke-resolve.js` previously failed with
`callCount` 0 versus 3 and remains the acceptance row; its exact assembled
harness diagnostic is still required before claiming it fixed. A filtered WAT
compile registered the observable resolve-cap type, which proves route
registration but not the exact callback execution path.

## Problem

State after the 2026-08-29 session: wave 1 (#5143, part of PR #5179) plus a
second pass that yielded only +5 (PR #5213, added
`src/codegen/promise-newtarget.ts`). The stopped r2 planning pass has now been
completed against exact upstream `main`
`b6adee3156e9642ed221174a69e6f6f1a381484f`.

The implementation branch was rebased onto upstream `main`
`02b7a33b58362ef16c703f29d687842066beaae1` on 2026-08-30 before fanout.
The intervening upstream changes are host-init marshalling, issue metadata, and
npm-compat artifacts; they do not replace the isolated evidence below. The
implementer must rerun Slice A on the rebased head before claiming a fix.

The force-refreshed maintained artifacts supplied 152 ES2015
`built-ins/Promise/**` rows whose standalone status was not pass. Every row was
rerun in a fresh child process through `runTest262File`, with two workers and
the QuickJS eval adapter present. Fresh standalone is **12 pass / 138 fail / 2
compile_error / 0 timeout / 0 skip**. Fresh host is **75 pass / 77 fail**.

Cross-lane classification is 64 standalone-fail/host-pass, one standalone-
compile-error/host-pass, 74 fail/fail, one compile-error/host-fail, ten
pass/pass, and two standalone-pass/host-fail. The last two host regressions are
`promise.js` and `undefined-newtarget.js`; they remain explicit controls even
though the authoritative completion target is standalone.

## Implementation Plan

### Fresh residual table

| Provider surface | Rows | Fresh standalone | Fresh host | Primary invariant |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `Promise.all` | 46 | 1 pass / 45 fail | 10 pass / 36 fail | observable element pipeline and resolve-element closures |
| `Promise.race` | 35 | 1 pass / 34 fail | 11 pass / 24 fail | same element pipeline with shared capability functions |
| `Promise.prototype.then` | 16 | 1 pass / 15 fail | 11 pass / 5 fail | SpeciesConstructor and NewPromiseCapability |
| executor/resolve/reject function metadata | 15 | 0 pass / 15 fail | 13 pass / 2 fail | escaped synthesized closures must be real callable objects |
| `Promise.resolve` / `Promise.reject` | 14 | 2 pass / 12 fail | 13 pass / 1 fail | generic constructor capability and settlement identity |
| `Promise.prototype.catch` | 7 | 2 pass / 5 fail | 6 pass / 1 fail | generic `Invoke(this, "then", ...)` |
| constructor / settlement core | 6 | 2 pass / 4 fail | 5 pass / 1 fail | already-resolved guards and thenable job timing |
| `allSettled` / `any` iterator-close tail | 4 | 0 pass / 4 fail | 0 pass / 4 fail | shared abrupt-combinator iterator closing |
| arbitrary NewTarget/prototype | 3 | 1 pass / 2 CE | 1 pass / 2 fail | #3371 Reflect.construct NewTarget substrate |
| Promise prototype misc | 3 | 2 pass / 1 fail | 3 pass | canonical `@@toStringTag` |
| `Promise[Symbol.species]` | 2 | 0 pass / 2 fail | 2 pass | canonical species accessor value/descriptor |
| cross-realm prototype | 1 | 0 pass / 1 fail | 0 pass / 1 fail | realm-correct Promise prototype identity |

The two remaining compile errors are
`get-prototype-abrupt-executor-not-callable.js` (host passes) and
`get-prototype-abrupt.js` (host fails), both still refused by the documented
#3371 arbitrary-NewTarget boundary. The twelve fresh standalone passes remain
in the 152-row regression corpus; do not count them as new r2 yield.

### Implementation slices

Each completed slice is one separate mergeable upstream PR. A checkpoint that
only changes a compile error into a runtime failure is not a completed fix.

1. **Slice A — Promise symbol object model (3 rows).** Add the two
   `Promise/Symbol.species` rows and `prototype/Symbol.toStringTag.js` to
   `tests/issue-5197-es2015-promise-r2.test.ts`. Reuse the canonical builtin
   species accessor and native-prototype symbol-tag machinery; direct value
   reads and property descriptors must agree, with no Promise-specific fake
   object. Acceptance is standalone 3/3 and host 3/3.
2. **Slice B — synthesized promise callables (15-row metadata corpus).** Make
   executor, resolve, and reject functions escape as the repository's standard
   non-constructible callable carrier. They need `typeof === "function"`,
   `Function.prototype`, extensibility, own `length` then `name` descriptors,
   correct invocation arguments, and `new fn()` TypeError behavior. Apply the
   same substrate to combinator resolve-element functions rather than creating
   another representation.
3. **Slice C — generic catch/then capability.** Implement `catch` as observable
   `Invoke(this, "then", «undefined, onRejected»)` for arbitrary objects, then
   route native `$Promise.prototype.then` through ordered constructor/species
   Gets and NewPromiseCapability when those properties are observable. Keep the
   intrinsic unpatched fast path. Re-run the exact 23-row then/catch corpus,
   including its three already-passing controls.
4. **Slice D — generic Promise resolve/reject and settlement.** Generalize
   NewPromiseCapability for `Promise.resolve/reject.call(C, value)`, preserve
   constructor identity and already-resolved guards, and schedule custom
   thenables in the established microtask ring. Close the 12 static-method and
   four settlement-core failures without regressing the two host-only controls.
5. **Slice E — common observable combinator pipeline.** Build one shared
   provider for `Get(C, "resolve")` once, per-element Call, observable Get/Call
   of `then`, per-element interleaving, and IteratorClose on abrupt completion.
   It must compose the existing native thenable scheduler and the Slice-B
   callable carrier, not add host imports or drain the iterable before
   subscription.
6. **Slices F1-F3 — completed combinators separately.** Wire the common
   provider into `all`, `race`, then `allSettled`/`any`. A PR is complete only
   when its exact method corpus passes; preserve aggregate identity,
   remaining-element/once semantics, result ordering, and the method's shared
   resolve/reject function identity. Combine methods only when the same changed
   helper closes their full claimed corpora.
7. **Slice G — arbitrary NewTarget (2 rows), delegated to #3371.** Keep both
   rows in acceptance, but do not weaken Reflect.construct semantics or the
   diagnostic locally. Re-measure after #3371 supplies distinct-NewTarget
   prototype lookup and abrupt propagation.
8. **Slice H — cross-realm tail (1 row).** Close `proto-from-ctor-realm.js`
   through the canonical eval-realm Promise provider; never special-case the
   Test262 harness or treat the primary realm prototype as universal.

For every completed slice, run isolated exact host and standalone rows, the
other 152 rows as a regression sweep, already-green Promise/async controls,
TS5/TS7, zero-host-import assertions, formatting/lint, LOC/function budgets,
oracle/coercion ratchets, numeric-local parity, issue integrity, and the full
commit/pre-push hooks with at most two workers.

### Handoff

Planning/implementation worktree:
`/private/tmp/js2-es2015-promise-symbol-object-model-20260830`.
Planning/implementation branch: `codex/5197-promise-symbol-object-model`.
Exact candidate list: `/private/tmp/js2-promise-r2-baseline152.txt`.
Exact owned Slice-A list:
`/private/tmp/js2-promise-symbol-object-model3.txt`.
Fresh isolated results:
`/private/tmp/js2-promise-r2-fresh-main-{standalone,host}.jsonl`.

The implementation owner must use a separately provisioned worktree, update
this markdown issue with exact before/after evidence and remaining rows, push
checkpoints to `ttraenkler/js2` without force, and open a completed fix as a
non-draft PR on `loopdive/js2`. A semantically incomplete/non-mergeable
checkpoint may remain draft with explicit blockers. No GitHub issue is to be
created.

#### Slice A implementation checkpoint (validated in the dedicated worktree)

This worker owns exactly these three rows, as recorded in
`/private/tmp/js2-promise-symbol-object-model3.txt`:

- `test/built-ins/Promise/Symbol.species/prop-desc.js`
- `test/built-ins/Promise/Symbol.species/symbol-species.js`
- `test/built-ins/Promise/prototype/Symbol.toStringTag.js`

The provider invariant is one object model in standalone: the identity-stable
`Promise` constructor `$Object` carrier owns the `Symbol.species` accessor
entry, and both runtime reflection and the compile-time gOPD arm use the same
canonical `get [Symbol.species]` singleton (receiver-preserving, setter
`undefined`, enumerable `false`, configurable `true`). `Promise.prototype`
uses the existing native-prototype companion seeder with `symbolTag: "Promise"`
and the standard non-writable, non-enumerable, configurable descriptor. No
Promise-specific fake object or host fallback is introduced. Exact-row host
invocations are wrapped in `restoreHostBuiltins()` because the Test262
descriptor helpers destructively probe configurable properties. The shared
species closure now lives in `src/codegen/builtin-fn-meta.ts`, the neutral
metadata seam consumed by both the ctor carrier and static gOPD synthesis; this
keeps `builtin-ctor-own-props.ts` from importing `builtin-static-gopd.ts` and
avoids the `builtin-static-globals -> builtin-ctor-own-props ->
builtin-static-gopd -> property-access -> builtin-static-globals` ESM cycle.

Validation was run after integrating the exact fetched
`upstream/main` head `c243892c7f3a757bdecf6215626b08586ce72c58` in the
implementation worktree. Root transplanted the planning and implementation
commits onto a fresh publication branch and then integrated current upstream
head `3e89b5f95318b45fd69c9cf8209da84a7a06351a` without conflict.

Focused exact matrix (one Vitest fork; 8/8):

```text
PATH=/Users/thomas/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/node/bin:/Users/thomas/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/bin/fallback:$PATH \
node node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js run tests/issue-5197-es2015-promise-r2.test.ts \
  --pool=forks --poolOptions.forks.singleFork=true --no-file-parallelism --reporter=verbose
```

`3/3` exact host rows passed, `3/3` exact standalone rows passed, and the
host/standalone descriptor controls passed `2/2`. The standalone control
asserted `result.imports?.length === 0`.

The standalone 152-row regression sweep used the provisioned QuickJS artifact:

```text
JS2WASM_QUICKJS_ARTIFACT_DIR=/Users/thomas/Code/js2/.test262-cache/quickjs-artifact-2e2d7736713beeda \
node --import tsx scripts/harness-flip-probe.ts \
  --files /private/tmp/js2-promise-r2-baseline152.txt --target standalone \
  --timeout 120000 --out /private/tmp/js2-promise-r2-sliceA-after-standalone-quickjs.jsonl
```

The run completed with `15 pass / 135 fail / 2 compile_error` (`152` total;
controls `must-pass -> pass`, `must-fail -> fail`). Against
`/private/tmp/js2-promise-r2-fresh-main-standalone.jsonl` (`12 pass / 138 fail /
2 compile_error`), the partition is `149 unchanged`, exactly three
fail-to-pass rows (the three owned rows above), `0 pass-to-fail`, and `0 other
status changes`.

The ordinary host sweep initially aborted after row 9 because
`harness-flip-probe.ts` does not install an unhandled-rejection handler; the
row itself returned `fail`, then the process exited on `TypeError: undefined is
not a function`. The same authentic 152-row run was completed with a
process-level observer that only swallowed those existing unhandled rejections
(no repository file change): `75 pass / 77 fail`, `152` total. Compared with
`/private/tmp/js2-promise-r2-fresh-main-host.jsonl` (`75 pass / 77 fail`), all
`152` statuses were unchanged (`0` flips in either direction). This runner
limitation is the only corpus measurement blocker.

Additional one-worker controls:

- `tests/issue-4167-test262.test.ts tests/reflected-symbol-promise-statics.test.ts tests/promise-expando-standalone.test.ts`: `12/12` passed.
- `tests/issue-3765-numeric-locals.test.ts`: `18/18` passed.
- `tests/issue-2984-species.test.ts tests/issue-2984-ctor-carrier-own-props.test.ts tests/issue-4746.test.ts tests/issue-3319.test.ts tests/issue-5116-map-set-prototype-tostringtag.test.ts`: `51/52` passed. The sole failure is the test's explicitly labeled pre-existing `KNOWN GAP (pre-existing): a dynamic write bypasses the non-writable flag`; all 51 other controls, including both #4746 Promise-order rows and all #5116 Map/Set tag rows, passed.

Quality evidence (all completed without history mutation): TS5 and TS7 direct
typechecks passed; full Prettier check passed; full Biome lint exited 0;
host-import policy reported `legacySemanticImports=0` and `unknownImports=0`;
oracle/coercion ratchets reported no net growth; stack-balance buckets had
zero deltas; codegen-fallback, any-box, speculative-rollback, IR dialect,
IR-kind-neutrality, IR-layering, and issue-integrity/ID checks passed. The
issue checker reports only its existing ready-issue probe warnings and no
changed done-status violation.

Slice-A completion: the three owned rows are green in both lanes, with no
standalone regression in the 152-row comparison. The host runner limitation
and unrelated #2984 known-gap failure remain explicit follow-up notes. No
GitHub issue was created.

#### Slice A publication handoff (2026-08-30)

The single completed-fix PR is
<https://github.com/loopdive/js2/pull/5292>. It is a non-draft PR from
`ttraenkler:codex/5197-promise-symbol-object-model-final` to
`loopdive/js2:main`; no GitHub issue was created. Its description uses the
repository's exact Description and CLA sections and links this markdown issue.
A dedicated Luna Max PR shepherd owns exact-head, body, readiness, conflict,
review, CI, and queue verification.

The publication branch is
`/private/tmp/js2-promise-symbol-pr-20260830`. Implementation commit
`fd13172095d3773627433bba0d4c0e2648ab6e93` has the same tree as the fully
validated implementation worktree. Integration commit
`d469014322b88d5c01d45d728177086f86fdb498` adds only the newly merged upstream
history; a post-integration focused rerun passed 8/8 and the complete pre-push
hook passed without bypasses. This documentation-only handoff does not alter
the validated Promise behavior.

## Acceptance criteria

- All 152 exact rows pass standalone with zero host imports; interim PRs pass
  every row they claim and do not lose any previously passing row.
- The 75 currently passing host controls remain green. The two host-only
  regressions are restored by the shared provider work that owns their
  invariant, not hidden from the corpus.
- Both compile errors become passes after #3371 lands, never merely runtime
  failures.
- Exact isolated sweeps, focused tests, async/equivalence controls, ratchets,
  issue integrity, and complete repository hooks are green for every fix.

## 2026-09-01 r2 Slices B–D implementation (Opus)

### Corpus and baseline

Exact corpus: the 140 ES2015 `built-ins/Promise/**` rows that were not passing
standalone at sha `d39779cb` (`.tmp/es2015/promise-paths.txt`). Measured on this
branch's base with `npx tsx scripts/run-test262-paths.mts … --standalone`:

| | pass | fail | compile_error |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| before (140 rows) | 0 | 134 | 6 |
| after Slices B + C | **11** | 127 | 2 |

Set-differencing the two non-pass lists: **11 rows flipped fail → pass, 0 rows
regressed**. Because nothing in the corpus passed at baseline, no row inside it
*could* regress; regression cover for everything OUTSIDE the corpus is the
focused vitest file plus the equivalence gate.

The two surviving compile errors are the pair the plan already assigns to Slice
G — `get-prototype-abrupt.js` and `get-prototype-abrupt-executor-not-callable.js`,
both refused by the documented #3371 arbitrary-NewTarget boundary. They are the
only two of the six that were real compiler refusals.

Three environment notes that change how the numbers read:

- The other **four** baseline `compile_error`s were **compilation timeouts**
  (~16 s each) under a 4-core box shared with five other agents, not compiler
  refusals: `{resolve,reject,executor}-function-prototype.js` and
  `then/S25.4.5.3_A1.1_T2.js`. Two of those four are among the eleven rows that
  now pass; the other two are ordinary failures in the after-run.
- `proto-from-ctor-realm.js` and the two `*-function-prototype.js` rows need the
  prebuilt QuickJS runtime-eval provider. Its adapter cache key changes with the
  compiler bundle, so it had to be rebuilt
  (`node --import tsx scripts/build-quickjs-eval-provider.mjs`, ~14 s) before
  those rows could be scored at all.
- **The in-process probe does NOT apply the standalone host-import leak check
  CI's sharded lane applies** (#5272) — `runTest262File`'s original-harness path
  bypasses `standaloneHostImportError`. Every row claimed below was therefore
  re-checked by compiling its exact original-harness module with
  `target: "standalone"` and asserting `result.imports` is empty.

### Slice B — synthesized promise callables (LANDED)

`$__promise_settle_cap` now subtypes the repository's builtin-function metadata
type (`ensureBuiltinFnMetaType`, `{name: "", length: 1}`) instead of the bare
signature wrapper, so the finalize-time arms that already answer
`name`/`length`/gOPD/delete/`getOwnPropertyNames` and
isExtensible/isFrozen/isSealed/`getPrototypeOf` cover the escaped `resolve` /
`reject` for free. One factory (`buildPromiseSettleClosureInstrs`) owns the
`struct.new` operand order for all three mint sites; the capture index moved
from 3 to 5 and is carried as `capPromiseFieldIdx`, never a literal.

§7.2.4 IsConstructor at a dynamic `new` site: a new `__builtinfn_is_builtin`
native, filled from the SAME finalized predicate as the integrity helpers, lets
the two standalone unknown-ctor bases throw the spec TypeError for a built-in
function value.

**+6 rows** (all fail → pass, all host-import clean):
`{resolve,reject}-function-name.js`,
`{resolve,reject}-function-property-order.js`,
`{resolve,reject}-function-prototype.js`.

### Slice C — generic `catch`, brand-checked `then` (LANDED, partial)

`Promise.prototype.catch` is §27.2.5.1 `Invoke(this, "then", «undefined,
onRejected»)` and nothing more. Its body now `ref.test`s the receiver: a native
`$Promise` keeps the intrinsic fast path verbatim, anything else goes through
`__call_m_then_vararg` — the same dispatcher the thenable-assimilation job uses
— with an `__promise_has_callable_then` pre-check supplying the §7.3.14 step-2
TypeError the dispatcher does not raise. `Promise.prototype.then` gained the
§27.2.5.4 step-2 IsPromise guard, which it needs before it can be reached
reflectively at all (its `ref.cast` previously trapped on a foreign `this`).

`nativeProtoBrandForInterface` learned the `Promise` brand. Without it the
DIRECT syntactic spelling `Promise.prototype.catch.call(target, f)` fell to the
legacy `.call` tail, which drops `thisArg` — so the object's own `then` was
never invoked. The value-erased spelling (`var m = Promise.prototype.catch`)
already worked; that difference is why a hand-probe passed while the test262
rows did not.

**+5 rows**: `catch/{invokes-then,this-value-then-not-callable,
this-value-then-throws,this-value-then-poisoned}.js`,
`then/context-check-on-entry.js`.

### Slice D — NOT done, and what it needs

Slice D was not attempted, on evidence rather than time alone: every one of its
rows bottoms out in the same missing mechanism, a generic
**NewPromiseCapability(C)** — mint a GetCapabilitiesExecutor built-in function
(the Slice-B carrier is the right one), `Construct(C, «executor»)` for an
arbitrary runtime `C`, then apply steps 8–9's IsCallable checks to whatever the
executor stored. Two concrete gaps block it:

1. `Promise.resolve` / `Promise.reject` reify with `paramTypes = [externref]`
   and **no receiver slot** (`ensureStandaloneBuiltinStaticMethodClosure`), so
   `Promise.resolve.call(C, v)` cannot see `C` at all.
2. Standalone has no general "construct this runtime closure value" primitive —
   the `new`-site arms cover `$__ta_ctor`, bound functions and runtime-eval
   carriers, and the host lane's `__construct_closure` is not available.

The six `executor-function-*` rows in the Slice-B corpus are Slice-D-blocked for
the same reason: they reach GetCapabilitiesExecutor only via
`Promise.resolve.call(NotPromise)`.

### Rows deliberately not fixed

| row(s) | why |
| --- | --- |
| `exec-args.js`, `{resolve,reject}-function-nonconstructor.js` | fail EARLIER than any of this work, in the harness-level `var` binding: the receiver reads null before `hasOwnProperty` is consulted. Same error text as baseline. A hand-written probe of the identical shape passes in both lanes, so the defect is in how the original-harness module binds that `var`, not in the settle-closure object model. |
| `catch/this-value-obj-coercible.js` | needs §7.3.2 GetV's `ToObject` step for a PRIMITIVE receiver (`Boolean.prototype.then`), a separate mechanism from the generic Invoke. |
| `catch/S25.4.5.1_A2.1_T1.js`, `then/S25.4.5.3_A1.1_T2.js` | `p.then` / `p.catch` read off a native `$Promise` INSTANCE answer `undefined` — the prototype-chain member read from a `$Promise` receiver is not wired (only `Promise.prototype.<m>` is). Independent of Slice C. |
| `then/ctor-*`, `then/*-prms-cstm-then.js`, `then/capability-*` | SpeciesConstructor + NewPromiseCapability — Slice D/C's `then` half. |
| Slice E/F combinators (`all`/`race`/`allSettled`/`any`, 83 rows) | out of scope for this pass; still leak `env::Promise_all` / `Promise_race` / `__js_array_new`. |
| Slice G (#3371 NewTarget), Slice H (realm) | out of scope by the plan. |

## 2026-09-01 resumed implementation (Opus)

Resumes the suspension handoff below (patches applied with `git am --3way` onto
`813b828b6`; the only conflict was this file's own References block, resolved by
keeping both sides). Slice C was committed properly; Slice D was then
implemented and measured. Worktree
`/home/user/js2/.claude/worktrees/agent-adaa0534580f31c70`, branch
`worktree-agent-adaa0534580f31c70`.

### Slice C — committed as landed (no code change)

The suspended snapshot's uncommitted Slice C edits were validated as a commit
rather than re-derived: TS7 typecheck clean; both focused files green
(`issue-5197-es2015-promise-r2.test.ts` 8/8, `issue-5197-promise-generic-catch.test.ts`
4/4, run one file per fork); all five ratchet gates exit 0
(loc, func, coercion, oracle-ratchet "no net checker-usage growth", dead-exports
"25 known entries, 0 new"). Commit `6fe2aad08`.

The pre-existing TS5 failure `src/linked-provider-runtime.ts(41,37) TS2694:
Namespace 'WebAssembly' has no exported member 'Tag'` is **not** from this work —
that file is untouched by every patch in this lane (`git diff 813b828b6 --stat --
src/linked-provider-runtime.ts` is empty). TS7 is clean.

### Slice D — generic NewPromiseCapability(C) (LANDED, partial)

The two gaps the previous implementer named were real but narrower than the
"no receiver slot / no generic Construct" framing suggested. The blocker was
**not** the reified `Promise.resolve` closure's missing receiver: a syntactic
`Promise.resolve.call(C, v)` never reaches that closure at all — it is decided
by `compileNamespaceStaticCall`, which already had a #4682/#4727
NewPromiseCapability arm (`emitStandalonePromiseCustom{CapabilityCheck,Resolve}`
in `promise-combinators.ts`: mint the capability record, mint a
GetCapabilitiesExecutor on the funcref-wrapper carrier, call `C`, apply
§27.2.1.5 steps 8-9, then `Call` the resolve slot). That arm was simply admitted
too narrowly. Three widenings, no second protocol:

1. **`reject` joins `resolve`.** §27.2.4.6 and §27.2.4.7 differ only in which
   capability slot the value is handed to, so the emitter takes a
   `settle: "resolve" | "reject"` argument and picks field 0 or 1 of the same
   record. It is now `emitStandalonePromiseCustomSettle`.
2. **One argument is admitted** (`Promise.resolve.call(C)`), not just two. The
   protocol reads only `C`; the settled value is `undefined`.
3. **A zero-parameter `C` is admitted.** The executor then never reaches a
   formal, both slots stay undefined, and steps 8-9 throw the TypeError the spec
   requires — which is the whole point of `reject/S25.4.4.4_A3.1_T1.js`.

**The undefined-vs-null trap (#2864), caught by the control, not by the corpus.**
The absent second argument was first emitted as `ref.null.extern`. Every exact
row still passed and the host lane passed, because none of them inspects the
settled value — but in standalone a null externref IS JS `null`, not
`undefined`, so `Promise.resolve.call(C)` settled with the wrong value. The fix
is `canonicalUndefinedExternInstrs`, resolved BEFORE the value side-buffer is
detached (it reserves the `$AnyValue` substrate on first use, and doing that with
`fctx.body` swapped away would register under a body already being written).

**Measurement** — the WHOLE 140-row corpus, standalone, in process, base =
Slice C commit `6fe2aad08` (file-copy A/B; both runs executed by this
implementer, ~10 min each):

| | pass | fail | compile_error |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| before (Slices B + C) | 11 | 127 | 2 |
| after Slice D | **19** | 119 | 2 |

Set-differenced: **8 fail → pass, 0 regressions.** The `before` figure
reproduces the previous implementer's 11/127/2 exactly, which also confirms the
two surviving compile errors are still only the #3371 pair. All eight rows were
re-compiled through `wrapTest` + `compile({target:"standalone"})` and checked
with the runner's own `standaloneHostImportError`: every one reports an empty
import list, so no row is claimed on a module that still leaks
`env::Promise_resolve` / `Promise_reject` (#5272 — the in-process probe does not
apply that check itself).

- `built-ins/Promise/resolve/capability-invocation-error.js`
- `built-ins/Promise/resolve/ctx-ctor-throws.js`
- `built-ins/Promise/reject/capability-invocation-error.js`
- `built-ins/Promise/reject/ctx-ctor-throws.js`
- `built-ins/Promise/reject/capability-executor-not-callable.js`
- `built-ins/Promise/reject/S25.4.4.4_A3.1_T1.js`
- `built-ins/Promise/executor-function-extensible.js`
- `built-ins/Promise/executor-function-length.js`

The last two were **not** predicted from the 17-row resolve/reject/settlement
sub-corpus (which moved 0 → 6) and are the reason the full sweep was worth its
ten minutes. They are downstream of the same admission: both observe the
GetCapabilitiesExecutor's own `length` / extensibility, and the only way either
reaches one is `Promise.resolve.call(NotPromise)` — a ONE-argument call on a
custom `C`. Slice B had already made that executor a real built-in function
object; Slice D is what lets the rows reach it. That closes two of the six
`executor-function-*` rows the previous implementer listed as Slice-D-blocked.

**A file-copy A/B pitfall worth naming**, because it silently reverted a fix
that had already been validated. The revert copies were captured at the FIRST
edit (per the CLAUDE.md pattern) and then the `undefined` fix landed on top —
so `.tmp/new.ts` was stale. Restoring from it after the base measurement put a
tree back that was *not* the tree the measurement had been taken on, and the
only thing that caught it was the compiled control returning 5 again. **Refresh
the "new" copy after every edit that follows it, and re-run the focused control
after any restore** — a restore is a code change, not a bookkeeping step.

One measurement artifact worth recording: in the first after-run
`resolve/capability-executor-called-twice.js` scored `compile_error
(compilation timeout, 15445 ms)` at box load ~13 on 4 cores. Re-run alone it is
`fail`, the same status it had at baseline — a load artifact, not a regression.
Any single-row `compile_error` in this corpus should be re-run alone before it
is believed.

### Slice D — what is still open

| row(s) | why |
| --- | --- |
| `{resolve,reject}/capability-executor-called-twice.js` | the arm IS taken, and both throw the capability TypeError: after `executor()` / `executor(undefined, undefined)` the follow-up `executor(fn, fn)` does not leave two callables in the record, so steps 8-9 refuse. The GetCapabilitiesExecutor is reached through the dynamic apply path with a 0-argument call; that padding/store interaction is the next thing to look at. |
| `{resolve,reject}/ctx-ctor.js` | `class SubPromise extends Promise` — needs a real `Construct(C, «executor»)` with subclass prototype and `instance.constructor`, not the plain call this arm performs. |
| `reject/capability-invocation.js`, `resolve/resolve-from-promise-capability.js` | need the settle call's `this` (sloppy-mode global) and a real `arguments` object inside the user-supplied resolve/reject function. |
| `resolve/arg-uniq-ctor.js` | §27.2.4.7 step 3 — `Promise.resolve(x)` must `Get(x, "constructor")` and compare with `C` before the passthrough; today a native `$Promise` is returned unchanged without that read. Self-contained and reachable, just not done here. |
| `exception-after-resolve-in-{executor,thenable-job}.js`, `resolve-prms-cstm-then-{immed,deferred}.js` | settlement-core rows that fail in the async drive, unrelated to the capability protocol. |
| Slices E/F (combinators), G (#3371), H (realm) | untouched by this pass. |

### Validation for both commits

| check | result |
| --- | --- |
| TS7 `pnpm run typecheck` | clean |
| TS5 `pnpm run typecheck:ts5` | one PRE-EXISTING error in `src/linked-provider-runtime.ts` (`WebAssembly.Tag`); that file is untouched by this lane |
| `tests/issue-5197-es2015-promise-r2.test.ts` | 8/8 |
| `tests/issue-5197-promise-generic-catch.test.ts` | 4/4 |
| `tests/issue-5197-promise-generic-capability.test.ts` | 10/10 |
| loc / func / coercion / oracle-ratchet / dead-exports | all exit 0 |
| prettier + biome on every changed file | clean |
| `pnpm run test:equivalence:gate` | **24 failing, 1718 passing, 24 known-failures in baseline — no new regressions** |
| `npm run check:issues`, `check:done-status-integrity` | exit 0 |

**On the equivalence gate's scope.** The green run above was taken on the
Slice C + Slice D tree before the `undefined` fix; a re-run on the exact
committed tree was killed by the harness at ~55 min under box load 12-14 and
produced no verdict. That gap is closed by inspection rather than by a third
run: `grep -rn "resolve\.call\|reject\.call" tests/equivalence/` returns **zero
matches**, so no equivalence test can reach the changed arm at all, in either
version. The suite is byte-identical across the whole of Slice D; the green run
is therefore evidence for the committed tree, and specifically for Slice C.

**Two control failures were checked and are PRE-EXISTING, not this lane's.**
Both were A/B'd by restoring all eight lane-modified `src/codegen` files to
`813b828b6` and re-running:

- `tests/issue-2671-promise-capability.test.ts` — "wasm thenable element's then
  is invoked with the native resolve-element fn": `'C.resolve|'` vs
  `'C.resolve|p1.then:function|'`, identical at base. (The other 30 tests across
  `promise-combinators`, `issue-2671-promise-executor` and
  `issue-28-promise-executor-invocation` pass, including both
  `Promise.reject.call(NotPromise)` executor-metadata rows.)
- `tests/reflected-symbol-promise-statics.test.ts` — BOTH tests fail, including
  the `Symbol.for`/`Symbol.keyFor` one that this lane cannot touch; identical at
  base. Worth a look by whoever owns it: the previous implementer recorded this
  file green on 2026-09-01, so something between then and `813b828b6` (or an
  environment difference) took it out.

`promise-expando-standalone`, `issue-4167-async-rejection-identity`,
`issue-2623-promise-subclass-identity` and `issue-2867-gap4` are all green
(45 passing in that batch).

A pointer for whoever takes Slice E/F: `all/` and `race/` carry the exact twins
of the rows just fixed — `{all,race}/ctx-ctor{,-throws}.js`,
`{all,race}/capability-executor-{called-twice,not-callable}.js`. They fail for a
different reason (the `.call(C, iter)` arm still admits only an EMPTY array via
`emitStandalonePromiseCustomCapabilityCheck`, and a non-empty iterable needs the
per-element pipeline), so the same widening does not simply transfer — but the
capability half of their work is now done and shared.

## Suspended Work (2026-09-01T21:56Z — user-requested 2-hour pause)

- **Branch**: local lane branch `worktree-agent-ac8409dd2ee533f14` at `df3746897`
  (WIP snapshot on top of base `d153a0882`; NOT pushed — durable copy is
  `plan/agent-context/es2015-suspend-2026-09-01/patches/lane-5197.mbox`, 2
  patches: Slice B commit `772cd49e8` + the snapshot carrying the uncommitted
  Slice C edits in `array-object-proto.ts`, `expressions/calls.ts`,
  `tests/issue-5197-es2015-promise-r2.test.ts`, new
  `tests/issue-5197-promise-generic-catch.test.ts`, and the issue-file section
  `## 2026-09-01 r2 Slices B–D implementation (Opus)`).
- **Worktree at suspension**: `/home/user/js2/.claude/worktrees/agent-ac8409dd2ee533f14`
  (treat as gone).
- **State**: Slice B LANDED (committed, validated); Slice C landed PARTIAL
  (uncommitted in the snapshot — validated per the implementer's notes but not
  gate-run as a commit); Slice D NOT attempted (every row needs a generic
  NewPromiseCapability(C): mint a GetCapabilitiesExecutor built-in function
  on the Slice-B carrier, `Construct(C, «executor»)` for an arbitrary runtime
  `C`, then the §27.2.1.5 steps 8–9 IsCallable checks — see the implementer's
  section for the two concrete gaps).
- **Verified so far** (implementer's runs, 140-row corpus, standalone,
  in-process): before 0 pass / 134 fail / 6 CE → after B + C **11 pass / 127
  fail / 2 CE (+11, 0 regressions)**; every claimed row re-checked for an empty
  standalone import list. Slice B +6 (`{resolve,reject}-function-{name,property-order,prototype}.js`),
  Slice C +5 (`catch/{invokes-then,this-value-then-not-callable,this-value-then-throws,this-value-then-poisoned}.js`,
  `then/context-check-on-entry.js`). The two surviving CEs are the #3371 pair.
  Four baseline "CEs" were load-induced compile timeouts; three rows need the
  QuickJS provider rebuilt for the current bundle
  (`node --import tsx scripts/build-quickjs-eval-provider.mjs`, ~14 s).
- **NOT yet verified / next steps**: (1) `pnpm run typecheck` + focused vitest
  files on the applied patch; (2) five ratchet gates + `pnpm run
  test:equivalence:gate` for Slice C; (3) commit Slice C properly; (4) Slice D
  per the gaps above; (5) Slices E/F combinators (the `env::Promise_all`/
  `Promise_race`/`__js_array_new` leaks, 33 rows).
- **Traps**: `nativeProtoBrandForInterface` needed the `Promise` brand — without
  it the direct spelling `Promise.prototype.catch.call(t, f)` fell to the legacy
  `.call` tail that drops `thisArg`; a hand-probe with the value-erased spelling
  passed while test262 did not. Merge, never rebase.

## Implementation Plan — r3 (2026-09-03)

Base for every line number below: upstream `main` `bee5ddd535` (the census
sha; HEAD `9c23347f57` adds only docs commits, `src/` is identical). Census:
118 non-pass ES2015 rows in `.tmp/census0903/promise.tsv` — 50
`compile_error` (all but 4 are `host_import_leak`), 68 `fail`, 0 timeout.
Previous plan slices E–H map onto R3-2/R3-3/R3-4 (E, F1, F2), the deferred
block (G, H); F3 (`allSettled`/`any`) has only the 4 class-`C` rows left and is
deferred with them.

### Root-cause groups (118 rows, by mechanism — not by path)

| # | Root cause (one defect each) | Rows | Step |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| G1 | The native combinators never do the observable `Get(C, "resolve")` / per-element `Call(resolve, C, v)` / `Invoke(next, "then", …)` — `Promise.resolve = f`, `defineProperty(Promise, "resolve", {get})` and an own `then` on a native element are all ignored. Includes the 4 `number[]`-argument rows that still leak `env::Promise_all` (the documented f64-vec gap). | 29 | R3-2 (23), R3-4 (6 `-close` rows) |
| G2 | `Promise.all/race.call(C, iterable)` is admitted ONLY for `function C(){…}` declarations + an EMPTY `[]` (call-namespace-static.ts L2411-L2470); every other shape leaks `env::Promise_all`/`Promise_race` + `__js_array_new`. | 28 | R3-3 (27), R3-4 (1) |
| G3 | Iterator abrupt completion / `IteratorClose` — the argument is drained to a vec BEFORE any element work, so `return()` is never called and a throwing `next()` surfaces as "argument is not iterable". | 6 (+1 in G2) | R3-4 (conditional — see the probe) |
| G4 | `$__promise_custom_capability_executor` treats the canonical `undefined` singleton as "stored" (`ref.is_null` guard, promise-combinators.ts L186-L194), so `executor()` / `executor(undefined, undefined)` followed by `executor(f, g)` throws. | 4 | R3-1 |
| G5 | `__promise_resolve_value` short-circuits on `ref.test $Promise` (async-scheduler.ts L1648-L1650) and never consults an own `then` written onto a native promise; the thenable job also re-reads `then` at job time instead of using the value captured at Resolve time. | 7 | R3-5 |
| G6 | `then` never reads `constructor` / `@@species`; `Promise.resolve(x)` never reads `x.constructor`. | 5 (+2 subclass rows in G9) | R3-6 |
| G7 | `p.then` / `p.catch` read as a VALUE off a `$Promise` instance answers `undefined` (probe C below). | 2 | R3-7 |
| G8 | `.then` handler returning a `boolean` is boxed as a NUMBER (`coerceStackValueToExternref` L1828-L1835 ignores the i32 `boolean` brand). | 2 | R3-8 |
| G9 | `class X extends Promise` used as `C` — standalone has no `Construct(C, «executor»)` for a compiled class and the host `__promise_subclass_ctor` leaks; 2 of these are the invalid-binary CEs. | 10 | DEFERRED |
| G10 | `class C { static resolve(){throw} }` as `C` (needs G9's class construct) — the 8 `resolve-throws-iterator-return-*` rows across all four combinators. | 8 | DEFERRED |

All 15 reproduce the baseline status AND error string; nothing in the sample has
been fixed by the merges since 09:07 UTC. Every group above has at least one
member in the sample except G8/G9/G11/G12 (whose error strings are
distinctive enough to trust).

Mechanism probes (`.tmp/p5197r3/probe-carrier.mts`, three small standalone
programs, `imports=[]` for all three):

| probe | program | result | what it proves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | `Promise.resolve = mine; Promise.resolve === mine; Promise.resolve(5) === 42` | `101` | the assignment lands on the `$Object` ctor carrier (`__builtin_ctor_Promise`, builtin-static-globals.ts L172) and a later `Promise.resolve(5)` CALL already dispatches to it — only the combinators ignore it |
| B | `Object.defineProperty(Promise,'resolve',{get(){n++; return f}})`, two reads | `23` (2 gets, both return `f`) | accessor defines on the carrier work; `__extern_get(carrier, "resolve")` runs the getter |
| C | `p.constructor = null; p.constructor === null` / `typeof Promise.resolve(2).then === "function"` | `1` (+0) | the `$Promise` bag round-trips `constructor` (R3-6 can read it); the instance member VALUE read of `then` is not a function (G7) |

### Shared design constraints (apply to every step)

- **Type info via `ctx.oracle` only** (`valueDeclarationOf`, `typeFactOf`,
  `signatureOf`); no `ctx.checker.getTypeAtLocation` — the oracle-ratchet gate
  fails otherwise. The only checker call already present in the touched region
  (call-namespace-static.ts L2095, Set/Map probe) stays as it is.
- **No new host import, anywhere.** Every arm is standalone-native
  (`isStandalonePromiseActive`), and the host/gc lane must stay byte-identical:
  the acceptance for every step includes a host-lane compile of the named
  control programs and a `result.binary` byte comparison against the base tree.
- **Registration-before-bake** (#2918/#2919): every `ensure*`/`reserve*` call
  a step adds runs BEFORE any `ref.func`/`call` operand is pushed into a
  detached buffer; and keep `fctx.savedBodies`/`ctx.liveBodies` discipline
  exactly as the existing arms do (see the comment block at
  call-namespace-static.ts L2056-L2068).
- **`undefined` is not `ref.null.extern`** (#2864): any value that is
  semantically `undefined` is `canonicalUndefinedExternInstrs(ctx)`
  (any-helpers.ts L167), resolved BEFORE the body is swapped to a side buffer.
- **`FunctionContext` literals** carry `labelMap: new Map()` and
  `isGenerator?: boolean`; none of the steps should need a new one, but if a
  helper function is minted through a fresh `FunctionContext`, include both.
- **Every new callable that escapes to user code** (resolve-element functions,
  GetCapabilitiesExecutor) is a subtype of the builtin-fn metadata carrier
  (`ensureBuiltinFnMetaType`, builtin-fn-meta.ts L261) exactly like
  `$__promise_settle_cap` (async-scheduler.ts L1044-L1075), never a second
  representation.
- **Probe command** for every row claim:
  `npx tsx scripts/run-test262-paths.mts <list> --standalone` (≤15 paths per
  batch, `--isolate` on a hang). Any single-row `compile_error (compilation
  timeout …)` is re-run alone before it is believed. The in-process runner now
  applies the host-import leak check (#5461); a row is claimed only when its
  status is `pass`.

### Steps, in execution order

#### R3-1 — capability executor: `undefined` is "not yet stored" (4 rows, S, low risk)

**Root cause.** `__promise_custom_capability_executor` (promise-combinators.ts
L183-L215) decides "a slot was already stored" with `ref.is_null` on fields 0/1
of `$__promise_custom_capability`. `executor(undefined, undefined)` and the
zero-argument `executor()` (padded by `__apply_closure`) store the canonical
`$AnyValue` `undefined` singleton, which is a NON-null externref, so the
spec-legal second call `executor(f, g)` throws the TypeError meant for
`(undefined, function)`.

**Edits.**
1. In `ensureCustomCapabilityRuntime` replace the two `ref.is_null` / `i32.eqz`
   pairs (L186-L194) by "slot is nullish": `ref.is_null` OR the flagged
   is-undefined predicate. Use the existing native the object runtime already
   fills from `buildIsUndefinedExternBody` (any-helpers.ts, callers at
   object-runtime.ts L2709 / L6404 and registry/imports.ts L1823 — read those
   three to pick the registered `(externref) -> i32` name and call it; do NOT
   inline a second copy of the predicate). If that native is not registered in
   the module, fall back to `ref.is_null` (today's behaviour).
2. The post-construction validation in `emitStandalonePromiseCustomCapabilityCheck`
   (L311-L322) and `emitStandalonePromiseCustomSettle` (L410-L426) already
   uses `ref.test wrapperRoot` (a stored `undefined` fails it) — unchanged.

**Rows (4).** `built-ins/Promise/{all,race,resolve,reject}/capability-executor-called-twice.js`.
Growth: promise-combinators.ts +15, no function crosses 300.

**Order constraint.** The executor still stores BOTH arguments on every
admitted call (spec GetCapabilitiesExecutor step 5-6 store, not merge).

**Acceptance.** (a) the 4 rows `pass`; (b) PASSING shapes at risk — the six
`capability-executor-not-callable` subcases (`tests/issue-4682.test.ts` "passes
the six …" and `tests/issue-5197-promise-generic-capability.test.ts` 10/10) must
still throw for `(undefined, function)` / `(function, undefined)` / a
non-callable pair — run both files; (c) `reject/capability-executor-not-callable.js`,
`reject/S25.4.4.4_A3.1_T1.js` (Slice-D rows) re-probed `pass`; (d) host lane:
`tests/issue-4682.test.ts` "keeps the gc/host custom-constructor path unchanged"
green.

#### R3-2 — observable `resolve`/`then` pipeline on the intrinsic receiver over VEC arguments (23 rows, L, medium risk)

**Root cause.** `emitStandalonePromiseCombinator` (L1199) and
`emitStandalonePromiseCombinatorRuntime` (L1345) feed every element straight to
`__combinator_subscribe` (L749), which normalizes through `__promise_resolve_value`
and attaches raw microtask reaction FUNCS. Spec §27.2.4.1.1/§27.2.4.3.1 requires,
per call: (1) `promiseResolve = Get(C, "resolve")` ONCE, before GetIterator,
TypeError if not callable — IfAbruptRejectPromise; (2) per element
`nextPromise = Call(promiseResolve, C, «value»)`; (3)
`Invoke(nextPromise, "then", «resolveElement, capability.[[Reject]]»)` where
`resolveElement` is a real built-in function object (`length` 1, `name` "",
`[[AlreadyCalled]]`). Today `Promise.resolve = f` / a getter on the carrier /
an own `then` on a native element promise are invisible, and an f64-backed
`number[]` argument still falls through to the `env::Promise_all` host import
(`resolveExternrefVecArg` L1297 returns null for f64 vecs; call-namespace-static.ts
L2151-L2169).

**Design — one generic step function, a fast path that stays byte-identical.**

1. **Compile-time gate `promiseResolveObservable(ctx, node)`** (new, in
   promise-combinators.ts, cached per source file like
   `sourceHasMethodReassignment` at calls.ts L3131): true iff the source file
   contains (a) an assignment whose LHS is `<X>.resolve` (reuse
   `sourceHasMethodReassignment(ctx, node, "resolve")`), or (b) a call
   `Object.defineProperty(<X>, "resolve"|…)` / `Object.defineProperties(<X>, …)`
   whose first argument is the identifier `Promise`, or (c) any `.then` /
   `"then"` assignment or defineProperty target (`sourceHasMethodReassignment(…, "then")`
   plus the defineProperty scan). When FALSE the existing emitters run
   unchanged — this is the byte-identity guarantee for every module that never
   touches those properties (all of `tests/promise-combinators.test.ts`,
   `deno-safe-promise-combinators.test.ts`, the async equivalence corpus).
2. **`__combinator_get_resolve(C) -> externref`** (new defined func, registered
   by `ensureCombinatorFunctions` only when the gate is true): `__extern_get(C,
   "resolve")` on the carrier (`emitBuiltinConstructorIdentity(ctx, fctx,
   "Promise")` pushes the carrier; getters run inside `__extern_get`), then
   IsCallable via `buildClosureRefTestArms` (closed-method-dispatch.ts, the
   #2175 classifier) → TypeError (`emitWasiErrorConstructor(ctx,"TypeError",1)`,
   `__new_TypeError`) when not callable. The emit site wraps the call in
   `buildTargetTaggedTry` and on catch rejects the result promise
   (`rt.rejectFuncIdx`) and SKIPS the element loop — this is what
   `invoke-resolve-get-error.js` observes (Get happens BEFORE GetIterator, so
   emit it before the `__combinator_to_vec` call in `emitDynamicCombinatorArg`,
   calls.ts L10480, and before the element buffers are spliced in the literal
   arm).
3. **Intrinsic fast path check.** Compare the fetched value with the intrinsic
   singleton (`ensureStandaloneBuiltinStaticMethodClosure(ctx, "Promise",
   "resolve")` + `pushBuiltinFnSingletonValueInstrs`, `ref.eq` after
   `any.convert_extern`). Identical ⇒ the existing `__combinator_subscribe`
   path (unchanged bytes, unchanged microtask count). Different ⇒ the generic
   element step below.
4. **`__combinator_element_step(next, state, index, C, fulfillFn, rejectFn)`**
   (new, `buildCombinatorElementStep`): `next = __apply_closure(resolveFn, C,
   [value])` is done by the CALLER (so the loop can catch and reject); this
   helper implements `Invoke(next, "then", «resolveElem, rejectElem»)`:
   - mint the two element functions as REAL closures (see 5) into an objvec
     (`ensureObjVecBuilders`), then
   - if `next` is a native `$Promise` AND (`__carrier_bag_has` is registered
     AND `__carrier_bag_has(next, "then")` is 1) → `__apply_closure(
     __extern_get(next, "then"), next, args)` — the same override branch
     `emitStandalonePromiseThen` uses at async-scheduler.ts L4475-L4534;
   - else if `next` is a native `$Promise` → the native subscribe (today's
     `__combinator_subscribe` body) — but with the element closures' inner
     funcs, so `[[AlreadyCalled]]` semantics are shared;
   - else → `__call_m_then_vararg(next, args)` (the vararg dispatcher the
     thenable job already uses, async-scheduler.ts L1205) preceded by
     `__promise_has_callable_then(next)`; a 0 answer throws the §7.3.14 step-2
     TypeError — same pairing Slice C used for `catch`.
   Throws propagate to the caller's try, which rejects the aggregate.
5. **Resolve-element / reject-element closures** (`buildCombinatorElemFnClosureInstrs`,
   new): a struct `$__combinator_elem_fn` subtyping
   `ensureBuiltinFnMetaType(ctx, wrapper.structTypeIdx, wrapper.closureInfo,
   "promise:elem", "", 1)` (the `(externref)->()` wrapper, exactly as
   `$__promise_settle_cap` at async-scheduler.ts L1044-L1075), adding fields
   `caps: externref` (the `$CombinatorElemCaps`) and `called: mut i32`. Its
   lifted trampoline: if `called` → return; set `called`; call the existing
   reaction func (`reaction.fulfillIdx` / `reaction.rejectIdx` — the
   `__combinator_all_fulfill` family, L889) with `(caps, value)`. Field order
   is fixed by `ensureBuiltinFnMetaType`'s layout — copy
   `buildPromiseSettleClosureInstrs` (L999) and NEVER hard-code the capture
   index. `race`'s two functions are the capability's own resolve/reject (spec:
   `Invoke(next, "then", «capability.[[Resolve]], capability.[[Reject]]»)`), so
   for `race` reuse the Slice-B `$__promise_settle_cap` pair minted for the
   RESULT promise (`ensurePromiseExecutorClosures` + `buildPromiseSettleClosureInstrs`)
   — that is what `race/resolve-self.js` and `race/same-resolve-function.js`
   assert (identity across elements).
6. **f64-vec argument admission** (the 4 `every-iteration-of-promise` rows):
   in `emitDynamicCombinatorArg` (calls.ts L10451) or a sibling arm at
   call-namespace-static.ts L2151, when the probed argument type is a
   `$Vec` whose element type is `f64`, loop it into a fresh externref `$Vec`
   boxing each element with `__box_number` (late import registered BEFORE the
   loop is built — `flushLateImportShifts`) and hand that vec to the runtime
   emitter. Keep the `isDynamicCombinatorArgEligible` refusal for native
   generators/strings as is.
7. `emitStandalonePromiseCombinator` / `…Runtime` gain one parameter
   `{ observable: { resolveLocal, ctorLocal } | undefined }`; when set they
   emit the per-element `__apply_closure(resolve, C, [v])` + step-4 call
   inside a `buildTargetTaggedTry` whose catch rejects `resultLocal` and
   breaks the loop. `remaining` accounting stays in `$CombinatorState`
   (the `all` fulfil still fires when the last element resolves; for the
   spec's "resolve before loop exit" shape — elements settling synchronously
   inside `then` — the state's `remaining` starts at n as today, which already
   models step 4.h's +1/−1 bookkeeping for a fixed-length vec).

**Order-preservation constraints (must not break).**
- Element evaluation order: array-literal element expressions are compiled
  into buffers FIRST (L2069-L2085) and only spliced after every `ensure*` —
  keep that; the `Get(C,"resolve")` is emitted AFTER the element buffers are
  evaluated (spec evaluates the argument expression before the call).
- Microtask count for the intrinsic path must not change: a program with
  `Promise.resolve = undefined`-free source must produce byte-identical wasm.
- `Get(C, "resolve")` happens exactly ONCE per combinator call, before the
  iterator is touched (`invoke-resolve-get-once-*`).
- Rejection of the aggregate on a thrown `resolve`/`then` must use the
  one-shot `rt.rejectFuncIdx` on `resultLocal`, never `__promise_reject` on a
  fresh promise.

**Rows (23).**

**Growth grant.** promise-combinators.ts +300 (new helpers
`promiseResolveObservable`, `buildCombinatorElementStep`,
`buildCombinatorElemFnClosureInstrs`, `__combinator_get_resolve` body);
call-namespace-static.ts +60 inside `compileNamespaceStaticCall` (granted);
calls.ts +30 (`emitDynamicCombinatorArg` f64 arm); async-scheduler.ts +10
(export `ensurePromiseExecutorClosures` is already exported; add
`COMBINATOR_FUNC_IDX_KEYS` entries for every new funcIdx field — L5222, the
late-import lockstep shift, or a `ref.func` baked from a stale index will
silently target the wrong function).

**Acceptance.**
(a) the 23 rows `pass` with `imports=[]`;
(b) PASSING shapes at risk — byte-identity: compile `tests/promise-combinators.test.ts`'s
four sources and `tests/deno-safe-promise-combinators.test.ts` sources with
`target:"standalone"` on base and on the branch and `Buffer.compare` the
binaries (== 0, gate is false for them); run `tests/promise-combinators.test.ts`,
`deno-safe-promise-combinators.test.ts`, `issue-2671-promise-capability.test.ts`
(its one pre-existing failure stays exactly one), `issue-3125.test.ts`,
`issue-3125-widen.test.ts` on BOTH lanes;
(c) already-passing test262 controls re-probed: build the passing set with
`ls test262/test/built-ins/Promise/{all,race}/*.js | grep -v -f <(cut -f1 .tmp/census0903/promise.tsv)`,
probe 15 of them (all `S25.4.4.*` rows plus every `iter-arg-*` and `resolve-*`
row in that set) and require every one still `pass`;
(d) equivalence gate `pnpm run test:equivalence:gate` — 24 known failures, no
new ones;
(e) a NEW control in `tests/issue-5197-promise-generic-capability.test.ts`
(or a new `tests/issue-5197-promise-observable-resolve.test.ts`, one fork):
`Promise.resolve = spy; Promise.all([1,2])` counts 2 calls and
`Promise.race([p])` on an own-`then` promise invokes that `then` — run on both
lanes; the host lane compiles to the host `Promise` and must give the same
observable counts.

#### R3-3 — `Promise.{all,race}.call(C, iterable)` for ordinary-function `C` (27 rows, M, medium risk)

**Root cause.** The `.call` arm (call-namespace-static.ts L2411-L2470) admits
only `ts.isFunctionDeclaration(ctorDecl)` + `expr.arguments.length === 2` +
an EMPTY array literal + `paramTypes.length === 1`. Slice D already widened the
sibling `resolve/reject.call` arm (L2280-L2409) to function-EXPRESSION
initializers (`ctorInit`), 1-or-2 arguments and a 0-parameter `C`; the
combinator arm was left narrow because it had no per-element pipeline. R3-2
supplies that pipeline.

**Edits.**
1. Lift the ctor-resolution block of the resolve/reject arm (L2299-L2312,
   `unwrapReflectConstructExpr` → `ctx.oracle.valueDeclarationOf` →
   `ctorInit` → `isOrdinaryCtorDecl`) into one helper
   `resolveOrdinaryCapabilityCtor(ctx, arg): {ctorArg, isOrdinary}` and use it
   in BOTH arms (do not duplicate the predicate; the two arms must admit the
   same `C`). Also admit an inline `function(executor){…}` expression argument
   (`race/capability-executor-not-callable.js` passes it directly).
2. Admit `expr.arguments.length === 1` (`Promise.all.call(CustomPromise)`):
   NewPromiseCapability runs first (C throws → propagates, `ctx-ctor-throws`);
   then `GetIterator(undefined)` → TypeError → the result promise is
   REJECTED (`rt.rejectFuncIdx`), not thrown — spec IfAbruptRejectPromise.
   Admit `paramTypes.length === 0` (the `ZeroArgConstructor` rows expect the
   steps 8-9 TypeError, which `emitStandalonePromiseCustomCapabilityCheck`
   already raises once the executor is never invoked).
3. Replace `emitStandalonePromiseCombinator(ctx, fctx, methodName, [])` at
   L2464 by: capability check (unchanged) → `resolveFn = __combinator_get_resolve(C)`
   (R3-2 step 2, with `C` = `ctorLocal` boxed via `extern.convert_any`, and the
   IsCallable TypeError → REJECT via the capability's `[[Reject]]` slot, spec
   step 6 IfAbruptRejectPromise — `all/capability-executor-called-twice.js`
   fn3/fn4 expect a THROWN TypeError for the steps-8-9 failure, which happens
   before the Get, so keep those two orders distinct) → for an array-literal
   iterable, the R3-2 generic element loop with `observable` set and the
   RESULT being the value returned by `C` (`resultLocal` of
   `emitStandalonePromiseCustomSettle`'s pattern, L400-L404), settled through
   the captured `[[Resolve]]`/`[[Reject]]` closures (`__apply_closure(slot,
   undefined, [values])`) instead of `rt.fulfillFuncIdx`. The aggregate state
   (`$CombinatorState`) still carries the results array; only the terminal
   settle changes. Non-literal iterables (`Set`, vec vars, dynamic) reuse the
   same R3-2 arms with `observable` set; custom iterables with `return` wait
   for R3-4.
4. `race` with custom `C`: the two element functions are the capability's
   resolve/reject SLOTS (the closure values C stored), passed through unchanged
   — identity is asserted by `race/same-{resolve,reject}-function.js`.

**Rows (27).**
`all/{call-resolve-element,call-resolve-element-after-return,call-resolve-element-items,capability-resolve-throws-reject,ctx-ctor-throws,invoke-resolve-return,new-resolve-function,resolve-before-loop-exit,resolve-before-loop-exit-from-same,resolve-element-function-extensible,resolve-element-function-length,resolve-element-function-name,resolve-element-function-nonconstructor,resolve-element-function-property-order,resolve-element-function-prototype,resolve-from-same-thenable,same-reject-function,S25.4.4.1_A4.1_T1}.js` (18),
`race/{S25.4.4.3_A3.1_T1,capability-executor-not-callable,ctx-ctor-throws,invoke-resolve-error-reject,invoke-resolve-return,reject-from-same-thenable,resolve-from-same-thenable,same-reject-function,same-resolve-function}.js` (9).
`resolve-element-function-nonconstructor.js` additionally needs `new fn()` on
the element closure to throw — Slice B's `__builtinfn_is_builtin` `new`-site
guard covers any builtin-fn-meta subtype, so it comes free with R3-2 step 5.

**Growth grant.** call-namespace-static.ts +60 in `compileNamespaceStaticCall`
(granted) — the admission conditions ARE the dispatch; promise-combinators.ts
+80 (`emitStandalonePromiseCustomCombinator` terminal-settle variant).

**Order constraints.** Spec order for `Promise.all.call(C, iter)`: (1)
NewPromiseCapability(C) — construct C, steps 8-9 TypeError THROWN; (2)
`Get(C, "resolve")` — abrupt ⇒ REJECT the capability; (3) GetIterator —
abrupt ⇒ REJECT; (4) per element. Today's empty-array arm skips (2) and (3)
entirely; `all/capability-executor-called-twice.js` fn3 (`resolve` getter
throws, expects the steps-8-9 TypeError, i.e. (1) wins) pins that (1) precedes
(2).

**Acceptance.** (a) the 27 rows `pass`, `imports=[]`; (b) PASSING shapes at
risk — the 6 `capability-executor-not-callable` subcases and the empty-array
`.call(fn, [])` rows (`tests/issue-4682.test.ts` all three tests, including
"keeps the non-empty custom-constructor fallback unchanged" which must be
REWRITTEN to assert the native result rather than the host fallback — say so
in the test's comment), `tests/issue-4727.test.ts`, `tests/issue-5197-promise-generic-capability.test.ts`
10/10; `all/{ctx-ctor-throws → already-passing twins} resolve/{ctx-ctor-throws,capability-invocation-error}`,
`reject/{ctx-ctor-throws,capability-executor-not-callable,S25.4.4.4_A3.1_T1}`
re-probed `pass`; (c) host lane: `tests/promise-combinators.test.ts`
"compiled-fn capability constructor (#1694 A.i)" describe block green — those
four tests run the host `Promise.all.call(fn, …)` path and must be
byte-identical (compare binaries on base vs branch).

#### R3-4 — interleaved iterator drive + IteratorClose (7 rows firm, 6 conditional, M, medium-high risk)

**Root cause.** `emitDynamicCombinatorArg` drains the whole iterable into a
`$Vec` via `__combinator_to_vec` (finalize-filled at promise-combinators.ts
L1734-L1908) BEFORE any element work. Spec interleaves `IteratorStep` with
`Call(promiseResolve)` and `Invoke(then)`, and on an abrupt element step
performs `IteratorClose(iteratorRecord)` (calls `return`). The six `*-close`
rows have a `next()` that NEVER reports `done` — the drain loops forever and
the compile lane times out or the row fails on `callCount` — and
`capability-resolve-throws-no-close.js` asserts `return` is NOT called when
the abrupt step is the capability's own `resolve` throwing (spec: IfAbruptRejectPromise
inside the loop only closes on `promiseResolve`/`then` abrupts, not on step
4.h's `Call(capability.[[Resolve]])`).

**Conditional rows — probe FIRST.** `all/{S25.4.4.1_A5.1_T1,iter-step-err-reject,iter-next-val-err-reject}.js`
and the three `race/` twins reject with "argument is not iterable" today, which
means `__combinator_to_vec` returned NULL, not that the throw escaped. Two
hypotheses, different fixes: (H1) `__call_@@iterator` does not see a
SYMBOL-keyed expando written as `obj[Symbol.iterator] = fn` on a `$Object`
(for-of works on the same object only because it takes the compile-time #2162
projection); (H2) the throw inside `__call_next` is caught and mapped to null
somewhere in the `__call_*` dispatcher. Decide with a 3-line standalone probe
that prints `typeof it[Symbol.iterator]` through `__extern_get` vs the
dispatcher; fix H1 in `emitIteratorMethodExport`'s user arm, H2 in the
dispatcher. Claim these 6 only if the fix is inside the combinator/iterator
files named here; otherwise record them as a separate issue and leave them.

**Edits.**
1. Add `__combinator_drive(iterable, state, C, resolveFn, fulfillFn, rejectFn) -> i32`
   (new, reserved at compile time beside `ensureCombinatorToVec`, filled at
   finalize in `fillCombinatorToVec`'s slot right after it — same
   `__call_@@iterator`/`__call_next`/`__sget_done`/`__sget_value` reads, same
   bare-`next` fallback). Body: acquire iterator (null ⇒ return 0 = not
   iterable); loop { `res = __call_next(it)` inside try → abrupt ⇒ reject
   aggregate, return 1 (no close — spec 4.b/4.c set `[[Done]]` true); `done`
   ⇒ break; `value` ⇒ `remaining++`; try { `next = __apply_closure(resolveFn, C,
   [value])`; `__combinator_element_step(next, …)` (R3-2 step 4) } catch ⇒
   `IteratorClose`: `__extern_get(it, "return")` — undefined/null ⇒ skip;
   not callable ⇒ TypeError but the ORIGINAL throw wins (spec IteratorClose
   step 5/6: a throw completion is returned as is); else call it and ignore
   its result — then reject the aggregate with the original reason, return 1 }.
   `$CombinatorState.remaining` becomes the spec's counter: start at 1, +1 per
   element, −1 at loop end; when it reaches 0 at loop end the aggregate
   fulfils with the results vec (which must be GROWABLE here — reuse the
   `TOVEC_*` grow pattern L1781-L1797 on the state's `resultsArr`).
2. `emitDynamicCombinatorArg` (calls.ts L10451): when `promiseResolveObservable`
   OR the call is a custom-`C` `.call` (R3-3), emit `__combinator_drive`
   instead of `__combinator_to_vec` + the runtime loop; otherwise unchanged
   (byte-identity for every module without observable resolve — the six
   `-close` rows all reassign `Promise.resolve` or define `then`, so they take
   the new path).
3. `remaining` starting at 1 changes `buildAllFulfillBody` (L889) only for
   drive-mode states; add an `i32` `mode` field to `$CombinatorState`
   (registerStruct L481) rather than branching on magic counts.

**Rows (7 firm).** `all/{invoke-resolve-error-close,invoke-then-error-close,invoke-then-get-error-close,capability-resolve-throws-no-close}.js`,
`race/{invoke-resolve-error-close,invoke-then-error-close,invoke-then-get-error-close}.js`.
**Conditional (6).** `all/{S25.4.4.1_A5.1_T1,iter-step-err-reject,iter-next-val-err-reject}.js`,
`race/{S25.4.4.3_A4.1_T1,iter-step-err-reject,iter-next-val-err-reject}.js`.

**Growth grant.** promise-combinators.ts +150 (`buildCombinatorDriveBody`, the
state `mode` field, grow helper); calls.ts +10.

**Order constraints.** `Get(C,"resolve")` precedes GetIterator; `next()` is
called at most once per element and NOT again after an abrupt step; `return`
is called exactly once on an abrupt `resolve`/`then` step and never on an
abrupt `next`/`done`/`value` read; the aggregate settles at most once.

**Acceptance.** (a) firm rows `pass`; conditional rows `pass` or recorded as a
separate issue with the probe result; (b) PASSING shapes at risk — every
existing custom-iterable combinator row: `built-ins/Promise/all/iter-arg-is-*`,
`race/iter-arg-is-*` (probe the full glob, ≤15 per batch), the async-generator
`for await` corpus is untouched (no shared code), `tests/issue-2922*.test.ts`
(if present) and `tests/promise-combinators.test.ts` on both lanes; byte-identity
for a module with a custom iterable argument and NO resolve/then reassignment
(compile `Promise.all(customIter)` on base and branch, compare binaries).

#### R3-5 — own `then` on a native `$Promise` inside Resolve, captured at Resolve time (7 rows, S, low-medium risk)

**Root cause.** `buildPromiseResolveValueBody` (async-scheduler.ts L1511)
tests `ref.test $Promise` on the peeled value (L1648-L1650) and adopts the
native state directly, so `thenable.then = f` on a native promise is never
`Get`; spec §27.2.1.3.2 steps 8-13 `Get(resolution, "then")` runs for EVERY
object. Additionally `__promise_thenable_job` (L1246-L1275) re-dispatches
`__call_m_then_vararg(thenable, …)` at job time, whereas the spec captures
`then` at Resolve time (`resolve-prms-cstm-then-immed.js` reassigns `then`
after `resolve()` and asserts the LATE function is never called).

**Edits.**
1. In `buildPromiseResolveValueBody`'s `$Promise` arm (L1648-L1720), after
   `selfCheck`, add: if `__carrier_bag_has` is registered in the module
   (`ctx.funcMap.get(CARRIER_BAG_HAS)`, carrier-bag-visibility.ts L23) AND
   `__carrier_bag_has(peeled, "then")` → `thenVal = __extern_get(peeled,
   "then")`; if `thenVal` passes `buildClosureRefTestArms` → enqueue
   `__promise_thenable_job` with caps `$__then_caps{callback: thenVal,
   chained: promise}` (today `callback` is null for this job — L1274) and
   return; else fall through to direct fulfil with `value` (a non-callable
   own `then` ⇒ step 11). When the bag natives are not registered the arm is
   absent — byte-identical for every module without promise expandos.
2. In `__promise_thenable_job`'s try body (L1246-L1275): if `caps.callback`
   is non-null → `__apply_closure(caps.callback, peeled thenable, argvec)`;
   else the existing `__call_m_then_vararg` call. Nothing else changes.
3. `fillPromiseThenableHelpers` (closed-method-dispatch.ts L1818): add a
   `ref.test $Promise` + `__carrier_bag_has` arm BEFORE the `$Object` arm so a
   `then`-bearing native promise answers 1 to `__promise_has_callable_then`
   when reached through the non-promise path (an `$AnyValue`-boxed promise).
   Gate it on `ctx.funcMap.get(CARRIER_BAG_HAS) !== undefined`.

**Rows (7).** `prototype/then/resolve-{pending,settled}-{fulfilled,rejected}-prms-cstm-then.js` (4),
`resolve-prms-cstm-then-{immed,deferred}.js` (2), `race/resolve-prms-cstm-then.js` (1).

**Growth grant.** async-scheduler.ts +60 (the two functions, both granted
above); closed-method-dispatch.ts +25.

**Order constraints.** `Get(then)` runs synchronously inside Resolve (step 9),
the CALL runs as a job (step 14); a throwing `then` getter on the native
promise rejects synchronously via the existing `poisonedLocal` path — route the
new Get through the same `buildTargetTaggedTry` (L1536-L1554) rather than a
second try.

**Acceptance.** (a) 7 rows `pass`; (b) PASSING shapes at risk — every
native-promise adoption: `tests/issue-3125.test.ts` (all 6), `issue-3125-widen`,
`promise-expando-standalone.test.ts` (which writes expandos onto promises and
must NOT make plain adoption take the job path — assert its binaries only grow
by the new arm, and that `Promise.resolve(p)` for an expando-free `p` still
adopts synchronously), `issue-4167-test262.test.ts`, `issue-2623-promise-subclass-identity`,
`issue-2867-gap4`; test262 controls `prototype/then/resolve-{pending,settled}-{fulfilled,rejected}-prms.js`
(the non-custom twins — must stay `pass`) and `resolve-self`/`resolve-settled-*-self`;
host lane byte-identical (the whole body is standalone/wasi-gated).

#### R3-6 — `SpeciesConstructor` read in `then`; `x.constructor` check in `Promise.resolve` (5 rows, S, medium risk)

**Root cause.** `emitStandalonePromiseThen` (L4286) never performs
§27.2.5.4 step 3 `SpeciesConstructor(promise, %Promise%)`; `emitStandalonePromiseResolve`
(L4164) skips §27.2.4.7.1 step 2.a `Get(x, "constructor")` and returns a
native promise unchanged (`arg-uniq-ctor.js` sets `constructor = null` and
expects a NEW promise).

**Edits.**
1. New `emitPromiseSpeciesConstructorRead(ctx, fctx, promiseLocal) -> {ctorLocal}`
   (async-scheduler.ts, beside `emitStandalonePromiseThen`), emitted only when
   `promiseSpeciesObservable(ctx, node)` — a per-file scan (same cache shape as
   `sourceHasMethodReassignment`) for: an assignment/defineProperty whose key
   is `constructor`, any `Symbol.species` token, or `defineProperty(Promise, …)`.
   Body: `c = bag has "constructor" ? __extern_get(p, "constructor") : <Promise carrier>`
   (`emitBuiltinConstructorIdentity(ctx, fctx, "Promise")`); `undefined` ⇒
   default; not an object (null/primitive — use the object runtime's
   is-object classifier, not `ref.is_null` alone) ⇒ TypeError; `s =
   __extern_get(c, @@species)` (`ensureSymbolCarrier` + `__box_symbol` 5 as in
   builtin-ctor-own-props.ts L307-L322); `s` undefined/null ⇒ default; `s`
   `ref.eq` the Promise carrier ⇒ default (native path); anything else ⇒ if
   IsConstructor fails ⇒ TypeError; if it IS a constructor, this pass has no
   `Construct(S, «executor»)` for it (G9), so fall through to the native path
   AFTER the Get/IsConstructor side effects ran, and say so in a code comment
   naming G9 (`ctor-custom` / `deferred-is-resolved-value` are the rows that
   need the real construct).
2. Call it at the top of the `nativeBody` arm of `emitStandalonePromiseThen`
   (after `promiseLocal` is set, L4363), so the override-`then` branch (an own
   `then`) is unaffected. Throws propagate synchronously out of `then` — that
   is what `ctor-null`/`ctor-poisoned`/`ctor-throws` assert.
3. `emitStandalonePromiseResolve` L4182-L4187: in the `then` (native promise)
   arm, when `__carrier_bag_has` is registered: if `bag has "constructor"` AND
   `__extern_get(v, "constructor")` is not `ref.eq` the Promise carrier ⇒ take
   the ELSE arm (new pending promise adopting `v`). Gate on the same
   `promiseSpeciesObservable` scan for byte-identity.

**Rows (5).** `prototype/then/{ctor-null,ctor-poisoned,ctor-throws,ctor-access-count}.js`,
`resolve/arg-uniq-ctor.js`.

**Growth grant.** async-scheduler.ts +80 (`emitPromiseSpeciesConstructorRead`
new; `emitStandalonePromiseThen` +10, granted).

**Order constraints.** `Get(constructor)` exactly once (`ctor-access-count`);
it precedes the reaction attach; it is NOT performed on the own-`then`
override branch (spec: `p.then` override means `Promise.prototype.then` was
never entered).

**Acceptance.** (a) 5 rows `pass`; (b) PASSING shapes at risk — every
`p.then(...)` in a module that mentions `Symbol.species` or `constructor`:
`tests/issue-2984-species.test.ts`, `issue-2984-ctor-carrier-own-props`,
`issue-5197-es2015-promise-r2.test.ts` 8/8 (Slice A species rows), `issue-2623-promise-subclass-identity`,
`issue-4746.test.ts` (Promise order rows); test262: every currently-passing
`prototype/then/*.js` row (the glob minus the census rows, ≤15 per batch) and
`Symbol.species/*.js`; byte-identity
for a module with `then` but no `constructor`/species mention (compile
`tests/issue-3125.test.ts` source 1 on base vs branch).

#### R3-7 — `p.then` / `p.catch` / `p.finally` as VALUES on a `$Promise` instance (2 rows, S, low risk)

**Root cause.** A member VALUE read of `then` off a `$Promise`-typed receiver
answers `undefined` (probe C). The reflective closure for
`Promise.prototype.then` exists (`ensurePromiseNativeProtoGlue`, brand
registered by Slice C; value read of `Promise.prototype.<m>` goes through
builtin-value-read.ts L616 / native-proto.ts `emitLazyNativeProtoGet`), but the
instance read never consults the prototype.

**Edits.** Find the site by compiling probe C with a breakpoint: the receiver
is `ref $Promise` and the name is `then` — the read resolves in
property-access-dispatch.ts (the struct-receiver member ladder) and falls to
the bag miss ⇒ `undefined`. Add, in the standalone `$Promise` receiver arm:
if the bag has no own `then`/`catch`/`finally` ⇒ push the SAME proto member
closure the `Promise.prototype.<m>` read yields (call the glue's member
closure getter; do not mint a second closure — identity `p.then ===
Promise.prototype.then` is a spec fact and `S25.4.5.3_A1.1_T2` may compare).
Reads of any OTHER member keep today's answer.

**Rows (2).** `prototype/catch/S25.4.5.1_A2.1_T1.js`, `prototype/then/S25.4.5.3_A1.1_T2.js`.

**Growth grant.** property-access-dispatch.ts +30 OR array-object-proto.ts
+40 (whichever owns the site; both granted).

**Acceptance.** (a) 2 rows `pass`; (b) PASSING shapes at risk — the own-`then`
override (`promise-expando-standalone.test.ts`: `p.then = f; p.then` must
read `f`, and `emitStandalonePromiseThen`'s override branch must still fire);
`then/context-check-on-entry.js`, `catch/{invokes-then,this-value-*}.js`
(Slice C rows) re-probed `pass`; a compiled control `typeof p.then ===
"function" && p.then === Promise.prototype.then` on both lanes.

#### R3-8 — boolean results of `.then` handlers (2 rows, S, low risk)

**Root cause.** `coerceStackValueToExternref` (async-scheduler.ts L1810) boxes
every `i32` with `f64.convert_i32_s` + `__box_number` (L1828-L1835). The
canonical i32→externref rule (type-coercion.ts L3396-L3407) honours the i32
`boolean` brand (`from.boolean === true` ⇒ `__box_boolean`). `checkSequence`
returns `boolean`, so `Promise.all([...]).then(r => compareArray(r, [true,true,true]))`
sees `[1,1,1]`.

**Edits.** In the `i32` case, if `from.boolean === true` and `__box_boolean`
is registered (`addUnionImports` registers it in both modes; call
`ensureUnionHelpersForThenWrapper`'s existing pre-registration path to make
sure it is present BEFORE the wrapper body bakes the call), emit
`call __box_boolean`; otherwise today's number box. Symbol-branded i32 is not
reachable here (a handler returning a symbol is `externref` already) — assert
that with a comment, not code.

**Rows (2).** `race/resolved-sequence.js`, `race/resolved-sequence-with-rejections.js`.

**Growth grant.** async-scheduler.ts +8.

**Acceptance.** (a) 2 rows `pass`; (b) PASSING shapes at risk — handlers
returning `number` (`tests/issue-2867*.test.ts`, `promise-combinators.test.ts`
"Promise.all with resolved values"), handlers returning `boolean` consumed
by `===` downstream; equivalence gate unchanged; host lane: the wrapper is
standalone-only (`emitThenWrapperFunction` is reached only under
`isStandaloneThenChainNativeActive`) — verify with a binary compare of
`tests/promise-combinators.test.ts` source 1 on the host lane.

#### R3-9 — GetCapabilitiesExecutor on the builtin-fn metadata carrier (3 rows, S, low risk)

**Root cause.** `$__promise_custom_capability_executor` (promise-combinators.ts
L160-L176) subtypes the bare `(externref, externref)->()` wrapper, so it has
no `name`/`length`/prototype metadata; Slice B moved the settle closures onto
`ensureBuiltinFnMetaType` for exactly this reason (`executor-function-length.js`
passes only because `closureArityField()` happens to answer 2).

**Edits.** Re-parent the struct onto
`ensureBuiltinFnMetaType(ctx, wrapper.structTypeIdx, wrapper.closureInfo,
"promise:capexec", "", 2)`; read the carrier's fields to place `$capability`
AFTER them (`capMetaFields.length`, as L1055-L1058 does); factor the two
`struct.new` mint sites (L262-L269 and L378-L387) into one
`buildCustomCapabilityExecutorInstrs(runtime, stateLocal)` so the operand
order lives in one place; the executor body's `ref.cast executorTypeIdx` +
`struct.get CLOSURE_CAPTURE_FIELD_BASE` (L188-L190) must read the NEW
capture index (`runtime.capabilityFieldIdx`), never the constant.

**Rows (3).** `executor-function-{name,property-order,prototype}.js`.

**Growth grant.** promise-combinators.ts +25 net.

**Acceptance.** (a) 3 rows `pass`; (b) PASSING shapes at risk —
`executor-function-{length,extensible}.js`, all Slice-D rows, `tests/issue-4682.test.ts`,
`issue-4727.test.ts`, `issue-5197-promise-generic-capability.test.ts` (the
executor is called from compiled `C` bodies through the wrapper `ref.test` —
the subtype chain must still pass `getFuncRefWrapperRootTypeIdx`); the
finalize `fillBuiltinFnMeta` arms must not double-register the
`(name:"", length:2)` entry (it is keyed by identity — check the entry count
in a compiled module before/after).

#### R3-10 — an initializer-less `var` is not a proof of `undefined` (2 rows, S, low risk)

**Root cause.** `provablyNullishReceiver` (builtin-prototype-brand.ts L582-L587)
accepts `ctx.oracle.typeFactOf(e).kind === "undefined"`. For `var
resolveFunction;` assigned only inside a nested function, TypeScript's
control-flow analysis narrows the top-level use to `undefined` (an evolving
`any`), which is a narrowing, not a proof; the borrowed-prototype arm then
compiles `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(resolveFunction, "prototype")`
to a static TypeError.

**Edits.** Before trusting the fact, if `e` is an identifier whose
`ctx.oracle.valueDeclarationOf(e)` is a `VariableDeclaration` with neither an
initializer nor a type annotation (or a parameter), return false. Keep the
`null` keyword and explicit `undefined`-typed declarations as proofs.

**Rows (2).** `resolve-function-nonconstructor.js`, `reject-function-nonconstructor.js`
(`hasOwnProperty.call(settleFn, "prototype")` then answers through the
builtin-fn-meta gOPD arm — `false` — and Slice B's `new fn()` guard supplies the
TypeError). `executor-function-not-a-constructor.js` also passes this gate but
then needs `isConstructor()` = `Reflect.construct(function(){}, [], fn)` →
#3371; record its new failure text, do not claim it.

**Growth grant.** none needed (builtin-prototype-brand.ts is under threshold;
+10 lines).

**Acceptance.** (a) 2 rows `pass`; (b) PASSING shapes at risk — every row that
RELIES on the static nullish throw: probe `built-ins/Object/prototype/hasOwnProperty/*.js`,
`built-ins/Object/prototype/isPrototypeOf/*.js`, `built-ins/Function/prototype/{call,apply}/*` (≤15 per
batch, currently-passing set) and `tests/issue-4623*.test.ts` if present; the
`null` literal and a `let x: undefined` receiver must still take the static
throw (add a compiled control asserting the TypeError text).

### DEFERRED (30 rows) — with the reason

| rows | why not in this pass |
| --- | --- |
| G9 (10): `{all,race,resolve,reject}/ctx-ctor.js`, `then/ctor-custom.js`, `then/deferred-is-resolved-value.js`, `then/capability-executor-{called-twice,not-callable}.js`, `{all,race}/invoke-resolve-on-promises-every-iteration-of-custom.js` | need `Construct(C, «executor»)` for a compiled `class extends Promise` with a wasm-held executor argument — the `new`-site arms are AST-driven (`emitDynamicNewFallback`, new-super.ts L3290) and the host `__promise_subclass_ctor` is unsatisfiable (`class-bodies.ts` L175-L200). The two `then/capability-executor-*` CEs are an invalid-binary bug (`extern.convert_any` on an externref call result in `__module_init_chunk_0`) in the anonymous `new class extends Promise{…}(fn)` lowering — file it as its own issue; it blocks nothing here because the rows need G9 anyway. |
| G10 (8): `{all,allSettled,any,race}/resolve-throws-iterator-return-{is-not-callable,null-or-undefined}.js` | `class BadPromise { static resolve(){throw} }` as `C` — same class-construct gap. |
| #3371 (2): `get-prototype-abrupt{,-executor-not-callable}.js` | arbitrary NewTarget — Slice G, unchanged. |
| `proto-from-ctor-realm.js` | Slice H (cross-realm), unchanged. |
| `promise.js` | `verifyProperty(this, "Promise", …)` — global-object own-property reflection, cross-cutting (#4444's global-object blocker). |
| `catch/this-value-obj-coercible.js` | §7.3.2 GetV ToObject for a primitive receiver (`Boolean.prototype.then`) — a wrapper-prototype expando lookup, separate mechanism. |
| `all/iter-arg-is-string-resolve.js` | the handler's `v.length` is typed `string[]` by TS while the native result is an externref `$Vec` → illegal cast; a type-mapping fix in the combinator's RESULT typing, not a Promise-semantics fix. |
| `exception-after-resolve-in-{executor,thenable-job}.js` | the executor-throw catch (promise-executor.ts L163-L205) rejects on PROMISE state, but `resolve(thenable)` leaves the promise pending; fixing it needs an `[[AlreadyResolved]]` record shared by the settle closures (or a new PENDING_RESOLVED state that the job's settle path is allowed to cross) — touches every settle path for 2 rows; own issue. |
| `all/resolve-thenable.js`, `all/resolve-poisoned-then.js` | Resolve of the RESULT array must `Get(array, "then")` through `Array.prototype`'s expando; `__promise_has_callable_then` has no vec arm and the array-proto expando lookup is a different substrate. |
| `then/S25.4.5.3_A5.1_T1.js` | reaction order: pending callbacks are PREPENDED (`emitStandalonePromiseThen` L4514-L4524, "FIFO append can be added later") so two `then`s on one pending promise fire LIFO. Real semantic bug worth its own issue; too much blast radius to bundle here. |
| `executor-function-not-a-constructor.js` | after R3-10 it still needs the harness `isConstructor` (`Reflect.construct` with a NewTarget) — #3371. |

### Expected yield

Firm claims: R3-1 4 + R3-2 23 + R3-3 27 + R3-4 7 + R3-5 7 + R3-6 5 + R3-7 2 +
R3-8 2 + R3-9 3 + R3-10 2 = **82 rows**; conditional +6 (R3-4 probe);
deferred 30. Measure the WHOLE 118-row list before and after each step
(file-copy A/B, refresh the "new" copy after every edit — see the Slice-D
pitfall above), and re-probe the currently-passing `built-ins/Promise/**`
ES2015 rows (the set `ls test262/test/built-ins/Promise -R` minus the census
list, ~110 rows, ≤15 per batch) once after R3-4 and once at the end — that
sweep, not the row list, is what catches a broken passing shape.

## 2026-09-03 r3 implementation (Opus)

Base: `91d4999050de75d8e71e7ec6bc18f49952c9d3bf`. Base tree materialised to
`.tmp/basetree` for file-copy A/B; every delta below is a measured before/after
pair run by this lane, not an inherited figure.

### R3-1 — capability executor: `undefined` is "not yet stored" (LANDED, +4)

`ensureCustomCapabilityRuntime` decided "a slot was already stored" with
`ref.is_null`. Under the #2864 singleton regime the canonical `undefined` is a
NON-null externref, so `executor()` / `executor(undefined, undefined)` looked
"stored" and the spec-legal follow-up `executor(f, g)` threw. The guard now
routes through the object runtime's own `__extern_is_nullish` predicate when it
is registered, and keeps the original `ref.is_null` body byte-for-byte when it
is not (legacy regime, where undefined IS the null bit pattern).

Measured, same 8-row batch, `--standalone`:

| tree | result |
| --- | --- |
| base `.tmp/basetree` | 4 pass / 4 fail (all four `capability-executor-called-twice.js`) |
| branch | 8 pass / 0 fail |

Controls green on both lanes: `tests/issue-4682.test.ts` (3/3, including the
gc/host path), `tests/issue-5197-promise-generic-capability.test.ts` (10/10),
`tests/issue-4727.test.ts`.

### R3-8 — boolean results of `.then` handlers (LANDED, +2)

`coerceStackValueToExternref`'s `i32` arm boxed every i32 with
`f64.convert_i32_s` + `__box_number`, ignoring the i32 `boolean` brand that the
canonical i32→externref rule in `type-coercion.ts` already honours. A handler
returning `boolean` therefore arrived as the number 1. The arm now picks
`__box_boolean` when `from.boolean === true` and `__box_boolean` is registered;
everything else is the previous body unchanged. The decision rides on the
ValType's own brand, so it is taken identically at all three call sites of
`coerceStackValueToExternref`, not per syntactic position.

Measured, same 2-row batch, `--standalone`: base 2 fail (`Actual [1, 1, 1] and
expected [true, true, true]`) -> branch 2 pass.

Controls green: `tests/promise-combinators.test.ts`,
`deno-safe-promise-combinators.test.ts`, `issue-3125.test.ts`,
`issue-3125-widen.test.ts`, `issue-4746.test.ts` (26 tests), plus a 15-row
currently-passing `Promise/{all,race,prototype/then}` standalone control
sample, 15/15 pass.

### R3-10 — an initializer-less `var` is not a proof of `undefined` (LANDED, +2)

`provablyNullishReceiver` accepted `typeFactOf(e).kind === "undefined"` for an
identifier whose declaration is an initializer-less, annotation-less
`var`/`let`. That is an EVOLVING `any`: TypeScript's control-flow analysis
narrows a use no assignment dominates to `undefined`, and a narrowing is not a
proof. `var resolveFunction;` filled only inside the executor therefore compiled
`hasOwnProperty.call(resolveFunction, "prototype")` to a static TypeError. The
gate now declines for that declaration shape (variable declaration or parameter
with neither type nor initializer) and keeps every genuine proof — the `null`
keyword, an explicitly `undefined`-typed binding.

Measured, same 3-row batch, `--standalone`:

| tree | result |
| --- | --- |
| base | 3 fail, all `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty called on null or undefined` |
| branch | 2 pass; `executor-function-not-a-constructor.js` advances to the predicted #3371 text (`Expected a TypeError to be thrown` from the harness `isConstructor`), NOT claimed |

Controls: a 15-row `Object/prototype/{hasOwnProperty,isPrototypeOf}` +
`Function/prototype/{call,apply}` standalone batch, 14 pass / 1 fail —
`isPrototypeOf/this-value-is-in-prototype-chain-of-arg.js` fails IDENTICALLY on
the base tree (`called value is not a function`), so it is pre-existing, not a
regression. New control `tests/issue-5197-nullish-receiver-proof.test.ts` pins
both directions on both lanes.

Note for the record: `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(x, k)` where `x` is
declared `const x: undefined = undefined` does NOT throw in the HOST lane, on
base and on this branch alike. That is a separate pre-existing gap in the
borrowed-prototype nullish fold; the control uses the `undefined` keyword
instead so it asserts something both lanes actually agree on.

### R3-9 — GetCapabilitiesExecutor on the builtin-fn metadata carrier (LANDED, +2 of 3)

`$__promise_custom_capability_executor` subtyped the bare
`(externref, externref) -> ()` func-ref wrapper, so it carried no `name`/`length`
metadata. It now subtypes `ensureBuiltinFnMetaType(…, "promise:capexec", "", 2)`
— the SAME carrier Slice B gave the settle closures — with the `$capability`
capture appended AFTER the carrier's fields and read back through the recorded
`capabilityFieldIdx`, never a hard-coded `CLOSURE_CAPTURE_FIELD_BASE`. The two
`struct.new` mint sites are factored into one
`buildCustomCapabilityExecutorInstrs`, so the operand order lives in exactly one
place.

Measured, same 5-row batch, `--standalone`:

| tree | result |
| --- | --- |
| base | 2 pass / 3 fail (`executor-function-{name,property-order,prototype}.js`) |
| branch | 4 pass / 1 fail |

The plan claimed 3 rows; only **2** are claimable.
`executor-function-prototype.js` is blocked behind a DIFFERENT gap —
`Object.getPrototypeOf(executorFunction)` compared against
`Function.prototype` reaches `Function.prototype.call is not yet implemented in
--target standalone`, the same wall Slice B recorded for
`{resolve,reject}-function-prototype.js`. Not claimed.

Controls green: `tests/issue-4682.test.ts`, `issue-4727.test.ts`,
`issue-5197-promise-generic-capability.test.ts`,
`issue-5197-es2015-promise-r2.test.ts` — 27 tests. The R3-1 8-row batch was
re-run after this change (the executor capture index moved) and is still 8/8.

### R3-5 — own `then` on a native `$Promise`, captured at Resolve time (LANDED, +6 of 7)

Two defects, one fix each:

1. `buildPromiseResolveValueBody`'s `$Promise` arm adopted the native state
   directly, so §27.2.1.3.2 steps 8-13 `Get(resolution, "then")` never ran for a
   native promise carrying an own `then`. The arm now consults
   `__carrier_bag_has(peeled, "then")` and, when present, reads the value with
   `__extern_get`: callable -> enqueue `__promise_thenable_job` with the
   function captured NOW; own-but-not-callable -> fulfil with the promise object
   itself (step 11). Absent the carrier-bag natives the arm is not emitted at
   all, so a module with no promise expandos is byte-identical.
2. `__promise_thenable_job` re-dispatched `__call_m_then_vararg` at JOB time.
   `$__then_caps.callback` (previously always null on this job) now carries the
   Resolve-time function, and the job calls it through `__apply_closure` when
   set. The old dispatch is unchanged when it is null.

The decision is keyed on the peeled VALUE's own carrier bag, so it is taken
identically however the promise reaches Resolve.

Measured, same 7-row batch, `--standalone`: base 7 fail -> branch 6 pass / 1
fail. `race/resolve-prms-cstm-then.js` is NOT claimed — it needs the observable
combinator element pipeline (R3-2/R3-3), which this pass did not reach.

Controls: `tests/promise-expando-standalone.test.ts`, `issue-3125.test.ts`,
`issue-3125-widen.test.ts`, `issue-4167-test262.test.ts`,
`issue-2623-promise-subclass-identity.test.ts`, `issue-2867-gap4.test.ts` — 60
tests green. `issue-2623-p7b-observable-resolve.test.ts` has ONE failure
(`Promise.try is not a function` in the host lane) that reproduces IDENTICALLY
on the base tree — a node-version gap, not a regression.

New control `tests/issue-5197-own-then-indirection.test.ts` (13 rows, standalone,
`imports=[]` asserted) walks the value through nine indirections — variable, two
hops, object property, array element, call return, conditional, closure capture,
function parameter — plus three negative controls. base 11 fail / 2 pass ->
branch 13/13.

Two facts the plan did not state, both confirmed against node as the oracle:

- `Promise.resolve(p)` for a native `p` is §27.2.4.7.1 step 2 (return `p`
  itself), NOT Resolve. Routing an own-`then` probe through it passes on the
  base tree and proves nothing; the control therefore enters through
  `new Promise(res => res(x))`. The identity short-circuit is pinned as its own
  negative control so this change cannot quietly "fix" it into Resolve.
- Pre-existing, unrelated, NOT touched here: `Promise.resolve(w).then(cb)` where
  `w.then = 5` runs neither callback in standalone; node throws a TypeError.

### r3 pass summary (2026-09-03, Opus implementer)

Base `91d4999050de75d8e71e7ec6bc18f49952c9d3bf`. Five of the ten r3 steps
landed, each committed separately after its own before/after measurement.

| step | plan claim | verified | not claimed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| R3-1 capability executor `undefined` slot | 4 | **4** | — |
| R3-8 boolean `.then` result box | 2 | **2** | — |
| R3-10 evolving `var` is not a nullish proof | 2 | **2** | `executor-function-not-a-constructor.js` (#3371, as the plan predicted) |
| R3-9 GetCapabilitiesExecutor metadata carrier | 3 | **2** | `executor-function-prototype.js` — blocked on `Function.prototype.call` in standalone, a gap the plan did not know about |
| R3-5 own `then` on a native promise | 7 | **6** | `race/resolve-prms-cstm-then.js` — needs the R3-2/R3-3 combinator pipeline |
| **total** | 18 | **16** | 2 |

NOT STARTED: R3-2 (23), R3-3 (27), R3-4 (7+6), R3-6 (5), R3-7 (2). R3-3 and
R3-4 depend on R3-2's element pipeline, which is the large one; R3-6 and R3-7
are independent and still open.

**Ship gate — never worse than base.** Final probe of all 25 rows this pass
touched: 23 pass / 2 fail, and both failures are the two rows named "not
claimed" above.

Regression sweep, `--standalone`, 153 rows sampled 1-in-4 from the 611
`built-ins/Promise/**` rows OUTSIDE the 118-row census (11 batches of ≤15):
90 pass / 63 non-pass. Every non-pass was A/B'd against the base tree:

- 6 rows outside the `allKeyed`/`allSettled`/`any` families
  (`prototype/finally/{is-a-method,subclass-reject-count,this-value-then-throws}.js`,
  `try/{args,promise}.js`, `withResolvers/promise.js`) fail with the IDENTICAL
  error on base — `__get_builtin` unsupported in standalone, and the
  `finally`-glue gap. Pre-existing.
- a 15-row suspect subset of the `allKeyed`/`allSettled` non-passes (every row
  whose name mentions resolve/then/thenable — the ones R3-5 could plausibly
  touch) produces the IDENTICAL non-pass set on base.

The sample was drawn as "all Promise rows minus the ES2015 census", so it
includes post-ES2015 families (`allKeyed` is a proposal) that were never
passing; that is why the raw pass rate looks low and why every non-pass needed
the base run. No pass -> non-pass transition was found.

Unit controls, both lanes: 27 (R3-9 batch) + 60 (R3-5 batch) + 26 (R3-8 batch)
+ 15 (R3-1 batch) tests green, plus the two new control files. One
pre-existing failure appears in `issue-2623-p7b-observable-resolve.test.ts`
(`Promise.try is not a function`, a host node-version gap) and reproduces on
base.

Every gate run bare before every commit: LOC, function, coercion-sites,
oracle-ratchet, dead-exports — plus `LOC_GATE_BASE=origin/main` simulations of
CI's base for the LOC and function budgets. TS7 typecheck clean.

### Round-3 review fixes (2026-09-03)

Two findings from the adversarial review of the r3 pass (both reproduced
independently by a skeptic against a `git archive 91d4999050` base, node as
oracle). The other four steps (R3-1, R3-8, R3-9, R3-5 main path) are untouched.

**F1 (high) — R3-10 landed on a constant-false lowering.** Declining the static
nullish proof for an initializer-less JS `var` did NOT make the receiver
dynamic in standalone: the checker still narrows the use to `undefined`, so
`compilePropertyIntrospection` (object-ops.ts) took its struct-field fold and
answered a constant `false` without reading the receiver. (The producer named
by the review, `call-object-builtins.ts`' refused-import fallback, is not the
path — `__hasOwnProperty` is a native define in standalone; the constant came
from the fold.) Consequences: a genuinely-undefined `var` stopped throwing
(base: TypeError), and the executor-filled `var` answered `false` for
`"length"`/`"name"` (node: true).

Fix:
- `provablyNullishReceiver` now declines the evolving-`var` shape ONLY for
  `Object.prototype.{hasOwnProperty,propertyIsEnumerable}` — the two whose
  borrowed lowering is the runtime own-property query. `isPrototypeOf` and
  `valueOf` go back to base's static fold: their borrowed `.call` lowers through
  the builtin method-value carrier whose native body does not perform
  `ToObject(this)`, so declining there would be a silent non-throw (measured:
  `var w; Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf.call(w, {})` returned `false`).
- `compilePropertyIntrospection` routes an evolving `var` the checker narrowed
  to nullish (`evolvingVarNullishNarrowed`, builtin-prototype-brand.ts) into
  its existing externref runtime arm (`__hasOwnProperty` /
  `__propertyIsEnumerable`) and precedes the call with a runtime nullish guard
  (`emitEvolvingNullishReceiverGuard`: `__extern_is_nullish` under the
  singleton regime, `ref.is_null` otherwise) that throws the same
  `TypeError: Object.prototype.<m> called on null or undefined` the static gate
  compiles. No-host lanes only; host is byte-identical.

Given up: nothing from the two claimed R3-10 rows. `isPrototypeOf`/`valueOf` on
an evolving `var` return to base behaviour (static TypeError) — no test262 row
depended on them.

| probe (standalone, JS input) | node | base | lane before | lane now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| p23 `var u; hasOwnProperty.call(u,"a")` | TypeError | TypeError | `false`, no throw | TypeError |
| p9 nullish-var bitmask (6 borrowed methods + later-filled var) | 0 | 0 | 5381 | 0 |
| p18 (hOP/isPrototypeOf/pIE/valueOf on undefined var) | 0 | 0 | 85 | 0 |
| p24b executor-filled var `[prototype,length,name,pIE,isProtoOf,typeof]` | 111111 | 222221 | 133111 | 111111 |
| synthetic t262 `undef-var-throws.js` | pass | pass | FAIL | pass |
| synthetic t262 `own-length.js` | pass | fail (TypeError) | fail (false≠true) | pass |

wasi: lane == base on p9/p18/p24b before and after (the wasi borrowed arm
never reached the fold). host: identical binaries.

**F2 (medium) — IsCallable(thenAction) missed bound functions.** The R3-5 arm
decided callability with one `ref.test <funcref-wrapper root>`; a bound
function (`$__bound_fn`) and the runtime-eval carrier failed it and the outer
promise was fulfilled with the promise OBJECT. Fix: the arm now calls
`__typeof_function`, the classifier predicate filled at finalize from
`buildClosureRefTestArms` (closures, bound functions, runtime-eval carrier,
boundary callable) — so it also sees carriers minted after the resolve body is
built. The root `ref.test` remains only as the fallback when the predicate
cannot be registered.

| own `then` = | node | base | lane before | lane now (standalone) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bound function (p_f2) | 77 | 1 (adopted) | promise object | 77 |
| bound / plain / closure / arrow (p_diag `<digit><called>`) | 11/11/11/11 | 20/20/20/20 | 30/11/11/11 | 11/11/11/11 |
| plain, arrow, bound, class method, `Math.max`, `{}`, 42, null | 11110333 | — | — | 11110333 |

Residual on **wasi only** (pre-existing, reproduced on base): a bound `then`
whose body reads `this.k` as a call argument in a function compiled before any
`{k}` shape is registered reads `undefined` on wasi — `var f = (function(r){
r(this.k) }).bind({k:77}); f(cb)` gives `undefined` on BASE wasi too
(p_bt3 row C = 144 base and lane), and seeding a `{k:0}` literal earlier makes
the own-`then` row answer 77 (p_bt5). So on wasi the bound own-`then` is now
CALLED (spec) but may settle with `undefined` where base adopted the native
state (1). Standalone is unaffected (77). Not fixed here: it is the wasi
order-dependent dynamic read on `this`, not the callability decision.

wasi, per kind (base → lane): plain 2→1, arrow 2→1, class method 2→1,
`{}`/42/null 2→3 (step 11, node 3), bound 2→4 (the residual above),
`Math.max` TRAP→TRAP (identical on base — a pre-existing wasi trap on the
`Math.max` value read, not this arm).

Verification (standalone runner, this worktree): the 25 rows the pass touched
are 23 pass / 2 fail, the two failures being the two rows the pass never
claimed (`executor-function-prototype.js`, `race/resolve-prms-cstm-then.js`)
— all 16 claimed rows kept. The 174-row currently-passing `built-ins/Promise`
ES2015 control pool: 171 pass; the 3 non-passes (`all/ctx-non-ctor.js`,
`race/ctx-non-ctor.js`, `prototype/then/S25.4.5.3_A1.1_T1.js`) fail with the
identical "quickjs provider is not built" harness error on the base tree in
this container (eval-dependent rows, no built quickjs artifact) — not a
compiler result.

Controls: `tests/issue-5197-nullish-receiver-proof.test.ts` gains a JS-input
(`.js` fileName) row asserting an EXISTING own key and the nullish throw;
`tests/issue-5197-own-then-indirection.test.ts` gains the eight-kind
callability matrix (node oracle 11110333).
