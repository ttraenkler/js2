# Issue #226: valueOf/toString coercion on comparison operators

## Status: done

## Summary

8 tests fail because comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) do not call `valueOf()` or `toString()` on object operands. Tests like `11.8.2-1.js` create objects with custom `valueOf` methods and compare them. The wasm codegen treats objects as opaque refs instead of invoking their coercion methods.

## Root Cause

The comparison codegen emits `f64.gt`/`f64.lt` etc. directly, but when operands are object types (struct refs), it does not first invoke the `valueOf` method to get the numeric primitive. JS spec requires ToPrimitive coercion before comparison.

For class-based objects, the existing coercion infrastructure (from #138) already handles this by looking up `ClassName_valueOf` in funcMap. The issue was specifically with **object literal** valueOf properties, which are stored as `externref` in struct fields and cannot be called via `call_ref`.

## Implementation

### Changes:
1. **`src/codegen/index.ts`**: In `ensureStructForType`, changed callable properties named `valueOf` or `toString` to use `eqref` field type instead of `externref`. This preserves the GC struct reference (closure) so it can be recovered and called.

2. **`src/codegen/index.ts`**: Added `valueOfClosureTypes` context field to track which closure struct types are used for valueOf fields per struct type.

3. **`src/codegen/expressions.ts`**: In `coerceType`, added handling for `eqref` valueOf fields that dispatches through tracked closure types using `ref.test`/`ref.cast`/`call_ref`. This enables per-instance valueOf dispatch even when different object instances have different closure implementations.

4. **`src/codegen/expressions.ts`**: Added coercion path from `ref`/`ref_null` to `eqref` (no-op, since GC struct refs are subtypes).

5. **`src/codegen/expressions.ts`**: In `compileObjectLiteralForStruct`, track closure struct types used for valueOf/toString fields by inspecting emitted instructions.

6. **`src/emit/binary.ts`**, **`src/emit/wat.ts`**: Added `ref.null.eq` instruction support and `eqref` type rendering.

### Key design decisions:
- Used `eqref` instead of `externref` for valueOf fields to avoid the `extern.convert_any` wrapping that makes closures un-callable.
- Only applied the `eqref` change to properties named `valueOf` or `toString` to minimize impact on other code.
- Used per-struct tracking of closure types to limit the dispatch chain size (only tries closure types actually used for that struct's valueOf).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Comparison operators invoke valueOf on object operands
- [x] valueOf with captured variables works correctly
- [x] No regression in numeric comparison tests
- [x] No regression in existing valueOf tests (#138, #139)

## Complexity: M
