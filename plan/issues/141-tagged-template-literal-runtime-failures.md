# Issue #141: Tagged template literal runtime failures

## Status: Done

## Problem
Tagged template literals compiled but produced wrong results in several scenarios:
1. Excess substitutions beyond declared function parameters caused Wasm validation errors
2. Rest parameters at index > 1 were not handled (only restIndex === 1 worked)
3. The test262 skip filter was overly broad, skipping all tagged template tests with assertions

## Root Causes

### Bug 1: Excess substitutions
When a tagged template had more substitutions than the tag function declared parameters
(e.g., `oneParam\`a${1}b${2}c\`` where `oneParam` only takes `strings: string[]`),
ALL substitutions were pushed onto the Wasm stack as arguments. This caused Wasm
validation to fail because the function signature didn't accept the extra arguments.

**Fix**: Limit substitutions to `Math.min(substitutions.length, paramTypes.length - 1 - captureCount)`
for known functions, and `Math.min(substitutions.length, closureInfo.paramTypes.length - 1)`
for closure-based tags.

### Bug 2: Rest params at non-1 index
The rest parameter handling only worked when `restInfo.restIndex === 1` (i.e.,
`tag(strings, ...values)`). Functions like `tag(strings, a, ...values)` where
the rest param was at index 2+ fell through to the positional args path.

**Fix**: Generalized to handle any `restIndex` by pushing positional subs before
the rest index, then packing remaining subs into the rest vec.

### Bug 3: Overly broad skip filter
The test262 skip filter `if (/tag\s*`/.test(source) && /assert/.test(source))`
skipped ALL tagged template tests with assertions, including ones we could handle.

**Fix**: Narrowed to three specific filters:
- `.raw` property access (not yet supported)
- Template object identity checks (caching not implemented)
- IIFE/call expression as tag (compiler only supports identifier tags)

## Remaining Work (Future Issues)
- `.raw` property on template strings array (requires WasmGC struct subtyping)
- Non-identifier tag expressions (IIFE, member expressions, call expressions)

## Files Changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- Fixed excess substitution handling and generalized rest params
- `tests/equivalence.test.ts` -- Added tests for excess subs and empty leading string parts
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- Narrowed tagged template skip filter

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
All three core bugs (excess substitutions, rest params at non-1 index, overly broad skip filter) were fixed in prior work. Template object caching per call site was also implemented using module globals. This completion adds a comprehensive test suite (`tests/issue-141.test.ts`) with 15 tests validating all fixed behaviors.

### Files changed
- `tests/issue-141.test.ts` -- New: 15 comprehensive tagged template tests
- `plan/issues/sprints/0/141.md` -- Moved from ready/ to done/
- `plan/issues/backlog/backlog.md` -- Updated status
- `plan/log/issues-log.md` -- Added completion entry

### Tests now passing
- All 15 tests in `tests/issue-141.test.ts`
- All 10 existing tagged template equivalence tests (no regressions)
