# #1035 — WASI hello-world with node:fs translated to WASI

## Goal

Produce a standalone native executable from a simple TypeScript program that:

1. Prints `"hello world"` to stdout via **`console.log`**
2. Writes `"hello world"` to a file via the **Node.js filesystem API** (`fs.writeFileSync` or the `node:fs` equivalent)

The compiler should translate:
- `console.log(...)` → WASI `fd_write` on stdout (fd=1)
- `fs.writeFileSync(path, data)` → WASI `path_open` + `fd_write` + `fd_close` (relative to a preopened directory)

The compiled `.wasm` module must run on a standard WASI runtime (`wasmtime`, `wasmer`, or `wazero`) as a native executable, producing both outputs without any JS host runtime.

**This proves js2wasm can target WASI for real end-to-end workloads that touch the filesystem**, not just numeric compute.

## Why this matters

js2wasm already has a `--target wasi` flag that emits `fd_write` and `proc_exit` imports for `console.log`. That covers stdout but nothing else. The interesting gap is **file I/O** — the natural JS idiom is `fs.writeFileSync`, and the natural WASI primitive is `path_open` + `fd_write`. Bridging those two is a concrete, shippable capability:

- **Real-world compile target:** Most WASI use cases involve reading/writing files. Without fs, the target is toy-only.
- **Clean host-boundary model:** `node:fs` is a Node builtin (parallel to #1032's axios premise), but in WASI mode the target host is not Node — it's the WASI runtime. So the compiler needs to **re-route** Node builtin imports to WASI syscalls, not just pass them through.
- **Proof of dual-target:** A single TypeScript source that uses `console.log` + `fs.writeFileSync` should compile to both:
  - JS-host mode → host `console.log` + host `fs.writeFileSync`
  - WASI mode → WASI `fd_write` to stdout + WASI `path_open` / `fd_write` / `fd_close`
  Same source, two targets. That's the dual-mode architecture principle (#679/#682) applied to I/O.

## The test program

Create `examples/wasi/hello-fs.ts`:

```ts
import { writeFileSync } from 'node:fs';

const msg = 'hello world\n';

console.log(msg.trimEnd());
writeFileSync('hello.txt', msg);
```

That's it. Simple, testable, exercises both I/O paths. Runtime expected behavior:
1. Process writes `hello world\n` to stdout
2. Process creates `hello.txt` containing `hello world\n` in the preopened directory
3. Process exits with code 0

## Compilation target

```bash
npx js2wasm examples/wasi/hello-fs.ts --target wasi -o hello-fs.wasm
```

Run:
```bash
wasmtime --dir=. hello-fs.wasm
```

Expected output:
```
hello world
```

And after:
```bash
cat hello.txt
# hello world
```

## Implementation

### Step 1 — Map `node:fs` to WASI imports at compile time

When `--target wasi` is set, the compiler needs to recognize `node:fs` imports and bind them to WASI runtime intrinsics instead of leaving them as unresolved externref imports. Add resolver logic in `src/codegen/imports.ts`:

```ts
// When --target wasi and the module is node:fs (or bare 'fs'):
//   writeFileSync → emit a helper function that uses path_open + fd_write + fd_close
//   readFileSync  → emit a helper that uses path_open + fd_read + fd_close
//   existsSync    → path_filestat_get
//   mkdirSync     → path_create_directory
//   unlinkSync    → path_unlink_file
```

For Sprint 41 scope, only `writeFileSync` is required. The other fs functions are follow-ups (see below).

### Step 2 — Implement the `__wasi_write_file_sync` runtime helper

New function in the WASI runtime library (`src/runtime/wasi-fs.ts` or equivalent), compiled into the Wasm output when the target is WASI:

```ts
// Compiled to pure WasmGC + WASI imports — no JS host.
function __wasi_write_file_sync(path: string, contents: string): void {
  // 1. Resolve the preopened directory fd (convention: fd=3 for the first --dir)
  const dirFd = 3;  // TODO: walk the preopens table at init for robustness

  // 2. Encode path and contents as UTF-8 byte arrays
  const pathBytes = encodeUTF8(path);
  const contentsBytes = encodeUTF8(contents);

  // 3. path_open(dirfd, dirflags, path, path_len, oflags, rights_base, rights_inheriting, fdflags, fd_out)
  //    oflags = O_CREAT | O_TRUNC
  //    rights = FD_WRITE
  const fd = wasi.path_open(
    dirFd,
    0,            // dirflags
    pathBytes,
    pathBytes.length,
    OFLAGS_CREAT | OFLAGS_TRUNC,
    RIGHTS_FD_WRITE,
    0,            // rights inheriting
    0,            // fdflags
  );

  // 4. fd_write(fd, iovec_ptr, iovec_len, written_ptr)
  wasi.fd_write(fd, contentsBytes, contentsBytes.length);

  // 5. fd_close(fd)
  wasi.fd_close(fd);
}
```

Host imports needed (new, add to WASI target import table):
- `wasi_snapshot_preview1.path_open`
- `wasi_snapshot_preview1.fd_write` (already present for stdout)
- `wasi_snapshot_preview1.fd_close`
- `wasi_snapshot_preview1.fd_prestat_get` (for resolving the preopen fd at init — phase 2)
- `wasi_snapshot_preview1.fd_prestat_dir_name`

### Step 3 — Preopen discovery (phase 2, can be punted)

For the first cut, hardcode `dirFd = 3` as a reasonable default (`wasmtime --dir=.` passes fd 3 as the first preopen). Phase 2: walk the preopen table at module init to find the fd by name (`.` or `/`). Document the limitation in the example's README.

### Step 4 — Native executable wrapping

After the `.wasm` binary works in `wasmtime`, wrap it as a native executable using one of:

1. **wasmtime AOT compile:**
   ```bash
   wasmtime compile hello-fs.wasm -o hello-fs.cwasm
   wasmtime run --allow-precompiled hello-fs.cwasm
   ```
   This creates a precompiled module that runs without JIT.

2. **wasi-sdk `wasmer create-exe` (native binary):**
   ```bash
   wasmer create-exe hello-fs.wasm -o hello-fs
   ./hello-fs
   ```
   This produces a single self-contained native binary (Linux/macOS/Windows).

3. **wazero embedded in Go (compile-once-run-anywhere):**
   A tiny Go wrapper program embeds the `.wasm` and runs it. Produces a single Go-compiled static binary.

For the acceptance test, **option 2 (`wasmer create-exe`)** gives the clearest "native executable" story: one binary file, no runtime installed, just run it. Document all three approaches in the example README.

### Step 5 — Test harness

Add `tests/wasi-hello-fs.test.ts`:

```ts
import { test, expect } from 'vitest';
import { execSync } from 'node:child_process';
import { readFileSync, unlinkSync, existsSync } from 'node:fs';
import { compile } from '../src/index';

test('hello-fs compiles to WASI and runs end-to-end', async () => {
  // Compile
  const src = readFileSync('examples/wasi/hello-fs.ts', 'utf-8');
  const result = await compile(src, { target: 'wasi', fileName: 'hello-fs.ts' });
  expect(result.success).toBe(true);

  // Write the .wasm to disk
  const wasmPath = '/tmp/hello-fs.wasm';
  writeFileSync(wasmPath, result.wasm);

  // Clean up any prior hello.txt
  if (existsSync('/tmp/hello.txt')) unlinkSync('/tmp/hello.txt');

  // Run under wasmtime with /tmp as preopen
  const stdout = execSync(`wasmtime --dir=/tmp ${wasmPath}`, {
    cwd: '/tmp',
    encoding: 'utf-8',
  });

  // Verify stdout
  expect(stdout.trim()).toBe('hello world');

  // Verify file was written
  expect(existsSync('/tmp/hello.txt')).toBe(true);
  expect(readFileSync('/tmp/hello.txt', 'utf-8')).toBe('hello world\n');
});
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `examples/wasi/hello-fs.ts` exists and uses `console.log` + `writeFileSync` from `node:fs`
- [ ] `npx js2wasm examples/wasi/hello-fs.ts --target wasi -o hello-fs.wasm` succeeds
- [ ] Running `wasmtime --dir=. hello-fs.wasm` prints `hello world` to stdout
- [ ] Running `wasmtime --dir=. hello-fs.wasm` creates `hello.txt` containing `hello world\n`
- [ ] `tests/wasi-hello-fs.test.ts` added and passes
- [ ] At least one native-executable wrapping approach documented and demonstrated (`wasmer create-exe` preferred)
- [ ] The example's README explains all three wrapping options with commands and caveats
- [ ] **Stretch:** the same source, compiled without `--target wasi`, also runs in JS-host mode (proves dual-target)

## Non-goals

- Full `node:fs` surface — this issue only requires `writeFileSync`. `readFileSync`, `existsSync`, `mkdirSync`, `readdirSync`, `statSync`, etc. are follow-up issues (see below).
- Async fs API (`fs.promises.*`, `fs/promises`) — synchronous only for this scope
- Stream API — complex, separate issue
- Permission model / security — WASI preopens handle this naturally, no extra work
- Cross-platform path handling — assume POSIX paths; Windows-specific path semantics are a follow-up
- File descriptor reference counting beyond open/close pair — no leaks, but no FD pool either

## Follow-up issues to file after #1035 lands

- **#1036** `node:fs` readFileSync → WASI `path_open` + `fd_read` + `fd_close`
- **#1037** `node:fs` existsSync / statSync → WASI `path_filestat_get`
- **#1038** `node:fs` mkdirSync → WASI `path_create_directory`
- **#1039** `node:fs` unlinkSync → WASI `path_unlink_file`
- **#1040** `node:fs` readdirSync → WASI `fd_readdir`
- **#1041** Preopen table discovery at init instead of hardcoded fd=3
- **#1042** `node:fs/promises` async variants routed through WASI (probably wraps the sync calls; WASI has no native async)
- **#1043** `node:path` → pure-WasmGC path joining/resolving (no WASI syscalls needed, purely string manipulation)
- **#1044** `process.argv` / `process.env` → WASI `args_get` / `environ_get`

Each of these is a narrow, well-scoped issue with clear WASI primitive mapping. The discovery here — "how to wire a Node builtin module to WASI intrinsics at compile time" — unlocks all of them.

## Design notes

**Why `writeFileSync` first and not `readFileSync`?**

Writing is strictly simpler than reading:
- No buffer allocation sizing decisions
- No UTF-8 decoding of variable-length output
- No "how much did I get" loop

Writing gets the end-to-end plumbing (compile-time recognition + runtime helper + WASI import binding) working first. Reading is a natural follow-up that reuses the same path_open + close scaffolding.

**Why `node:fs` and not `fs`?**

Both should be recognized — the `node:` prefix is just a disambiguator. The compiler should normalize `'node:fs'` and `'fs'` to the same target. The example uses `node:fs` because it's the modern, explicit form that makes the "this is a Node builtin being re-routed to WASI" semantics unambiguous in the source.

**Dual-target source.**

The killer demo is: the exact same `.ts` source file runs under both:
```bash
# JS host mode
node --experimental-vm-modules -e "require('js2wasm').run(readFileSync('hello-fs.ts'))"

# WASI mode
wasmtime --dir=. hello-fs.wasm
```

Both produce the same stdout and the same `hello.txt`. This demonstrates that js2wasm's import resolver correctly dispatches the SAME `node:fs` import to the SAME JS `fs` module in one target, and to the WASI path_open/fd_write/fd_close chain in the other target — with zero source changes. This is the "dual-mode" architecture principle (CLAUDE.md) applied to filesystem I/O.

**Why `wasmer create-exe` for the native executable wrapping?**

- Produces a real, self-contained native binary (no runtime installed on the target machine)
- Cross-platform (Linux / macOS / Windows)
- Single file, easy to distribute
- Zero-dependency at runtime

`wasmtime compile` is faster at build time but requires wasmtime to be installed at runtime. `wazero+Go` is cleaner dependency-wise but requires a Go toolchain. `wasmer create-exe` hits the sweet spot for "here's a native executable I compiled from TypeScript."

## Related

- Complements the real-world stress-test set (#1031 lodash, #1032 axios, #1033 react, #1034 prettier) with a **production-shaped WASI example** — the first compile output you can actually hand to someone as a ".exe I built from a .ts file"
- Depends on existing `--target wasi` fd_write support for `console.log`
- Enables the native-executable benchmark thread: compile a small TS program to a native binary and measure cold-start, memory, and execution time against `node hello-fs.ts`
- Parallel in spirit to #1032's "Node builtins as host imports in JS-host mode" — the distinction is that for WASI mode, the same Node builtin imports are re-routed to WASI syscalls rather than externref host imports

## Implementation summary

Landed in two parts:

1. **Compiler core** (`50a8caba3` — `feat(wasi): map node:fs writeFileSync to WASI path_open + fd_write + fd_close`):
   - `src/compiler.ts:detectNodeFsImports` — scans the original source for
     named imports from `node:fs` / `fs` *before* `preprocessImports` strips
     them, returning the set of imported function names. Result is stored
     on `ctx.wasiNodeFsFuncs`.
   - `src/codegen/index.ts:registerWasiImports` — when `writeFileSync` is
     in `wasiNodeFsFuncs`, registers `wasi_snapshot_preview1.path_open`
     and `wasi_snapshot_preview1.fd_close` imports in addition to the
     existing `fd_write` / `proc_exit`. Linear memory + bump-pointer global
     are reserved (page 0, scratch area 0..1023, data segments above).
   - `src/codegen/index.ts:emitWasiWriteFileSyncHelper` — emits a
     `__wasi_write_file_sync(pathPtr, pathLen, dataPtr, dataLen)` helper
     that:
       1. Calls `path_open(dirfd=3, dirflags=0, path, path_len, oflags=O_CREAT|O_TRUNC=9, rights_base=FD_WRITE=64, rights_inheriting=0, fdflags=0, fd_out=12)`
       2. Loads the opened fd from `memory[12]`
       3. Writes the data via `fd_write` with an iovec at `memory[0..7]` and the nwritten output at `memory[8]`
       4. Calls `fd_close(fd)`
   - `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` — at `writeFileSync(path, data)`
     call sites in WASI mode, emits the path/data string bytes via
     `wasiAllocStringData` (compile-time data segment) for string literals
     and via `compileWasiStringArgToLinearMemory` for `const x = '...'`
     style references, then calls `__wasi_write_file_sync`.
   - Also fixed a pre-existing bug where the unified import collector
     registered `console_log_string` JS host imports even in WASI mode,
     causing invalid binaries with conflicting externref/i32 types.

2. **Example + documentation** (this commit):
   - `examples/wasi/README.md` — explains the three native-executable
     wrapping approaches (`wasmer create-exe`, `wasmtime compile`,
     wazero-in-Go) with commands, pros/cons, and caveats.
   - Documents the dual-target story (same source compiles in both WASI
     and JS-host modes without changes).

The hardcoded `dirfd = 3` matches the convention of `wasmtime --dir=.`
(first preopen gets fd 3). A proper preopen-table walk via
`fd_prestat_get`/`fd_prestat_dir_name` is tracked as #1041.

## Test Results

`tests/issue-1035.test.ts` — **5/5 passing** (verified 2026-04-26 on
worktree `issue-1035-wasi-fs-writefilesync`):

1. `compiles writeFileSync to WASI imports (no JS host imports)` — module
   only imports from `wasi_snapshot_preview1`, includes `fd_write`,
   `path_open`, `fd_close`; exports `memory` and `_start`.
2. `console.log only — no path_open/fd_close imports` — without
   `writeFileSync`, the path_open/fd_close imports are not emitted.
3. `end-to-end: writes hello.txt via WASI runtime` — runs the compiled
   `.wasm` under Node's `node:wasi` with a temp preopen, asserts
   stdout = `hello world` and the written file content matches.
4. `node:fs import without writeFileSync does not add path_open` — only
   `readFileSync` import → no path_open.
5. `bare fs module also detected` — `import { writeFileSync } from 'fs'`
   triggers the same WASI rewrite as `node:fs`.

End-to-end smoke (manual, 2026-04-26):

```
$ npx js2wasm examples/wasi/hello-fs.ts --target wasi -o /tmp/wasi-out
/tmp/wasi-out/hello-fs.wasm  (4431 bytes)
$ node --experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1 ... # via node:wasi
hello world
$ cat /tmp/wasi-test-1035/hello.txt
hello world
```

Stretch goal (dual-target): the same source also compiles cleanly in
JS-host mode (`compile(src)` returns `success: true` with `writeFileSync`
+ `console_log_string` as host imports).

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `examples/wasi/hello-fs.ts` exists and uses `console.log` + `writeFileSync` from `node:fs`
- [x] `npx js2wasm examples/wasi/hello-fs.ts --target wasi -o <dir>` succeeds (note: `-o` is the output **directory**)
- [x] Running `wasmtime --dir=. hello-fs.wasm` (or Node's `node:wasi`) prints `hello world` to stdout
- [x] Running creates `hello.txt` containing `hello world\n`
- [x] `tests/issue-1035.test.ts` added and passes (5/5)
- [x] At least one native-executable wrapping approach documented (`wasmer create-exe`)
- [x] The example's README explains all three wrapping options with commands and caveats
- [x] **Stretch:** same source compiles in JS-host mode (without `--target wasi`)
