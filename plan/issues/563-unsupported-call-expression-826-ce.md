# #563 — Unsupported call expression (826 CE remaining)

## Status: in-review
Still the #1 CE bucket. 826 tests fail with "Unsupported call expression" (down from 3,491 after tech lead fixes). Down from 3,711 last run but still dominant (46% of all CEs).

Needs sub-analysis to identify which specific call patterns remain after previous fixes (#409, #517, #530 all done).

## Complexity: L

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added a new `compileExpressionCallee` function to handle call expressions where the callee is a non-LeftHandSideExpression wrapped in parentheses. Previously, these would cause infinite recursion because `ts.factory.createCallExpression` re-wraps non-LHSE expressions in `ParenthesizedExpression`.

The new function handles:
1. **Assignment expressions as callee**: `(x = fn)()` — compiles the assignment for side effects, then calls the RHS function directly if identifiable, or falls through to closure-matching.
2. **Other binary expressions as callee**: `(a || fn)()`, `(a && fn)()` — same closure-matching strategy.
3. **Prefix/postfix unary as callee**: rare but possible edge cases.

The implementation:
- For simple assignment `(x = fn)()` where `fn` is a known function/closure: compiles the assignment for side effects, drops result, then creates a direct call using the RHS identifier.
- For generic cases: uses type-checker call signatures to find a matching closure type in `closureInfoByTypeIdx`, then compiles the expression to get the closure on the stack and uses `call_ref`.
- As a last resort for binary expressions: compiles the expression for side effects, drops result, and tries calling the RHS if it's an identifier or property access.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — Added `compileExpressionCallee` function (~130 lines); modified paren unwrap block in `compileCallExpression` to route assignment/binary/unary expressions through the new handler instead of `ts.factory.createCallExpression` (which causes infinite recursion).

### Tests
- Added `tests/call-expression-patterns.test.ts` with 3 tests covering assignment callee, comma callee, and conditional callee patterns.
- All existing tests pass (no regressions).
