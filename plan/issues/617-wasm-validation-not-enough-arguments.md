# #617 — Wasm validation: not enough arguments for drop (109 CE)

## Status: in-progress

109 tests fail with "not enough arguments on the stack for drop (need 1, got 0)". The compiler emits a `drop` instruction when the stack is empty.

This happens when an expression is expected to produce a value (for dropping) but the codegen path produces void instead. Likely in async function returns or conditional expressions where one branch is void.

## Complexity: S
