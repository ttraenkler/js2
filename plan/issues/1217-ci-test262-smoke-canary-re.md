# #1217 — Smoke-canary: detect future test262 drift regressions

## Problem

After the sprint 45/46 drift fixes (cache-key invalidation #1171, CT
exclusion #1192, baseline refresh #1191), residual non-deterministic
drift still appears on no-op PRs (PR #104 saw 48 non-CT regressions on
a docs-only change — see #1190 audit). We don't have an active mechanism
to catch when drift gets *worse* — a future change to vitest config,
node version, or test infrastructure could silently regress
deterministic-ness without anyone noticing until the gate starts
producing false positives at a higher rate.

A smoke-canary closes that observability gap.

## Fix

Add a scheduled (or push-to-main-triggered) workflow that:

1. Checks out `main` HEAD.
2. Runs `Test262 Sharded` **twice** with **fresh cache** (no restore-keys).
3. Compares the two results: flip count = number of tests that flipped
   pass↔non-pass between the two runs.
4. Posts the flip count to a status feed (similar to ci-status feed).
5. Fails the workflow (or warns prominently) if flip count > N
   (suggested initial threshold: N=10, tune after first runs).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] New workflow `.github/workflows/test262-canary.yml` runs on
  schedule (suggested: nightly) and on `workflow_dispatch`.
- [ ] Workflow runs main HEAD twice with `actions/cache` disabled or
  with `key: 'no-cache'`.
- [ ] Workflow output reports flip count distinctly from regression
  count (this measures *engine determinism*, not compiler change).
- [ ] If flip count > N, workflow fails OR posts a high-priority status.
- [ ] Threshold N is documented in the workflow file with rationale.
- [ ] Initial baseline of flip count is measured in the issue's
  comments after first run.

## Out of scope

- Statistical merge-gate metric (#1190 Q2 — separate concern, deferred).
- Per-test flake quarantine list (would solve the symptom but not the
  observability problem).
- Cross-Node-version flap detection (separate concern).

## Why this scope

The smoke-canary is the cheapest mechanism to **detect** drift
regressions, not necessarily fix them. Once we know flip count, we can
decide whether to invest in flap quarantine or runner-pool isolation.
Without the canary, we're flying blind.

## Implementation hints

- Reuse the matrix shard structure from `.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml`.
- Cache step: either omit entirely or use a key that always misses
  (e.g., `key: 'canary-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ matrix.chunk }}'`).
- Diff script: a small node script that takes two JSONL files and counts
  per-test status differences. Similar to `scripts/regression-diff.mjs`
  but symmetric (no baseline/candidate distinction).
- CPU budget: ~80 CPU-min × 2 = 160 CPU-min/run. Acceptable for nightly.

## Implementation notes (2026-05-01)

Shipped:

- `.github/workflows/test262-canary.yml` — daily-scheduled (03:30 UTC)
  + `workflow_dispatch` trigger. Two jobs:
  - `canary-shard` with a 2D matrix `run: [a, b] × chunk: [1..16]` =
    32 parallel shards. **No `actions/cache` step** — every chunk
    compiles cold so the canary measures cold-start non-determinism.
  - `compare` depends on `canary-shard`, downloads both runs'
    artifacts, merges per-run, runs the diff script, fails the
    workflow if flip count exceeds the threshold (default 10, override
    via `workflow_dispatch.inputs.flip_threshold`).
- `scripts/test262-canary-diff.ts` — symmetric diff. Categorises tests
  as match / flip / noise / missing. "Flip" = `pass <-> non-pass` —
  the headline metric. Last line is `FLIP_COUNT=N` for cheap CI grep.
- Smoke-tested locally with synthetic JSONLs: correctly identifies
  1 flip, 1 noise, 2 missing, 2 match.

### Threshold rationale (initial)

- `N=10` initial. Picked deliberately above the floor we expect on a
  well-behaved run (~0–5 flips driven by wasmtime startup jitter and
  vitest worker non-determinism) but below the sprint-45-era drift
  levels (~30–50 flips).
- Tune after the first 2–3 nightly runs once we have a real
  distribution. Initial-baseline measurement is acceptance criterion
  #6 — capture in this issue's notes after the first run lands.

### Cost / observability

- Cost: 2 × 16 chunks ≈ 32 parallel runners, ~5–10 min wall-clock,
  ~160 CPU-min per run. One nightly = ~5,000 CPU-min/month — fine.
- Observability: when the canary fails, the `test262-canary-report`
  artifact has the full diff (flip list, noise list, missing list).
  The PR-author or on-call dev can then decide whether to triage as
  flap-worthy or shrug it off as transient.
