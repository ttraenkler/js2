## Problem

The GitHub Pages site is deployed via the "Deploy GitHub Pages" workflow but served under
the default `loopdive.github.io/js2wasm` URL. The project needs a custom domain at
`js2.loopdive.com`.

## Acceptance criteria

- `https://js2.loopdive.com` resolves to the GitHub Pages site
- HTTPS enforcement is enabled (no mixed-content warnings)
- The build pipeline emits a `CNAME` file so the custom domain survives every re-deploy
- Old `loopdive.github.io/js2wasm` URL redirects to `js2.loopdive.com` (GitHub handles this automatically once the custom domain is set)

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1 — Add CNAME to build output (`scripts/build-pages.js`)

At the end of `build-pages.js`, after all assets are copied to `pages-dist/`, write a
`CNAME` file:

```js
// Emit CNAME for custom domain
writeFileSync(join(PAGES_DIST, "CNAME"), "js2.loopdive.com\n");
```

Add it right before (or after) the final `console.log("Pages build complete")` line.
The `CNAME` file must contain exactly the bare hostname with no `https://` prefix and
a trailing newline.

### Step 2 — DNS record (manual, done by Thomas in DNS provider)

Add a `CNAME` record in the Loopdive DNS zone:

```
js2.loopdive.com.  CNAME  loopdive.github.io.
```

TTL 3600 is fine. GitHub Pages accepts apex/subdomain CNAMEs equally.

### Step 3 — GitHub repository Pages settings (manual)

In `loopdive/js2` → Settings → Pages → Custom domain:
- Enter `js2.loopdive.com` and click Save
- Wait for the DNS check to pass (usually < 5 min after Step 2 propagates)
- Tick "Enforce HTTPS"

GitHub will create a `CNAME` file commit on `main` if one isn't present — the Step 1
change ensures the build pipeline keeps re-emitting it so deploys don't overwrite it.

### Step 4 — Verify

```bash
curl -I https://js2.loopdive.com
# Expect: HTTP/2 200, server: GitHub.com
```

## Notes

- The Pages workflow (`pages:write` permission, `actions/deploy-pages`) already handles
  the artifact upload; no workflow changes needed beyond the CNAME file in the output.
- If the DNS provider doesn't support CNAME on the apex, use `js2.loopdive.com` as a
  subdomain record (which it already is) — no apex issue here.
- GitHub enforces one custom domain per Pages site; if `loopdive.github.io` is used by
  another repo in the org, there's no conflict since this is a subdomain.
