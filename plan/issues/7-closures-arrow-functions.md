# Issue 7: Closures / Arrow functions

## Status: done

## Summary
Support arrow functions (`=>`) and function expressions as first-class values.

## Motivation
Closures are used extensively in array callbacks (`.map`, `.filter`), event handlers, and functional patterns.

## Design

### Wasm representation
Wasm GC + funcref approach:
- Each arrow function body compiles to a top-level Wasm function.
- A closure object is a Wasm GC struct holding a `funcref` + captured variable values.
- Calling a closure: `call_indirect` or `call_ref` via the funcref field.

### Captured variables
Variables captured from the outer scope are copied into the closure struct at creation time. Mutable captures require a mutable cell (a single-field mutable struct).

### Limitations in v1
- No recursive closures (no self-reference).
- No closure over `this` (class methods not in scope yet).
- Only called locally — not passed across the Wasm/JS boundary.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: handle `ts.isArrowFunction` / `ts.isFunctionExpression`. Collect free variables. Emit a lifted top-level function + closure struct.
- `src/codegen/index.ts`: register lifted functions during the first pass; allow anonymous function registration.
- `src/ir/types.ts`: no changes needed (funcref already exists).
- Tests: `tests/closures.test.ts`.

## Acceptance criteria
- `const double = (x: number) => x * 2; return double(5);` returns `10`.
- Capture: `const offset = 3; const add = (x: number) => x + offset; return add(5);` returns `8`.
