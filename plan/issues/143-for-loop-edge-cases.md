# Issue #143: for-loop edge cases

## Status: Done

## Problem
Tests for edge cases like `for(;;)` with break, missing update expressions, complex initializers, scope of for-loop variables.

## Investigation
Ran test262 `language/statements/for` category:
- 42 pass, 0 fail, 131 compile_error, 212 skip (non-dstr: 9 pass, 0 fail, 8 compile_error, 83 skip)

Basic for-loop edge cases (`for(;;)`, missing init/update/condition) already work correctly.

Remaining compile errors are:
- `head-init-async-of.js`: async (not fixable without Promise support)
- `head-let-destructuring.js`: destructuring in for-loop init (needs destructuring support)
- `head-lhs-let.js` / `let-block-with-newline.js` / `let-identifier-with-newline.js`: TS parser issues with `let` as identifier
- `scope-body-lex-boundary.js` / `scope-body-lex-open.js` / `scope-head-lex-close.js`: per-iteration lexical scope with closures (needs per-iteration environment)

## Changes Made
No for-loop-specific changes needed. The for-loop codegen already handles all basic edge cases correctly.

The IIFE support added for #165 also benefits for-loop dstr tests that use generator IIFEs.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added comprehensive test coverage for for-loop edge cases in `tests/issue-143.test.ts` with 14 equivalence tests verifying:
- `for(;;)` infinite loop with break
- Missing initializer, missing update, missing condition
- All parts missing (just body with break)
- `continue` and `break` within for loops
- Nested for loops (including break in inner loop)
- Expression initializer (assignment, not variable declaration)
- Zero iterations (condition false from start)
- Single-statement body (no block braces)
- Continue + update interaction (ensuring update runs after continue)
- Multiple variable declarations in initializer

### What worked
All basic for-loop edge cases already compile and execute correctly. The existing `compileForStatement` implementation properly handles optional initializer/condition/incrementor, break/continue depth tracking with the 3-level block/loop/block nesting, expression initializers, and single-statement vs block bodies.

### What didn't work
No code changes were needed. The remaining test262 failures are out of scope (async, per-iteration lexical scope with closures, TS parser edge cases with `let` as identifier).

### Files changed
- `tests/issue-143.test.ts` (new) -- 14 equivalence tests for for-loop edge cases

### Tests now passing
All 14 tests in `tests/issue-143.test.ts` pass.
