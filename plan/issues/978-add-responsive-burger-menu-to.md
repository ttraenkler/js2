# #978 — Responsive burger menu for site-nav

## Problem

The `<site-nav>` component shows all nav links inline. On mobile/narrow viewports, the links overflow or get cramped. Need a burger menu that collapses the nav links into a slide-out or dropdown panel.

## Reference

https://webassembly-org.loopdive.com/ — has a clean burger menu implementation on mobile.

## What to build

1. Add a hamburger icon button (3 bars) visible only on narrow viewports (≤768px)
2. Hide `.nav-links` and `.nav-actions` on narrow viewports by default
3. Clicking the burger toggles a slide-out or dropdown panel with all links
4. Animate the burger icon → X transition on open
5. Close menu on link click or outside click
6. All inside the `<site-nav>` shadow DOM — no external CSS needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- Desktop: no change, links show inline as today
- Mobile (≤768px): burger icon replaces inline links
- Click burger → panel slides in with all nav links + action buttons
- Click link or outside → panel closes
- Smooth open/close animation
- Works on both landing page and dashboard

## Implementation Summary

### Changes
- **`components/site-nav.js`**: Rewrote `<site-nav>` shadow DOM component with responsive burger menu

### Details
- Added `.burger` button with 3 `<span>` bars, `display: none` by default, `display: flex` at `≤768px`
- Added `.mobile-panel` fixed-position slide-out (280px wide, slides from right via `translateX`)
- CSS transitions: panel slides with `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`, burger bars animate to X via `translateY + rotate`
- `_toggle()` / `_close()` methods manage `.open` class on both burger and panel
- Outside click handler uses `composedPath()[0]` to work across shadow DOM boundary
- `disconnectedCallback` cleans up the document-level click listener
- Mobile panel duplicates nav links and action buttons from desktop nav
- All styles scoped inside shadow DOM — no external CSS changes needed
