# #634 — Accessor/getter/setter side effects not triggered (118 FAIL)

## Status: in-progress

118 tests fail because getter/setter side effects (like setting an `accessed` flag) are not being triggered. The tests check that property access invokes getters and property assignment invokes setters.

### Root cause
When accessing properties on struct-backed objects, the compiler may bypass the getter/setter and directly access the struct field. Need to check if the property has a descriptor with get/set and invoke those.

### Findings

The basic getter/setter mechanism (classAccessorSet, funcMap-based getter/setter calls) works correctly for:
- Class getters/setters accessing `this` members
- Object literal getters/setters accessing `this` members
- Module-level variable access from getter/setter bodies

The **actual bug** was: object literal getter/setter functions could not access variables from the enclosing function scope (closure captures). The getter/setter was compiled as a separate Wasm function, but variables from the enclosing scope were only available as locals in the parent function -- inaccessible from the accessor.

**Fix**: Added `promoteAccessorCapturesToGlobals()` which:
1. Scans accessor body for referenced identifiers
2. For each that maps to a local in the enclosing function, creates a Wasm global
3. Copies the local's current value to the global
4. Removes the name from localMap so subsequent code also uses the global
5. Registers in ctx.capturedGlobals for resolution in the accessor body

### Remaining failures (not addressed by this fix)
- Object rest destructuring (`{...x}`) doesn't invoke getters during spread
- Private getter/setter tests also require hasOwnProperty, verifyProperty, generators
- Computed property accessor name tests require wasm:js-string support

## Complexity: M
