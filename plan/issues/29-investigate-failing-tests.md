# Issue 29: Investigate failing tests

## Status: done

## Summary
2 tests are currently failing (101 passed, 2 failed out of 103). Investigate and fix.

## Motivation
Failing tests indicate regressions or incomplete implementations that should be addressed.

## Scope
- Run `pnpm test` and identify the 2 failing tests
- Diagnose root cause
- Fix or document as known limitation

## Complexity: XS–S

## Acceptance criteria
- All 103 tests pass, or failing tests are documented with a reason
