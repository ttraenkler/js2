# #1166 — Closed-world integer specialization from literal call sites

## Problem

Phase 2 (#1131) propagates types from **export boundaries** — if `run` is
annotated `@param {number}`, that seeds `f64` into `fib`. But `f64` is
imprecise for integer-valued computations:

```js
function fib(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
function run(n) { return fib(n); }

console.log(run(30)); // ← compiler can see this
```

`run(30)` is a literal integer call site within the same compiled module. The
compiler has a **closed world** — `run` is not exported, so no external JS
caller can pass a non-integer. It should specialize the entire recursive SCC
to `i32` (or `i64` for larger ranges), eliminating the f64 FPU path entirely.

Currently the compiler produces `fib: (f64) -> f64`. The target is
`fib: (i32) -> i32` (or `i64`) with integer ALU instructions throughout —
no SSE2 float ops, no boxing, direct `i32.add`/`i32.sub`/`i32.le_s`.

## Integer type lattice

The specialization should choose the narrowest safe integer type:

| Type | Max exact value | fib ceiling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| i32 | 2,147,483,647 | fib(46) | Fastest; safe if range proved |
| i64 | 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | fib(92) | More precise than f64 for large ints |
| f64 | 2^53 exact | fib(78) exact | Loses integer precision beyond fib(78) |

For integer arithmetic, i64 is **more precise than f64** for large values.
i32 and i64 have near-identical performance on 64-bit runtimes (both run on
the integer ALU at ~1 cycle latency vs ~3–5 cycles for f64 FPU ops). The real
gain is eliminating float instructions entirely, not just reducing latency.

Note: for recursive fib the function-call overhead dominates, so the arithmetic
speedup is modest (~5–15%). The gain is more pronounced for iterative
integer-heavy loops.

## Strategy

### 1. Call-site constant seeding

Extend the Phase 2 propagation (`src/ir/propagate.ts`) to seed integer type
facts from literal call sites, not just from export boundaries:

```ts
// run(30) — 30 is an integer literal
// seed: run.params[0] = i32 (not just f64)
```

A numeric literal is `i32` if it fits in `[-2^31, 2^31-1]`, otherwise `i64`
if it fits in `[-2^63, 2^63-1]`, otherwise `f64`.

### 2. Closed-world detection

A function is **closed-world** (no external callers) when:
- It is not marked `export`
- It is not passed as a value (not referenced via `ref.func` or stored)
- All call sites are within the same source file

For closed-world functions, call-site seeds are authoritative — no need to
widen to `f64` for the "external caller might pass a float" case.

### 3. Range analysis for recursive SCCs

For a recursive SCC (e.g. `fib`) with an integer-seeded entry:
- Arithmetic ops `+`, `-`, `*` on integer inputs produce integer outputs
- Check: do any values escape the i32 range during recursion?
  - Conservative: use i64 if i32 overflow is possible
  - Precise: for known-constant inputs (e.g. `fib(30)`), prove the output
    range statically (832040 << INT32_MAX → i32 safe)
- If overflow cannot be ruled out, fall back to i64 (not f64 — i64 is both
  faster and more precise for integer arithmetic)

### 4. Export boundary handling

If `run` IS exported (callable from JS), the export boundary coerces:
- JS `number` → f64 at entry, convert to i32/i64 if the internal type is integer
- i32/i64 result → f64 at exit for the JS return value

The internal specialization is unchanged; only the boundary conversion differs.

## Wasm output target

For `fib(30)` with i32 specialization:

```wat
(func $fib (param i32) (result i32)
  local.get 0
  i32.const 1
  i32.le_s
  (if (result i32)
    (then local.get 0)
    (else
      local.get 0
      i32.const 1
      i32.sub
      call $fib          ;; direct i32 recursive call
      local.get 0
      i32.const 2
      i32.sub
      call $fib
      i32.add
    )
  )
)
```

Zero f64 instructions, zero boxing, pure integer ALU.

## Key files

- `src/ir/propagate.ts` — extend to seed integer types from literal call sites
- `src/ir/select.ts` — extend shape check to accept `i32`/`i64` typed functions
- `src/ir/from-ast.ts` — emit `i32`/`i64` const/prim instructions
- `src/ir/lower.ts` — lower `i32`/`i64` IR instructions to Wasm ops
- `src/ir/nodes.ts` — ensure `IrType` covers `i32` and `i64` (may already exist)

## Acceptance criteria

1. `console.log(run(30))` (non-exported `run` calling non-exported `fib`)
   compiles `fib` to `(i32) -> i32` with no f64 instructions in the body
2. `run(50)` compiles to `(i64) -> i64` (output 12,586,269,025 > INT32_MAX)
3. Exported `run` still works from JS — boundary coercion converts f64↔i32/i64
4. Functions where integer proof fails fall through to f64 without error
5. Equivalence test: `run(10) === 55`, `run(30) === 832040`
6. No regressions in `tests/equivalence.test.ts`

## Unblocked (2026-06-12)

Blockers resolved/closed (#1168 done, #1131 closed-superseded). Stays parked in Backlog: perf-family work ranks below the correctness program until value-rep P6 settles the representation it would specialize (07-proposal rule).
