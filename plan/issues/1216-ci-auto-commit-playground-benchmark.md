origin: deferred from #1214 — that PR landed the minimum viable fix (informational gate on PR/push), but the architecturally correct fix is to regenerate the baseline on every push to main and commit it back, so the comparison happens on the same machine type.

# #1216 — Auto-commit playground benchmark baseline on push-to-main

## Context

#1214 landed the immediate fix for the noise-gate problem: the `refresh-benchmarks`
workflow no longer fails on `pull_request` and `push` events even when the diff
reports machine-difference noise. The diff is still computed and printed to the
workflow log informationally, but only `workflow_dispatch` runs are gating.

That fix eliminated the merge-friction (~10 minutes of human-attention per PR
for drift override), but it also weakened the regression-detection signal: a
real wasm performance regression on a PR no longer fails the workflow. The
gate is currently doing nothing useful on PR/push events.

The root cause of the noise is unchanged: the committed baseline at
`benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json` was generated **locally**
on a fast dev machine, while CI runs on shared GitHub Actions runners. Wasm is
~4× slower on CI, JS is ~1.5× slower (the runtimes are NOT proportionally
affected) — so any comparison against the local baseline produces apparent
regressions even from no-op PRs.

## Fix

Add a step to `.github/workflows/benchmark-refresh.yml` that runs only on
`push: main` events: after `refresh:benchmarks` regenerates the sidebar JSON,
commit it back to `main` with `[skip ci]` so subsequent PR runs compare against
a CI-typical baseline.

Pattern is established by:
- `.github/workflows/refresh-committed-baseline.yml` (test262 baseline sync)
- `.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml` `promote-baseline` job (test262
  current json sync)

Both use the same approach: regenerate on CI → commit back with `[skip ci]` to
avoid loops. This proposal applies the same pattern to the playground sidebar.

## Once landed

After the first push-to-main run commits a CI-derived baseline, the
regression-detection step in `benchmark-refresh.yml` can be re-enabled on PR
events. The current "informational on PR/push" mode is preserved as the
escape hatch for cases where CI baselines drift (e.g., a runner-pool change).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `.github/workflows/benchmark-refresh.yml` has a step that, on
  `push: main`, commits `benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json`
  (and the two derived `public/` copies) back to main with `[skip ci]` IF the
  numbers changed.
- [ ] Commit message: e.g., `chore(ci): refresh playground benchmark baseline [skip ci]`.
- [ ] Workflow does NOT loop: the `[skip ci]` tag must work for this repo's CI
  setup (verify against existing `refresh-committed-baseline.yml` pattern).
- [ ] If the regression check on push-to-main reports regressions, the auto-commit
  is **skipped** (don't mask real regressions by promoting the new "regressed"
  numbers as the baseline). Add a guard before the commit step.
- [ ] Re-enable PR-event regression failure on `benchmark-refresh.yml` after the
  first auto-commit lands and the new baseline is verified to match CI runner
  characteristics. Optional sub-task — can be a separate PR.
- [ ] Document the commit-back loop in `CLAUDE.md` "Baseline files" table.

## Implementation notes

The existing `refresh-committed-baseline.yml` is a clean reference: it uses
`actions/checkout@v5` with the default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, `git config user.*`
for the bot identity, and `git diff --quiet` to detect "no changes" before
committing. The same skeleton applies here — just for a different file.

One difference: the test262 baseline sync runs in a **separate workflow** that
downloads artifacts from a finished `Test262 Sharded` run. The playground
benchmark fits inside the existing `benchmark-refresh.yml` (no artifacts to
download — the sidebar JSON is generated in-job).

### Open question

Should we commit the `public/benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json`
copy too, or only the canonical `benchmarks/results/` location? The LFS
migration (#1170, commit `616a7a528`) untracked the `public/` copy
intentionally. Sticking to that decision means: only commit
`benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json` from CI. The `public/`
copy is generated downstream by `build-pages.js` at deploy time.

## Out of scope

- Cross-runtime benchmark suite (Node/Bun/wasmtime variance) — separate concern.
- Per-benchmark variance gating — current 50% ratio threshold is fine once
  baseline is on the same machine.
- Wasm size regression gate — separate from timing; separate issue.
