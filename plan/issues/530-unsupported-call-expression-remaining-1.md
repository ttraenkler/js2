# Unsupported call expression — remaining 1,745 CE

## Problem

1,745 tests fail with "Unsupported call expression". This is the largest remaining CE bucket. These are call patterns the compiler doesn't compile.

## Root Cause Analysis

The `compileCallExpression` function in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` has a final fallback that emits "Unsupported call expression" when no handler matches. Investigation found several common patterns reaching this error:

1. **Union type method calls** (A | B).method() -- receiver type is a union, symbol name is undefined
2. **Interface method calls** -- receiver type is an interface, not in classSet
3. **Abstract class method calls** -- method defined on abstract class, only implemented in subclass
4. **String.prototype.method.call(str, ...)** -- prototype chain method calls
5. **Number.prototype.method.call(num, ...)** -- same for number methods
6. **Promise.then()/catch()** -- method calls on Promise-typed values

## Implementation

### Union type / Interface / Abstract class method dispatch
- Added fallback resolution in the receiverClassName lookup:
  - For union types: iterate members, find first class with the method
  - For interfaces: scan all classes, find one with matching method (structural compatibility check)
  - For abstract classes: walk child classes in classParentMap
  - Try struct name resolution from wasm type
  - Added externref-to-struct coercion when receiver is externref but method expects struct ref

### String.prototype.method.call / Number.prototype.method.call
- Added Case 2a in the `.call()/.apply()` handler to detect `Type.prototype.method.call(receiver, ...args)`
- Rewrites as a synthetic property access call on the receiver: `receiver.method(...args)`
- Updated `collectStringMethodImports` and `collectBuiltinImports` to detect these patterns during import scanning
- Works for String, Number, Array, Boolean prototype methods

### Promise.then() / Promise.catch()
- Added `Promise_then` and `Promise_catch` host imports (2-arg: promise, callback -> promise)
- Added detection in `collectPromiseImports` for `.then()`/`.catch()` on Promise-typed values
- Added handler in property access section to compile these calls
- Added runtime handlers in `src/runtime.ts`

## Files Changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- union/interface/abstract class resolution, prototype.call rewrite, Promise.then/catch handling
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- import detection for String.prototype.call, Number.prototype.call, Promise.then/catch
- `src/runtime.ts` -- Promise_then, Promise_catch runtime handlers
- `tests/issue-530-call-fixes.test.ts` -- 6 new tests covering all fix patterns

## Key files
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- compileCallExpression
