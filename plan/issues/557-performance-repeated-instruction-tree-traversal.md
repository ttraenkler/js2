# Issue #557: Performance -- repeated instruction tree traversal for index shifting

## Problem

`shiftLateImportIndices` and `addUnionImports` repeatedly traverse all function bodies
every time a new import is added. This is O(I * B) where I=imports and B=total body
instructions. When multiple imports are added in sequence (e.g., `__extern_get` then
`__extern_set`), each triggers a full traversal of all compiled function bodies.

## Solution

Batch index shifts by deferring the expensive body traversal:

1. **`ensureLateImport(ctx, name, paramTypes, resultTypes)`** -- adds an import if not
   already present, recording `ctx.pendingLateImportShift.importsBefore` on the first
   deferred addition. Returns the funcIdx immediately (import indices are stable).

2. **`flushLateImportShifts(ctx, fctx)`** -- performs a single O(B) traversal for all
   imports added since the first deferred addition. No-op if no pending shifts.

3. **Batching** -- consecutive `ensureLateImport` calls share one flush. For example,
   adding both `__extern_get` and `__extern_set` now does 1 traversal instead of 2.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added `pendingLateImportShift` field to `CodegenContext` interface and both init sites
- Created `ensureLateImport()` helper that adds imports without immediate traversal
- Created `flushLateImportShifts()` that does a single deferred traversal
- Replaced all 13 `shiftLateImportIndices` call sites with `ensureLateImport` + `flushLateImportShifts`
- Batched consecutive import additions (e.g., __extern_get + __extern_set) into single flush

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- added `ensureLateImport`, `flushLateImportShifts`; replaced 13 call sites
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- added `pendingLateImportShift` field to CodegenContext

### What worked
- The batching mechanism correctly handles import index stability (imports are appended, not inserted)
- Consecutive imports in the same code path share a single traversal
- `addUnionImports` kept its own shift logic (already internally batched for 9 imports)

### Tests
- All existing tests pass (no regressions)
- Pre-existing failures remain unchanged
