# #953 — Add Wasm validation pass to compilation tests

## Problem

The compiler can produce invalid Wasm binaries that only fail at `WebAssembly.instantiate()` time. We currently don't validate the binary before instantiation, so invalid output is reported as a runtime error rather than caught at compile time.

## Fix

Add a `WebAssembly.validate(binary)` call after every successful compilation in:

1. **Equivalence test helpers** (`tests/equivalence/helpers.ts` — `compileToWasm()`) — validate before instantiate
2. **Test262 worker** (`scripts/test262-worker.mjs`) — validate after compile, before execute
3. **Compiler output** (`src/compiler.ts`) — optionally validate as part of `compile()` return, or as a separate `validateOutput` flag
4. **CLI** (`src/cli.ts`) — validate before writing to disk

If `WebAssembly.validate()` returns false, report it as a compile error with "invalid Wasm binary" message, not a runtime error.

## Acceptance criteria

- All equiv tests validate binary before instantiation
- Test262 worker validates binary — invalid Wasm reported as CE, not runtime error
- CLI validates output before writing
- No valid programs produce invalid Wasm (if they do, that's a compiler bug to fix)
