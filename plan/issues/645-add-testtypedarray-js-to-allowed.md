# #645 — Add testTypedArray.js to allowed includes (1,731 skip)

## Status: open

1,731 tests are skipped because testTypedArray.js is not in the allowed includes set. TypedArray support was added in #608. The include should be allowed and the helper functions stubbed or stripped.

### Fix
In tests/test262-runner.ts, add "testTypedArray.js" to the allowed includes set. Strip or stub its helper functions (testWithTypedArrayConstructors, etc.).

## Complexity: S
