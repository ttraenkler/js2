origin: surfaced 2026-04-27 during a test262-runtime parallelism analysis. The 9-fork CompilerPool is fully saturated, but 136 tests hit the 30 s `compile_timeout` ceiling each run, adding ~7.6 min of wall-clock at 9-way parallelism — roughly doubling the total run time.

# #1207 — Root-cause the 136 test262 `compile_timeout` tests

## Problem

The current test262 baseline (`benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl`,
43,168 tests) shows **136 tests with `status: compile_timeout`**. Each
of these occupies a CompilerPool fork for the full 30 s timeout
ceiling — that's:

- 4,080 fork-seconds of wasted compile time per run
- ~**7.6 minutes** of additional wall-clock at 9-way parallelism
- Roughly doubles the total wall-clock run time (healthy work is ~7-8 min)

A separate observation that strengthens this issue: the per-test
compile-time distribution is **bimodal** — almost every test compiles
in well under 1 second, and the tail jumps straight to the 30 s
timeout wall. There are zero compiles in the 1-30 s range. That
suggests the timeouts are not "naturally slow tests" but **specific
compiler bugs** (infinite loops in codegen, exponential backtracking,
quadratic behaviour in some pass) that hang indefinitely until the
pool kills them.

## Implementation plan

### Phase 1 — bucket the 136

Run a one-off analysis script that:

1. Reads `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl`
2. Filters to `status: compile_timeout`
3. Groups by path prefix (e.g. `language/expressions/async-arrow`,
   `built-ins/RegExp/prototype/exec`)
4. For each top bucket (>5 tests), pick a representative file and
   manually compile it with a 60 s ceiling and `--profile` / Node
   inspector to see where time is spent

Output: `plan/notes/test262-timeout-clusters.md` listing the buckets,
representative files, and likely root-cause hypothesis per bucket.

### Phase 2 — fix the root causes (separate issues per cluster)

Most likely the 136 timeouts cluster into 5-15 distinct compiler
bugs. Examples of common patterns this typically surfaces:

- **Exponential blow-up in regex compilation**: complex regex literal
  triggers an O(2^n) state explosion in NFA construction.
- **Infinite loop in fixpoint passes**: dead-code, type-narrowing, or
  late-import shifts that don't reach a fixpoint on certain shapes.
- **Quadratic-or-worse rewriting**: a pass that walks the AST and
  also walks each node's body for each visit (n³ or worse on deeply
  nested code).
- **Regex / state-machine recursion** in early-error detection.

For each cluster identified in Phase 1, file a separate sprint issue
with the failing pattern + the proposed fix. Most fixes are local to
one pass / one function — typical effort 1-2 days each.

### Phase 3 — tighten the timeout ceiling once the bugs are fixed

After the root causes are addressed, drop the timeout from 30 s to
10 s in `tests/test262-shared.ts` and `scripts/compiler-pool.ts`.
The bimodal distribution means a 10 s ceiling catches the same hangs
without losing any honest work. Save the wall-clock cost on regressions
that re-introduce hangs (they'd be caught faster).

This phase only lands once Phase 2 has eliminated the legitimate
30 s outliers, otherwise we'd just convert 30 s timeouts into 10 s
timeouts without saving the underlying work.

### Out of scope (already documented elsewhere or separate issue)

- **Caching known-timeout tests** (skip them by default, hit only on
  `--recheck`) — discussed in the analysis but is a workaround, not a
  fix. If we ship caching, we mask regressions. Phase 2 is the right
  fix; defer caching unless Phase 2 gets stuck.
- **Pipelining compile↔execute within a fork** — separate parallelism
  win; orthogonal to this issue.
- **Sharding across multiple vitest forks** — separate parallelism
  win; orthogonal.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Phase 1 deliverable**: `plan/notes/test262-timeout-clusters.md`
   listing the 5-15 distinct buckets, representative files, and
   per-bucket hypothesis.
2. **Phase 2 deliverable**: ≥80% of the 136 timeouts fixed (target
   ≤30 timeouts remaining). Each cluster fixed via its own follow-up
   issue with a regression test.
3. **Phase 3 deliverable**: timeout ceiling lowered from 30 s to 10 s
   in `tests/test262-shared.ts` and `scripts/compiler-pool.ts`.
4. **Wall-clock impact**: full local test262 run drops from
   ~14-16 min to ~8-10 min. Verifiable via `time pnpm run test:262`
   before and after.
5. CI test262 net delta ≥ 0 — all 136 tests previously hitting
   `compile_timeout` now show their *actual* result (likely a mix of
   pass / fail / compile_error). Net `compile_timeout` count drops
   to ≤30.

## Reproducer / measurement

Today's data point (43,168 tests, baseline `2d5b69d54`):

| Status | Count | % |
|---|---:|---:|
| pass | 25,387 | 58.8% |
| fail | 13,913 | 32.2% |
| compile_error | 2,393 | 5.5% |
| skip | 1,339 | 3.1% |
| **compile_timeout** | **136** | **0.3%** |

Cost: 136 × 30 s / 9 forks = **453 s = 7.6 min wall-clock added per run**.

To reproduce the bucketing analysis:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json
from collections import Counter
buckets = Counter()
with open('benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl') as f:
    for line in f:
        d = json.loads(line)
        if d.get('status') == 'compile_timeout':
            buckets['/'.join(d['file'].split('/')[:5])] += 1
for path, n in buckets.most_common():
    print(f"{n:4d}  {path}")
PY
```

## Notes

This is the third item on the test262-parallelism analysis (the first
two were "the 9-fork pool is correctly parallel" — confirmed — and
"compile↔exec pipelining within each fork" — separate issue). Of the
three, **this one has the highest wall-clock leverage on local test262
runs today**: roughly halves the time. Filed as `priority: high` for
sprint 47.

The fixes are also intrinsically valuable beyond the wall-clock win:
each cluster represents a real compiler bug that can hang on
adversarial input. Fixing them improves the compiler's robustness,
not just its CI throughput.

## Phase 1 outcome (2026-05-01)

The phase-1 deliverable lives at
[`plan/notes/test262-timeout-clusters.md`](../../../notes/test262-timeout-clusters.md).
That note now carries an `Update 2026-05-01` section at the top with the
final Phase-1 finding.

Headline result: with the iter-close cluster fixed in a prior PR, **the
remaining 156 reported `compile_timeout` entries are not compiler bugs**.
A single-threaded isolation probe over all 156 (script:
`.tmp/probe-all-timeouts.mts`) compiles them in **31.6 s total wall-clock**
(max individual compile: 553 ms). 134 succeed; the other 22 are legitimate
sub-second `compile_error`s. None genuinely time out.

Root cause: `scripts/compiler-pool.ts:195` starts the timeout timer at
*enqueue* time, so jobs queued behind a saturated pool accumulate wall-clock
against a timer that fires before the worker ever picks them up.

This changes the planned Phase 2 / Phase 3 work:

- **Phase 2 (5–15 separate cluster fixes) is no longer applicable.** The
  clusters aren't real compiler bugs; they're queue-ordering artefacts.
  The original cluster table in this issue (Array, TypedArray, Object,
  RegExp, …) is preserved in the notes file as historical context.
- **A new follow-up should be filed (e.g. `#1207a`)** to move the timer
  creation from `enqueue` into `dispatch` in `compiler-pool.ts` — a
  one-spot change. After it lands and the next baseline refresh runs,
  the `compile_timeout` count is expected to drop into the single
  digits (only tests that genuinely loop or backtrack inside the
  compiler, if any).
- **Phase 3 (lower the 30 s ceiling to 10 s) becomes safe** once the
  dispatch-time-timer fix has landed, since real isolated compile times
  are all <1 s.

This PR (#1207 worktree `issue-1207-timeout-clusters`) lands only the
Phase 1 analysis update. The runner fix and the timeout reduction will
land in dedicated follow-ups so each carries its own regression test
and CI baseline diff.
