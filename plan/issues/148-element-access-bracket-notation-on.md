# Issue #148: Element access (bracket notation) on struct types

## Status: Done

## Problem
96 test262 compile errors: "Element access on struct type '__anon_0'".
Tests use `obj["key"]` where `obj` is an object literal (struct) and `key` is a string literal.
The compiler only supported dot notation (`obj.key`) on structs.

## Solution
For string-literal bracket access (`obj["prop"]`), desugar to struct field access at compile time:

1. **Read path** (`compileElementAccess`): When a non-vec, non-tuple struct is accessed with a string literal key, look up the field by name in `typeDef.fields` and emit `struct.get`.

2. **Write path** (`compileElementAssignment`): When assigning to a struct via string literal bracket notation (`obj["prop"] = value`), look up the field and emit `struct.set`.

Dynamic string keys remain unsupported (would require hashmap fallback from #130 Phase 4).

## Files Changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — `compileElementAccess` and `compileElementAssignment`
