# #714 — Conformance progress graph: track pass/fail/CE over time

## Status: done

## Problem

We have no persistent visualization of how test262 conformance changes across sessions. Each run overwrites `test262-report.json` and `test262-results.jsonl`. Individual run snapshots exist in `benchmarks/results/runs/` but there's no chart showing the trend.

Key milestones we should be able to see:
- Sprint 1: 550 → 1,509 pass
- Sprint 2-3: incremental improvements
- 2026-03-19 session: major jump (53 issues)
- 2026-03-21 session: 15,232 pass baseline → post-fixes

## Requirements

1. **Auto-archive**: each test262 run saves a timestamped `{timestamp}-report.json` to `benchmarks/results/runs/` (already partially done)
2. **Historical index**: `benchmarks/results/runs/index.json` — array of `{timestamp, pass, fail, ce, skip, total, gitHash}` entries, appended after each run
3. **Trend chart**: `benchmarks/results/report.html` includes a line chart (Chart.js or similar) showing pass/fail/CE counts over time
4. **Annotations**: mark key events (sprint boundaries, major fixes) on the chart
5. **Comparison**: ability to diff any two runs side-by-side (category-level deltas)

## Approach

1. At end of `run-test262-vitest.sh` or in `afterAll` of `test262-vitest.test.ts`, append to `runs/index.json`
2. Add a `<canvas>` chart to `report.html` that reads `runs/index.json` and plots the trend
3. Store git short hash with each entry for traceability

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
1. **Historical index file** (`benchmarks/results/runs/index.json`): Array of `{timestamp, pass, fail, ce, skip, total, gitHash}` entries, one per run.
2. **Auto-append after each run**: Modified `afterAll` in `tests/test262-vitest.test.ts` to read `runs/index.json`, append the current run's stats + git hash, and write back. Creates the file if missing.
3. **Seed script** (`scripts/seed-index.ts`): Parses all existing `*-report.json` files in `runs/`, filters out partial runs (total < 20k), deduplicates same-stats entries, and writes the initial `index.json`. 15 historical data points recovered.
4. **Trend chart** (`benchmarks/results/report.html`): Self-contained HTML dashboard with:
   - Summary stat cards (pass/fail/CE/skip/rate) with deltas from previous run
   - Inline SVG stacked area + line chart showing pass/fail/CE counts and pass rate % over time
   - Interactive tooltips on hover showing full stats per data point
   - Run history table (newest first) with delta indicators

### What worked
- Pure inline SVG approach -- no external dependencies (Chart.js, etc.)
- Dual Y-axes: left for absolute counts, right for pass rate percentage
- Stacked areas give visual sense of total test suite growth
- Seeding from existing reports gives immediate historical context

### Files changed
- `tests/test262-vitest.test.ts` -- afterAll appends to `runs/index.json`
- `benchmarks/results/report.html` -- new trend dashboard
- `benchmarks/results/runs/index.json` -- new historical index (seeded with 15 entries)
- `scripts/seed-index.ts` -- new one-time seed script
