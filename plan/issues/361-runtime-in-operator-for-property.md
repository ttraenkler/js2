# Issue #361: Runtime `in` operator for property checks

## Problem
21 test262 tests were being skipped because they use the `in` operator for runtime property existence checks. The skip filter in test262-runner.ts was blocking these tests from even being attempted.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
The codegen already had a complete implementation for the `in` operator (from issue #291 and subsequent work):
- Static key checks against struct field names
- TypeScript type system property lookup (including apparent types / prototype methods)
- Array index bounds checks
- Dynamic key runtime string comparison against known fields
- Comma expression and parenthesized expression handling

The remaining work was:
1. **Removed the test262 skip filter** in `tests/test262-runner.ts` that was preventing 21 tests from being attempted
2. **Added 6 new equivalence tests** in `tests/equivalence/in-operator-edge-cases.test.ts` covering missing properties, array bounds, class instances, logical operators, and negation

### Files changed
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` — Removed `in` operator skip filter
- `tests/equivalence/in-operator-edge-cases.test.ts` — Added 6 new equivalence tests

### Tests passing
- All 28 `in` operator tests pass (9 equivalence + 19 issue-361)
- No regressions in equivalence test suite
