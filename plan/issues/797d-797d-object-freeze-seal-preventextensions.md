# #797d -- Object.freeze/seal/preventExtensions compile-away

## Implementation summary

Object.freeze, Object.seal, and Object.preventExtensions are compiled away at compile time. When the compiler detects these calls on a known struct type, it updates the static descriptor table (#797a) and emits TypeError throws for subsequent writes to frozen/sealed fields. Zero runtime overhead -- no flags checked at runtime. Key principle: compile away, don't emulate.
