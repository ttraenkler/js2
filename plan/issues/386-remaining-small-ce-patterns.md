# #386 -- Remaining small CE patterns

## Status: open

Catch-all for compile error patterns with 1-3 occurrences each, totaling approximately 200 tests. Also includes 5 runtime failures from misc patterns.

## Details

Known sub-patterns:

- **4 tests**: "No dependency provided for extern class __func" -- missing function type dependency
- **1 test**: "new Array(): invalid vec type" -- Array constructor with non-standard element type
- **1 test**: "Codegen error: sig.params is not iterable" -- function signature resolution failure
- **1 test**: "Duplicate function implementation" -- function overload/redeclaration
- **~190 tests**: Various one-off compile errors including:
  - Type resolution failures for complex expressions
  - Unsupported syntax combinations
  - Edge cases in generic type inference
  - Property access on unresolved types
  - Computed property names in various contexts
  - Template literal type errors
  - Optional chaining edge cases
  - Nullish coalescing with non-standard types

Each individual pattern is too small to warrant a dedicated issue but collectively they represent a significant number of test improvements.

## Complexity: XL (many independent fixes)

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] At least 50% of the ~200 compile errors are resolved
- [ ] No regressions in existing tests
- [ ] Each fix is documented in implementation notes
- [ ] Patterns with 3+ occurrences are prioritized
