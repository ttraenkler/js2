# #491 — Remove stale unary +/- null/undefined skip filter (480 tests)

## Status: open

480 tests skipped for "unary +/- on null/undefined" but #348 already fixed this. The skip filter is stale and should be removed or significantly narrowed.

## Approach

1. Remove or narrow the skip filter in test262-runner.ts
2. Run the tests — most should pass or fail with specific errors (not compiler hangs)
3. Create follow-up issues for any new failure patterns discovered

This is purely a skip filter cleanup — no compiler changes needed.

## Complexity: XS

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Skip filter removed
- [ ] Tests that now pass are counted
- [ ] Any remaining failures have specific issues filed
