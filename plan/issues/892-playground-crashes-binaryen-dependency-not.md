# #892 — Playground crashes: binaryen dependency not resolved by Vite

## Status: open

## Problem

Running the playground with `vite dev` fails:

```
Error: The following dependencies are imported but could not be resolved:
  binaryen (imported by /workspace/src/optimize.ts)
Are they installed?
```

`binaryen` is a Node.js-only dependency used by the optimizer (`src/optimize.ts`). Vite can't bundle it for the browser. This is the same pattern we already fixed for `fs`, `path`, `module`, and `url` in #679.

## Fix

Either:
1. Add `binaryen` to Vite's `optimizeDeps.exclude` and `build.rollupOptions.external`
2. Or lazy-load binaryen in `src/optimize.ts` using the same `eval('require')` pattern used in `src/checker/index.ts`

Option 2 is preferred since it matches the existing pattern and makes the optimizer truly optional.
