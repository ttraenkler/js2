# #877 -- Agile criteria — Definition of Ready, Definition of Done, velocity tracking

## Problem

Agile criteria are scattered across multiple checklists and agent definitions. Need canonical definitions and velocity tracking.

## Tasks

### 1. Definition of Done (single canonical list)
Create `plan/method/definition-of-done.md`:
- [ ] Smoke-test verified issue is real
- [ ] Code implemented on feature branch
- [ ] Equivalence tests pass (no regressions)
- [ ] Issue-specific test262 tests pass (X/Y recorded)
- [ ] Branch integrated with main (`git merge main`)
- [ ] Merged to main (`git merge --ff-only`)
- [ ] Issue file has `## Test Results` with pass counts
- [ ] Issue moved to `plan/issues/done/`
- [ ] Dependency graph updated
- [ ] Sprint doc updated

### 2. Definition of Ready (when is an issue ready for dev?)
Create `plan/method/definition-of-ready.md`:
- [ ] Sample test files listed with exact errors
- [ ] Root cause identified (which codegen function)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined (target pass count)
- [ ] Feasibility assessed (easy/medium/hard)
- [ ] If hard: architect spec written (`## Implementation Plan`)
- [ ] No unresolved dependencies
- [ ] Smoke-tested against current main (confirmed still broken)

### 3. Velocity tracking
Add to each sprint doc:
- Issues closed (count)
- CE fixed (count)
- FAIL fixed (count)
- Stale issues caught (count)
- Sprint duration (hours or sessions)
- Compare to previous sprint

## Acceptance criteria
- Both definitions exist as standalone files
- Sprint-31 doc has velocity section
- Developer.md references both definitions
