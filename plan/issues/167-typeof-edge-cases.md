# #167 — typeof edge cases

## Status: done

## Problem
`typeof null` returned "number" instead of "object", and `typeof undefined` returned "number" instead of "undefined". This happened because:
- `null` (TypeFlags.Null) maps to externref via `mapTsTypeToWasm`, falling through to the `__typeof` host import path (worked but was unnecessary overhead)
- `undefined` (TypeFlags.Undefined) maps to i32 via `mapTsTypeToWasm`, so `compileTypeofExpression` returned "number" for i32 types

Similarly, `typeof null === "object"` and `typeof undefined === "undefined"` comparisons failed because `compileTypeofComparison` did not check for Null/Undefined type flags before resolving wasm types.

## Fix
- Added early checks for `TypeFlags.Null` and `TypeFlags.Undefined`/`TypeFlags.Void` in both `compileTypeofExpression` and `compileTypeofComparison`, before the wasm type mapping that loses this information
- `typeof null` now statically resolves to "object"
- `typeof undefined` now statically resolves to "undefined"

## Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — `compileTypeofExpression` and `compileTypeofComparison`

## Complexity: XS
