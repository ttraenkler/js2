# #180 — JS var re-declaration: "Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type"

## Status: in-review
## Summary
26 test262 compile errors from TypeScript rejecting `var` re-declarations with different inferred types. In JavaScript, `var x = 1; var x = "hello";` is legal but TypeScript rejects it when the types differ.

## Motivation
26 test262 compile errors across multiple categories. Pattern: tests that declare `var x = someNumber` then later `var x = someString` or re-declare with a different expression type.

This is a TypeScript strictness issue in allowJs mode.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/index.ts` or TypeScript configuration — need to suppress TS2403 in allowJs mode
- Alternatively, the test262 wrapper could pre-process to remove duplicate `var` declarations

## Complexity
S

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `var x = 1; var x = "hello";` compiles without error in allowJs mode
- [ ] 26 test262 compile errors fixed

## Implementation notes
- Added TS2403 to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` in `src/compiler.ts`
- This downgrades the "Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type" error to a warning
- The codegen already handles mixed-type variables gracefully via externref
