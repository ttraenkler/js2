# [ts2wasm] Codegen: Unused `$AnyValue` preamble type + duplicate export for `main`

## Summary

Compiling a minimal TypeScript module emits two codegen issues in the resulting WAT:
1. The `$AnyValue` struct type is unconditionally emitted even when the module contains no `any`-typed values.
2. The exported function `main` is exported twice — once inline and once via a trailing `(export ...)` declaration — resulting in a duplicate export entry.

## Reproduction

**Input (`input.ts`):**
```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

export function main() {
  add(3, 2);
}
```

**Output (compiled `.wat`):**
```wat
(module
  (type $AnyValue (struct (field $tag i32) (field $i32val i32) (field $f64val f64) (field $refval eqref) (field $externval externref)))
  (type $add_type (func (param f64 f64) (result f64)))
  (type $main_type (func))
  (func $add (type 1)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.add
    return
  )
  (func $main (export "main") (type 2)
    f64.const 3
    f64.const 2
    call 0
    drop
  )
  (export "main" (func 1))
)
```

## Issue 1: Unconditional `$AnyValue` Preamble Emission

### Problem

`$AnyValue` is emitted as `type index 0` in every compiled module regardless of whether `any` appears anywhere in the source. In this module:
- No local, parameter, or return type references `$AnyValue`
- No `struct.new`, `struct.get`, or `struct.set` instructions reference it
- It occupies type index 0, shifting all other type indices up by 1

This causes unnecessary binary size overhead and pollutes the type section of every module.

### Root Cause

The `$AnyValue` struct is likely emitted unconditionally as part of a global module preamble during code generation, before any type-usage analysis is performed.

### Expected Behavior

`$AnyValue` should only be emitted when at least one value of type `any` (or a type that resolves to `any`) is present in the compiled module.

### Fix

Add a **type usage tracking pass** before emitting the type section. Only emit `$AnyValue` if the flag is set during IR lowering.

**Pseudocode:**
```typescript
// In the compiler's emission phase
if (moduleContext.usesAnyType) {
  emitAnyValueStructType();
}
```

Alternatively, run a **dead type elimination pass** over the collected type definitions before serializing the WAT/Wasm binary, dropping any types not referenced by a function signature, local, or instruction.

## Issue 2: Duplicate `"main"` Export

### Problem

The `main` function is exported twice under the same name `"main"`:

```wat
(func $main (export "main") (type 2)  ;; inline export — func index 1
  ...
)
(export "main" (func 1))              ;; trailing export — also func index 1
```

Both entries point to the same function. While this may not cause a runtime error (the second entry overwrites the first in most runtimes), it is:
- Technically invalid per the Wasm spec (duplicate export names are rejected by validators)
- A reliable signal of a codegen bug where two separate export-emission paths fire for the same function

### Root Cause

Export emission likely happens in two places:
1. Inline, when the function itself is emitted (triggered by `export` in the TS source)
2. Again in a separate trailing export collection pass that does not check for already-emitted exports

### Expected Behavior

`"main"` should appear exactly once in the export section.

### Fix

Choose **one canonical export emission strategy** and remove the other:

**Option A — Inline only (preferred for readability):**
Remove the trailing export collection pass for functions that were already exported inline.

**Option B — Trailing section only (preferred for separation of concerns):**
Do not emit inline `(export ...)` on function definitions. Collect all exports and emit them once as a dedicated export section at the end of the module.

Either way, add a **duplicate export guard** as a safety net:

```typescript
const emittedExports = new Set<string>();

function emitExport(name: string, funcIndex: number) {
  if (emittedExports.has(name)) {
    throw new Error(`Duplicate export: "${name}" (func ${funcIndex})`);
  }
  emittedExports.add(name);
  // ... emit
}
```

---

## Expected Output

For the given input, the correct WAT should be:

```wat
(module
  (type $add_type (func (param f64 f64) (result f64)))
  (type $main_type (func))
  (func $add (type 0)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.add
    return
  )
  (func $main (type 1)
    f64.const 3
    f64.const 2
    call 0
    drop
  )
  (export "main" (func 1))
)
```

Changes vs. current output:
- `$AnyValue` removed (not used)
- `$add` now correctly references `type 0` (index shifts down by 1)
- `$main` has no inline export; single trailing export retained
- `$main` correctly references `type 1`

## Checklist

- [x] Gate `$AnyValue` emission on lazy registration (ensureAnyValueType)
- [x] Decide on canonical export emission strategy: trailing only
- [x] Remove inline export from WAT emitter

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
1. **Lazy AnyValue registration**: Converted `registerAnyValueType` (unconditional, called at module init) to `ensureAnyValueType` (lazy, called on first use). The function is now exported and called from:
   - `ensureAnyHelpers()` — before emitting boxing/unboxing helper functions
   - `tsTypeToValType()` — when an `any`/`unknown` type is encountered in fast mode
2. **Duplicate export fix**: Removed inline `(export "name")` from WAT function definitions in `src/emit/wat.ts`. Exports are now emitted solely via `mod.exports` (trailing export section), which is the canonical source used by both WAT and binary emitters.

### What worked
- The existing `anyValueTypeIdx = -1` sentinel and `>= 0` guards throughout expressions.ts meant no other code paths needed updating for the lazy pattern.
- All 26 equivalence tests, 17 gradual-typing tests, 16 class/string/module tests pass.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — `registerAnyValueType` -> `ensureAnyValueType` (lazy, exported); removed two unconditional calls; added lazy call in `tsTypeToValType`
- `src/emit/wat.ts` — removed inline export string from `formatFunction`
