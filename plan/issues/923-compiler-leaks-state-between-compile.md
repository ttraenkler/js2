# #923 — Compiler leaks state between compile() calls in the same process

## Problem

When `compile()` is called multiple times in the same Node process, later compilations produce different (incorrect) results compared to calling `compile()` in a fresh process.

### Evidence

Switching equivalence tests from a single persistent vitest fork (all 160 test files in one process) to fork-per-file (each file gets a fresh process) changed results from **999 pass / 226 fail** to **1,156 pass / 68 fail** — a delta of **+157 pass**.

This means 157 tests fail only because the compiler accumulated state from prior `compile()` calls. Examples:

- `regexp-methods.test.ts`: 3/16 pass → 16/16 pass (RegExp host imports were stale from prior compilations)
- Multiple other test files that depend on correct import registration, type caches, or extern class state

### Root cause (suspected)

Module-level mutable state in the compiler that persists across `compile()` calls:

1. **Type/struct registries** — `src/codegen/registry/types.ts` and `src/codegen/registry/imports.ts` may retain type indices or import mappings from prior compilations
2. **Extern class cache** — `ctx.externClasses` is built from lib .d.ts files; if the scanner caches results at module scope, later compilations see stale entries
3. **String pool / function map** — global or module-scoped maps that aren't reset between calls
4. **TypeScript compiler host** — `ts.createCompilerHost()` or `ts.createSourceFile()` may cache file contents at module scope

### How to diagnose

1. Run a failing test in isolation → passes
2. Run the same test after compiling 50+ other files in the same process → fails
3. Bisect: find the minimum set of prior compilations that trigger the failure
4. Inspect module-scoped `let`/`var` declarations in `src/codegen/index.ts`, `src/codegen/expressions.ts`, `src/compiler.ts` for state that survives across `compile()` calls

### Acceptance criteria

- `compile()` is idempotent: calling it N times in the same process produces the same result as N fresh processes
- Equivalence test results are identical with `singleFork: true` and `singleFork: false`
- No module-scoped mutable state leaks between compilations (or it's explicitly reset)

### Workaround

The fork-per-file vitest config (`singleFork: false` in vitest.config.ts) avoids the bug by giving each test file a clean process. This is the current configuration.

### Impact

This bug means any application that calls `compile()` multiple times (e.g., a language server, a watch-mode builder, a REPL) will produce progressively more incorrect output. Critical for production use.

## Investigation Results (2026-04-04)

### Verification: original delta is ZERO on current main

Ran equivalence tests in both modes on current main (commit f36951bf):
- `singleFork=true`: **1131 pass / 93 fail**
- `singleFork=false`: **1131 pass / 93 fail**
- **Delta: 0** — failure lists are identical

The original 157-test delta has already been resolved by prior fixes (likely `resetCompileDepth()` in compiler.ts:2810).

### Comprehensive audit of module-scoped mutable state in `src/`

**Safe (correct caches / one-time initialization):**
- `LIB_FILES` (checker/index.ts:100) — idempotent lib content cache, values never change
- `LIB_SOURCE_FILES` (checker/index.ts:219) — idempotent SourceFile cache, same content per key
- `_tsLibDir` (checker/index.ts:58) — lazy filesystem path resolution, immutable after first set
- `shared.ts` delegates (`_compileExpression`, `_coerceType`, etc.) — one-time dependency injection, set at module load
- `_nodeImports`, `_binaryenModulePromise` (optimize.ts) — lazy Node.js imports, stateless
- `_fs` (resolve.ts) — lazy fs import, stateless
- `__compileDepth` (expressions.ts:558) — already reset via `resetCompileDepth()` at each `compileSource()` call

**Fixed (defensive, no observable correctness impact):**
- `_ensureStructPending` (codegen/index.ts:8967) — module-scoped `WeakSet<ts.Type>` that accumulated entries across compilations. Moved to `ctx.ensureStructPending` (per-compilation `Set<ts.Type>`). While ts.Type objects are fresh per-program (so entries from prior compilations didn't cause false positives), the WeakSet was a memory leak and violated the stateless contract.

### Related: #943 test262 variance

The test262 1,400+ pass variance is **not a compiler state issue**. Since compile() produces deterministic output across calls, the variance comes from the test262 runner: memory pressure causing worker timeouts, stale disk cache, and GC pressure under constrained environments.

## Test Results

10/10 idempotency tests pass (tests/issue-923.test.ts):
- WAT identity across consecutive compiles
- Binary identity across consecutive compiles
- 10 consecutive compiles produce identical output
- Different sources interleaved don't affect subsequent compiles
- RegExp compilation idempotent
- Class compilation idempotent with interleaving
- Errors don't accumulate
- String pool doesn't leak
- Import descriptors don't leak
- 50 mixed compilations produce stable output
