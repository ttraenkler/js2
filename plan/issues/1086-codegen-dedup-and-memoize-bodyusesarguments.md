# #1086 — Dedup + memoize `bodyUsesArguments`

## Problem

`bodyUsesArguments` exists in two byte-identical copies:

- `src/codegen/function-body.ts` (canonical-feeling, exported)
- `src/codegen/statements/nested-declarations.ts` (local copy added in
  a1ba0f23)

Both are called from a total of **6 call sites** across 5 files:

| File | Line | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `src/codegen/function-body.ts` | 297 | Top-level function body |
| `src/codegen/declarations.ts` | 1823 | Module-level declaration compile |
| `src/codegen/literals.ts` | 921, 1009 | Object-literal methods |
| `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts` | 338, 1082 | Class methods |
| `src/codegen/statements/nested-declarations.ts` | 206, 253, 412 | Nested function declarations |

PR #96 (commit a1ba0f23, #1053 arguments-length fix) added the three
call sites in `nested-declarations.ts`. This introduced a hidden **O(N²)
re-walk** pattern: for a source file with N nested function
declarations, each declaration compile triggers a full-subtree walk via
`bodyUsesArguments`, and the enclosing compile also walks the entire body
including all its nested declarations. Work scales as the sum of subtree
sizes, not the tree size.

The #1085 emergency fix converted both copies to iterative DFS to stop
the stack-depth crash under CI cgroup stack limits. It deliberately did
**not** deduplicate or memoize — those are perf fixes, not crash fixes,
and widening scope during an emergency patch was the wrong risk trade.

This issue cleans up the duplication and collapses the O(N²) re-walk to
O(N).

## Fix plan

1. **Extract to a shared helper**:
   ```
   src/codegen/helpers/body-uses-arguments.ts
   ```
   Contents: the iterative-DFS version from #1085, plus a module-level
   `WeakMap<ts.Node, boolean>` memo cache. No ctx threading — WeakMap
   entries die with the `ts.Node` keys when the incremental TS compiler
   discards the program, so no explicit reset is needed.

2. **Delete** both existing copies in `function-body.ts` and
   `nested-declarations.ts`.

3. **Update all 6 call sites** to import from the helper.

4. **Update** `src/codegen/statements.ts:56` re-export to point at the
   helper.

5. **Sanity-check for circular imports**: the helper file should import
   only from `typescript` (for `ts.Node`, `ts.isIdentifier`, etc.) and
   have no outgoing imports to other `src/codegen/` modules. That makes
   it safely importable from anywhere.

## Why not cache on `CodegenContext`

dev-1053's original fold-in proposal used `ctx.bodyUsesArgumentsCache: WeakMap<ts.Node, boolean>`
threaded through the function signature. Module-level WeakMap is equally
correct and requires no call-site signature changes. Trade-off analysis:

- **Module-level WeakMap**:
  - (+) Zero call-site changes beyond the import
  - (+) Same GC behavior — keys die with TS nodes regardless
  - (−) Cache persists across compiles for as long as the TS program does
- **Ctx-level WeakMap**:
  - (+) Explicit per-compile reset
  - (−) Requires ctx threading through 6 call sites

Module-level wins on scope minimization. The only risk would be if two
different compiles somehow shared `ts.Node` identities for DIFFERENT
semantic meanings — not possible, because node identity is stable per
TS-program.

## Memoization effect

For a typical nested-function-heavy test262 file (~50 nested decls,
average body AST depth ~20):

- Pre-#96 behavior: bodyUsesArguments called ~50 times at compile time
- Post-#96 (current): bodyUsesArguments called ~50 times, each walking
  up to the full depth of its subtree → O(N²) node visits total
- Post-#1085 (emergency fix): same ~50 calls, each iterative but not
  memoized → O(N²) node visits total, with O(1) JS stack frames per call
- Post-#1086 (this issue): first call walks, subsequent calls hit the
  cache → O(N) total node visits

Not a crash savings — #1085 already stops the crash — but a meaningful
compile-time speedup on deeply nested inputs, and the right end state
for the codebase.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `src/codegen/helpers/body-uses-arguments.ts` exists with the
      iterative-DFS implementation + module-level `WeakMap<ts.Node, boolean>`
      memo cache
- [ ] Both existing copies deleted from `function-body.ts` and
      `nested-declarations.ts`
- [ ] All 6 call sites updated to import from the helper
- [ ] `src/codegen/statements.ts` re-export updated
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean
- [ ] `npm test -- tests/issue-1053.test.ts` → 9/9 pass
- [ ] `npm test -- tests/equivalence.test.ts` → no new failures vs main
- [ ] PR CI on the sharded baseline shows no regressions vs. post-#1085
      pass count

## Dependencies

- Depends on **#1085** — the emergency iterative-DFS rewrite must land
  first. This issue builds on that rewrite by extracting and memoizing.

## Risks

- **Circular-import trap** (the original reason we didn't dedup in
  #1085): mitigated by putting the helper in a new `src/codegen/helpers/`
  subdirectory with no outgoing imports to other codegen modules.
- **WeakMap key identity across incremental compiles**: ts.Node identity
  is stable for the lifetime of a ts.Program. When the TS program is
  discarded between compiles, the nodes die and WeakMap entries with
  them. No explicit reset needed. Verified by the semantics of WeakMap
  + TS's node-identity guarantees.

## Notes

- Audit trail: follow-up to #1085 emergency fix, agreed between dev-1031
  and dev-1053 on 2026-04-11 after dev-1053 proposed folding dedup+memo
  into the emergency PR. Team-lead approved the split.
- Good first-issue candidate for context transfer: any dev who wants to
  build context on the #96 → #1085 investigation arc can pick this up
  and read the two issues + the emergency fix PR to get the full story.
