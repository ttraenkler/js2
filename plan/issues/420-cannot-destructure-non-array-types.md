# #420 — Cannot destructure non-array types (26 CE)

## Problem

34 tests fail with errors about destructuring a non-array type. Array destructuring patterns are applied to values that are iterable but not arrays (e.g., strings, Sets, Maps, generator results, arguments objects).

Example:
```javascript
let [a, b, c] = "abc";  // string is iterable
let [x, y] = new Set([1, 2]);  // Set is iterable
```

The compiler currently only supports array destructuring on actual array types.

## Priority: medium (26 tests)

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Array destructuring works on strings (character iteration)
- [ ] Array destructuring works on other iterable types where supported
- [ ] Reduce this CE pattern by at least 70%
