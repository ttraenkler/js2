# #766 -- Symbol.iterator protocol for custom iterables

## Status: in-review
## Problem

`for-of`, spread, and destructuring currently assume the iterable is an array. The ES spec requires looking up `Symbol.iterator` on the object and calling it to get an iterator. This breaks:

1. **Custom iterables** -- objects with `[Symbol.iterator]()` method
2. **Map/Set iteration** -- `for (const [k, v] of map)` needs Map's iterator
3. **String iteration** -- `for (const ch of str)` should iterate Unicode code points
4. **Generator results** -- generators return iterables via Symbol.iterator
5. **Spread on iterables** -- `[...iterable]` should use the iterator protocol

### Current behavior

- `for-of` on arrays works (direct index-based iteration)
- `for-of` on other iterables either crashes or produces wrong results
- Custom `[Symbol.iterator]()` methods are never called

### Fix approach

1. When compiling `for-of`, check if the iterable type has a known iterator (array, string, Map, Set, generator)
2. For known types, use optimized iteration (direct array access, string codepoint iteration)
3. For unknown/object types, emit: call `obj[Symbol.iterator]()`, then loop calling `.next()` until `.done === true`
4. This requires the Symbol.iterator well-known symbol to be a recognized property key in the compiler

### Blocked issues this would unblock

- Symbol.toPrimitive
- Symbol.species
- Symbol RegExp protocols
- Symbol.toStringTag / Symbol.hasInstance
- User-defined Symbol property keys

## Complexity: L

## Acceptance criteria

- `for-of` works on custom iterables with `[Symbol.iterator]()` methods
- Map and Set iteration works correctly
- Spread operator works on custom iterables
- Destructuring works on custom iterables
- Array and string iteration is not regressed (fast path preserved)

## Implementation Notes

### Root cause: false "Missing initializer in const" error (~500 test262 failures)

The biggest win: `src/compiler.ts` had a validation check for `const` declarations without
initializers that didn't exclude `for-of` and `for-in` statements. Any `for (const x of arr)`
or `for (const k in obj)` pattern would trigger a false `"Missing initializer in const declaration"`
syntax error, causing ~500 test262 failures.

**Fix:** Added exclusion for `ForOfStatement` and `ForInStatement` parent nodes.

### Non-array struct misidentified as vec struct

`compileForOfArrayTentative` in `statements.ts` checked if the iterable compiled to "a ref to a
struct" and assumed all structs were vec structs (arrays). Class instances (e.g., Range) are also
structs but not iterable via array indexing.

**Fix:** Added `getArrTypeIdxFromVec(ctx, typeIdx) >= 0` check to verify it's actually a vec
struct before using the array iteration path.

### Direct Wasm iteration for known struct types

When the iterable is a known struct type with a `@@iterator` method (e.g., a class with
`[Symbol.iterator]()`), the compiler now:
1. Calls the `@@iterator` method directly in Wasm
2. Calls the `next()` method directly in Wasm
3. Extracts `done` and `value` from struct fields directly

This avoids host imports entirely for custom iterables with known types.

### Runtime iterator protocol improvements

- `__iterator` host import now tries `__call_@@iterator` export for WasmGC struct dispatch
- `__iterator_next` now tries `__call_next` export for struct method dispatch
- Emits `__call_@@iterator` and `__call_next` exports for multi-struct method dispatch

### Test helpers update

Updated `tests/equivalence/helpers.ts` `compileToWasm` to use the runtime's `buildImports`
merged with manual imports, and call `setExports` after instantiation. This enables iterator
protocol host imports in equivalence tests.
