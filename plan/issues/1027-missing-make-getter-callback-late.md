# #1027 — Missing `__make_getter_callback` late-import

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§6.2.6 The Property Descriptor Specification Type](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-property-descriptor-specification-type) — accessor descriptors have \[\[Get\]\] and \[\[Set\]\] fields
- [§10.1.6 OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ordinarydefineownproperty) — step 4: ValidateAndApplyPropertyDescriptor installs getter/setter


## Problem

After PR #43 (#929) merged, 9 test262 tests flipped `pass → compile_error` with the message:

```
L14:14 Missing __make_getter_callback import
```

Examples:
- `test/built-ins/Object/defineProperties/15.2.3.7-6-a-33.js`
- `test/built-ins/Object/defineProperties/15.2.3.7-6-a-40.js` (and several other `15.2.3.7-6-a-*`)
- `test/built-ins/Promise/any/iter-step-err-no-close.js`
- `test/built-ins/Promise/any/iter-step-err-reject.js`

PR #43 introduced the fallback path in `compileArrowAsCallback` that pushes `ref.null.extern` when `__make_getter_callback` isn't in `funcMap`. The tests above exercise code paths where the import *should* be present but the late-import registration isn't firing for some call-site. Result: the generated Wasm references an undeclared import and fails to instantiate (CE).

## Investigation

1. Grep `__make_getter_callback` in `src/codegen/` to find all emit sites
2. Check whether `ensureLateImport('__make_getter_callback')` is called at every emit site
3. Compare the `defineProperties/15.2.3.7-6-a-33.js` WAT against a passing sibling to identify the codegen path that forgot the late-import registration

## Fix

Ensure every emit site that references `__make_getter_callback` calls `ensureLateImport` for it. May require adding a helper so the registration can't be skipped.

## Expected impact

9 tests flip CE → PASS (and possibly more — if the late-import is missed in one codegen path, other tests exercising the same path may also be broken but masked behind earlier CEs).

## Key files

- `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` (PR #43 graceful fallback)
- `src/codegen/late-imports.ts` (or wherever `ensureLateImport` lives)
