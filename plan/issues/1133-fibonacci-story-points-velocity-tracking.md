## Problem

We have no formal complexity estimation, no velocity data, and no principled way to size a sprint. The result: sprints routinely run out of token budget mid-sprint (hit 66% of weekly budget this session), and there is no feedback loop between estimated complexity and actual effort.

This issue defines and implements a complete estimation + velocity protocol:

1. **Fibonacci story points** on every issue
2. **Velocity script** that calculates points/hour and tokens/hour from historical data
3. **Sprint sizing formula** so a sprint's total points ≤ available token budget / tokens-per-point
4. **Protocol updates** across all agent definitions, checklists, and memories

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every issue file has a `points` frontmatter field (fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- [ ] `scripts/velocity.mjs` runs with `node scripts/velocity.mjs` and outputs:
  - Per-issue: id, title, points, hours worked (from git log), tokens burned (from sprint log if available)
  - Aggregate: avg points/hour, avg tokens/point, recommended sprint capacity given current weekly token budget
- [ ] All past `done` issues have been retroactively scored (points field set)
- [ ] Sprint template (`plan/method/velocity-template.md`) includes: token budget at sprint start, target points, actual points completed
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md`, sprint planning protocol, `developer.md`, and pre-completion checklist reference the points field and sprint sizing formula
- [ ] Memory files updated so agents remember to estimate points when creating/claiming issues

## Fibonacci Scale

| Points | Meaning | Examples |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Trivial — single-line or config change | doc fix, flag rename |
| 2 | Small — one function, clear spec | single operator fix, one test262 category |
| 3 | Medium — a few functions, clear spec | new codegen path, small feature |
| 5 | Large — multiple files, needs design | new statement type, multi-file refactor |
| 8 | Very large — architectural | new backend, new phase in compiler |
| 13 | Epic — should be split | only if truly unsplittable |
| 21 | Too big — must split before starting | reject at planning |

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Issue frontmatter field

Add `points` to every issue file. New issues get estimated at creation; past done issues get retroactively scored by the script.

```yaml
---
id: 1133
points: 5        # fibonacci estimate
...
---
```

Add to issue creation checklist and `plan/method/definition-of-ready.md`: an issue without a `points` field is not ready.

### 2. Velocity script (`scripts/velocity.mjs`)

```js
// For each done issue:
//   - read points from frontmatter
//   - infer hours from git: time from first commit on branch to merge commit on main
//     git log --format="%at %s" -- | grep "issue-N-" to find branch commits
//   - read token data from sprint doc if logged (see §4)
//   - output CSV + summary table

// Aggregate:
//   velocity_pts_per_hour = total_points / total_hours
//   tokens_per_point      = total_tokens_burned / total_points  (sprints with token data only)
//   sprint_capacity_pts   = weekly_token_budget * 0.8 / tokens_per_point
//     (0.8 = 80% headroom — never plan to 100% of budget)
```

Git hours heuristic:
```bash
# First commit on a feature branch
git log --format="%at" origin/main..issue-N-slug | tail -1

# Merge commit timestamp on main
git log --format="%at %s" main | grep "Merge.*issue-N" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}'

# Hours = (merge_ts - first_commit_ts) / 3600
```

### 3. Token tracking in sprint docs

Add to sprint doc template (and `plan/method/velocity-template.md`):

```markdown
**Token budget at sprint start**: X% used (Y% remaining of weekly budget)
**Token budget at sprint end**: X% used
**Tokens burned this sprint**: ~Z% of weekly budget
**Target points**: N  (= weekly_budget_remaining * 0.8 / tokens_per_point)
**Actual points completed**: N
```

Until historical token data exists, use `tokens_burned ≈ 0` and build the dataset forward from the next sprint.

### 4. Retroactive scoring of past issues

The velocity script outputs a table of all done issues sorted by sprint:

```
id    title (truncated)           points  hours  sprint
----  --------------------------  ------  -----  ------
138   fix comparison ops          2       1.2    1
139   string concatenation        3       2.1    1
...
```

PO or tech lead reviews the output, adjusts points estimates where the hours data suggests miscalibration, commits the updated frontmatter.

### 5. Protocol file updates

Files to update (in order):

1. **`plan/method/definition-of-ready.md`** — add: "`points` field set (fibonacci)" to the ready checklist
2. **`plan/method/pre-completion-checklist.md`** — add: verify `points` field is set before signaling completion
3. **`CLAUDE.md` sprint planning section** — add: sprint capacity formula, points estimation step in PO→Architect→Dev flow
4. **`.claude/skills/sprint-planning.md`** — add: PO estimates points for all sprint issues; rejects 21-pointers; sprint total ≤ capacity
5. **`plan/method/velocity-template.md`** — update template with token budget fields
6. **`plan/issues/sprints/N/sprint.md` template** — include points target and actual

### 6. Memory updates

- New memory `project_velocity_protocol.md`: fibonacci scale, sprint capacity formula, script location
- Update `MEMORY.md` index

### 7. Sprint sizing formula (the key rule)

```
sprint_capacity = floor(weekly_tokens_remaining * 0.8 / tokens_per_point)
```

Where:
- `weekly_tokens_remaining` = (100% − current_usage%) of weekly budget at sprint start
- `tokens_per_point` = from velocity script; default **8%/point** until calibrated
- `0.8` = 20% buffer for overhead (planning, protocol work, unexpected spikes)

Example at 34% remaining: `34% * 0.8 / 8% ≈ 3.4 points` — a very small sprint, just 1–2 issues.

This makes the token constraint explicit and prevents mid-sprint burnout.

## Notes

- Git hours heuristic undercounts time (gaps between commits aren't working time). Accept this — it's a lower bound and consistent across issues.
- Token data before this session is unavailable; start tracking from Sprint 43 onward.
- The script should also flag issues with `points` missing so the backlog can be cleaned up incrementally.
- Issue #1132 (npm publish) is unrelated and should not be blocked by this.
