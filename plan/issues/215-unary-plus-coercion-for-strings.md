# Issue #215: Unary plus coercion for strings and booleans

**Status:** in-review
**Type:** bug
**Failures:** 2

## Problem
`+""` should produce 0 but currently calls `parseFloat("")` which returns NaN.
`+true` should produce 1 but may not convert i32 to f64 properly.

## Fix
1. Use `__unbox_number` (which does `Number(v)`) instead of `parseFloat` for unary plus on strings
2. Add explicit `f64.convert_i32_s` for unary plus on boolean/i32 operands
