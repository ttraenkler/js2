# #1553b — Delegate `compileObjectDestructuring` typed-struct path to shared helper

After #1553a lands the `mode:'decl'` plumbing, this slice replaces the
~270-line hand-rolled typed-struct branch in
`src/codegen/statements/destructuring.ts:compileObjectDestructuring`
(currently lines 419-683) with a thin wrapper that delegates to
`destructureParamObject({mode:'decl', bindingKind})`.

## Root cause closed by this slice

- **Bug 3 (investigation §2026-05-20, root-cause 3)** — typed-struct
  nested pattern at lines 538-598 has *no* `element.initializer`
  (default) handling at all. The inner per-field loop (544-564) also
  ignores `ne.initializer`. The shared helper handles both via
  `emitNestedBindingDefault` (lines 207-281 of
  `statements/destructuring.ts`) and `emitDefaultValueCheck`
  (lines 297-374).

- **Bug 2 partial mitigation** — the externref-with-known-struct
  fast-path in the shared helper (`destructure-params.ts:489-517`)
  uses `ref.test` + `ref.cast` + `struct.get` instead of round-tripping
  the struct through `__extern_get`, so when the *default*
  initialiser compiles to a known struct type, fields are reachable.

## Failure patterns fixed

From the issue's 8 smoke-tested patterns (investigation §Reproductions):

| Probe | Source | Pre-fix result | Post-fix expected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `let {w:{x,y,z}={x:1,y:2,z:3}}={w:undefined}` (typed RHS) | typed path | throws TypeError | `x=1, y=2, z=3` |
| `let {a, b: {c, d}} = {a:1, b:{c:2, d:3}}` (typed nested, no default) | typed path | works, but TDZ flag missed | works + TDZ flag |
| `let {a={fn:function(){}}} = {}` (typed) | typed path | a.fn.name === "" | a.fn.name === "fn" after #1450 |

test262 patterns that flip on this slice (subset of #1553's 93 fails):

- `test/language/statements/let/dstr/obj-ptrn-prop-obj-value-undef.js`
- `test/language/statements/let/dstr/obj-ptrn-prop-obj-init.js`
- `test/language/statements/const/dstr/obj-ptrn-prop-obj-value-undef.js`
- `test/language/statements/variable/dstr/obj-ptrn-prop-obj-value-undef.js`
- nested object dstr cases that currently `assertion_fail`.

Estimated direct unlock: **≥ 18** cases (the
`obj-ptrn-prop-obj-*` cluster from the issue table). Indirect: more
cases pass once 1553c lands.

## Changes

### File: `src/codegen/statements/destructuring.ts`

**Function: `compileObjectDestructuring` (line 376-683)**

Replace the body **after** the `resultType` computation
(roughly line 419 onward — keep lines 376-417 which compute
`resultType` and dispatch to externref/scalar paths) with:

```ts
// Save current body length so we can rollback if the helper bails
const bodyLenBefore = fctx.body.length;

// Stash the RHS in a temp local for the helper
const tmpLocal = allocLocal(fctx, `__destruct_${fctx.locals.length}`, resultType);
fctx.body.push({ op: "local.set", index: tmpLocal });

// Determine binding kind for TDZ + const tracking
const bindingKind: BindingKind =
  decl.parent.flags & ts.NodeFlags.Const ? "const"
  : decl.parent.flags & ts.NodeFlags.Let ? "let"
  : "var";

// Delegate
destructureParamObject(ctx, fctx, tmpLocal, pattern, resultType, {
  mode: "decl",
  bindingKind,
});

// Module-global sync remains in the caller
syncDestructuredLocalsToGlobals(ctx, fctx, pattern);
return;
```

The dispatchers immediately above the replacement (the externref and
scalar branches that already call
`compileExternrefObjectDestructuringDecl`) are not affected by this
slice — 1553c rewrites those.

Imports to add:

```ts
import {
  destructureParamObject,
  type BindingKind,
} from "../destructuring-params.js";
```

### File: `src/codegen/destructuring-params.ts`

No changes — the helper already exposes the necessary surface after
#1553a.

### Deletion size

~270 lines removed from `compileObjectDestructuring`
(approximately lines 419-683). Net diff: roughly **-260 LOC**.

## Wasm IR pattern (illustrative)

For `let {w: {x, y, z} = {x:1, y:2, z:3}} = {w: undefined}` with the
RHS compiling to struct ref `$Wrapper`:

```wasm
;; outer pattern: stash RHS
local.get $rhs        ;; $Wrapper
local.set $tmp_outer  ;; type: ref_null $Wrapper

;; per-binding TDZ flags (from #1553a)
i32.const 0
local.set $__tdz_x
i32.const 0
local.set $__tdz_y
i32.const 0
local.set $__tdz_z

;; null guard on outer
local.get $tmp_outer
ref.is_null
if
  call $__throw_type_error_destructure_null
end

;; extract w
local.get $tmp_outer
struct.get $Wrapper 0
local.set $tmp_w      ;; type ref_null $Inner

;; emit nested default (via emitNestedBindingDefault)
local.get $tmp_w
ref.is_null
if
  ;; default initialiser {x:1, y:2, z:3} → struct ref
  i32.const 1  i32.const 2  i32.const 3
  struct.new $Inner
  local.set $tmp_w
end

;; recurse: destructure $tmp_w into {x, y, z} (with TDZ inits per binding)
```

## Edge cases

1. **RHS type is unknown / not a known struct** — the existing
   fall-through to externref (lines 458-466 / 472-480) is retained.
   1553c covers that path.

2. **RHS resolves to a struct ref but the pattern has a rest element
   `{a, ...r} = obj`** — the shared helper does **not** rest-emit on
   the struct fast path (it forces `structTypeIdx = undefined` when
   `hasRestElement` at lines 442-443). The helper falls through to
   `destructureParamObjectExternref` automatically. That is correct
   for the typed RHS too — rest must enumerate all enumerable own
   properties (struct.get cannot do that). Verify by inspecting the
   helper output and writing one regression test.

3. **`ensureLetConstBindingPatternTdzFlags`** — moved into the helper
   by 1553a. The caller no longer needs to call it explicitly.

4. **Test262 cases that currently silently pass** because the typed
   path doesn't throw on null — after this slice, the helper's
   `emitExternrefDestructureGuard` (struct path also calls
   `buildDestructureNullThrow` via the nullable-guard at lines 631-643
   of `destructuring-params.ts`) will throw. Verify that any tests
   asserting no-throw on null actually expected the throw (per spec).

## Test files to verify

- `tests/issue-1553.test.ts` (new — shared with #1553c/d; add cases
  incrementally):
  - `let-obj-default-nested` (case in issue file step 6).
- test262 `obj-ptrn-prop-obj-value-undef` for `let`, `const`,
  `variable`.
- test262 `obj-ptrn-prop-obj-init` cluster.

## Regression gate

Before merging, run scoped equivalence tests; then in CI:

- Required: `net_per_test > 0`, no bucket >50, no
  `obj-ptrn-*` regression.
- Watch: `tests/equivalence.test.ts` `# destructuring` block.

## Estimated change size

~ -260 LOC diff (mostly deletions, small insertion of delegation +
import). Single PR.

## Risk

Medium. The replaced code path is on a hot lane (every typed-struct
`let/const/var {…}=expr`). The helper has been exercised heavily for
function parameters, so the risk is in subtle differences in
TDZ-flag emission timing and the null-guard. Mitigate by:

- Comparing the IR of `let {x,y}=obj` before and after on a fixture.
- Verifying that `syncDestructuredLocalsToGlobals` is still called
  (it must remain in the caller, not the helper).

## Out of scope

- Externref-fallback decl path → #1553c.
- Array decl path → #1553d.
- Bug 5 (f64 explicit-undefined sentinel) → #1553e.
- NamedEvaluation → #1450 (in-review).

## Resolution (verified 2026-05-24)

This slice was **skipped in sprint 55** (the team went straight to #1553c).
On verification against current `main` (post-#1553c/#1553d), the typed-struct
path is **already implemented** exactly as this spec describes: the
`// #1553b`-tagged delegation block in
`src/codegen/statements/destructuring.ts:500-570` stashes the RHS into a
struct-typed temp local and calls
`destructureParamObject(ctx, fctx, tmpLocal, pattern, paramType, {mode:'decl', bindingKind})`,
keeping `syncDestructuredLocalsToGlobals` in the caller and routing
`...rest` patterns to the externref fallback. This landed as part of the
#1553c PR (commit `d447400e9`).

Verified all repro/acceptance cases compile + run correctly on current main:

| Case | Source | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nested default fires | `let {w:{x,y,z}={x:1,y:2,z:3}}={w:undefined}` (typed) | PASS (`x=1,y=2,z=3`) |
| nested, no default | `let {a, b:{c,d}} = {a:1,b:{c:2,d:3}}` (typed) | PASS |
| simple typed | `let {x,y} = p` | PASS |
| top-level default | `let {x=99,y} = {y:5}` | PASS (`x=99`) |
| nested null guard | `let {w:{x}} = {w:null}` (typed) | PASS (throws TypeError) |

No code change was required. Regression coverage added in
`tests/issue-1553b.test.ts` (9 cases, all green) to lock the behaviour in.
