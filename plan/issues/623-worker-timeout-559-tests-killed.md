# #623 — Worker timeout: 559 tests killed after 60s

## Status: in-review
559 tests fail with "timeout: worker hung > 60s" even after #610 increased timeout to 60s with retry at 120s. These are genuinely slow tests (complex class hierarchies, large generated code).

### Fix
1. Increase default timeout to 90s, retry at 180s
2. Add per-category timeout overrides (class/generator tests need more time)
3. Profile the slowest tests to find compiler performance bottlenecks

## Complexity: S
