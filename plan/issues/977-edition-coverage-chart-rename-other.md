# #977 — Edition coverage chart labels

## Problem

The edition coverage stacked area chart on the landing page shows "Other" for tests that don't map to a specific ES edition. These should be labeled "ES3/Core" (for pre-ES5 core language tests) or "Proposals" (for stage 3+ proposal tests), matching the feature table section headers.

## Fix

Update `scripts/generate-editions.ts` to map unclassified tests to "ES3/Core" instead of "Other". Proposal-tagged tests should map to "Proposals". Regenerate `public/benchmarks/results/test262-editions.json`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- No "Other" category in the edition chart
- Unclassified tests show as "ES3/Core"
- Proposal tests show as "Proposals" (if included)

## Implementation Summary

### Changes
- **`scripts/generate-editions.ts`**: 
  - Renamed edition `0` from `"Other"` to `"ES3/Core"` in `EDITION_NAMES`
  - Added edition `-1` → `"Proposals"` for tests with unrecognized feature tags
  - Updated `classifyEdition`: tests with `features:` that don't match any known edition now return `-1` (Proposals) instead of falling through to path heuristics
  - Added `-1` to `EDITION_ORDER` (before `0`)
- **`public/benchmarks/results/test262-editions.json`**: Regenerated — now has 14 buckets (was 13), with "Proposals" (5,023 tests) and "ES3/Core" (546 tests) replacing "Other"
