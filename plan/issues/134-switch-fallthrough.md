# #134 — Switch fallthrough

## Problem
Switch cases without `break` don't fall through to the next case. In JS, `switch(x) { case 1: a(); case 2: b(); }` executes both `a()` and `b()` when `x === 1`.

## Scope
- Case fallthrough when no `break`/`return` present
- `default` fallthrough
- Multiple cases sharing a body: `case 1: case 2: doStuff();`

## Implementation
- Currently uses `br_table` or chained `if/else`. Need to restructure to:
  - Use a "matched" flag that stays true once a case matches
  - Execute subsequent case bodies until `break` is encountered
  - Or restructure as a series of blocks where fallthrough jumps to next block's body
