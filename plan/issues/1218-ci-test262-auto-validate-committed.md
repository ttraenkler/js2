origin: split from #1190 research question Q4 — "How do we prevent baseline-file corruption from propagating?" The committed `test262-current.jsonl` is what the dev-self-merge bucket-by-path analysis reads; if it disagrees with reality, regression counts silently mislead.

# #1218 — Auto-validate committed test262 baseline on PR

## Problem

`benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl` is the committed baseline
that `dev-self-merge` Step 4 reads for bucket-by-path regression analysis
(see CLAUDE.md "Baseline files" table). It's refreshed by
`refresh-committed-baseline.yml` after every successful main push.

But there's no validation that the baseline is **honest**. If the
committed file gets corrupted (mass-rewritten by a malformed merge,
desynced by a workflow bug, etc.), the bucket analysis starts producing
wrong answers and the dev-self-merge gate becomes unreliable.

We saw a related symptom in sprint 45: the committed JSONL was 1634
tests behind reality (#1191 fixed it). #1191's fix was the immediate
sync; this issue adds a continuous validator.

## Fix

Add a CI step on every PR that:

1. Picks 50 random "pass" entries from `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl`.
2. Runs `runTest262File` (or the closest equivalent) against current
   `main`'s compiler for each.
3. If any of those 50 currently-listed-as-pass tests do NOT actually
   pass on `main` HEAD: **fail the PR** with a clean error message
   pointing at the baseline file.

This is a fast check (~50 tests × ~1s each = ~1 min) that catches
baseline corruption before it spreads to dev-self-merge analyses.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] New CI step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (or its own workflow)
  that runs the spot-check on every PR.
- [ ] Step takes < 2 min in CI (parallelize across the 50 tests if
  needed).
- [ ] On failure, the error message includes:
  - The 5 most-affected baseline entries (test path, expected: pass,
    observed: <status>).
  - Pointer to `refresh-committed-baseline.yml` to manually re-run if
    the divergence is intentional.
- [ ] Random selection uses a deterministic seed derived from the PR
  number (so failures are reproducible across re-runs).
- [ ] Documentation: add a row to the CLAUDE.md "Baseline files" table
  noting the validator.

## Out of scope

- Validating "fail" entries (less impactful — failing tests rarely
  matter for the gate).
- Validating compile_timeout / compile_error entries (these are the
  noisy categories; spot-checks would themselves be flaky).
- Auto-fixing detected corruption (manual re-run via
  `refresh-committed-baseline.yml` is the documented escape hatch).

## Why this scope

The baseline is small enough to validate cheaply (~16 MB JSONL, 43K
entries). Spot-checking 50/43000 = 0.1% catches mass corruption with
high confidence (any single-test miss in the validator implies many
more silent ones). This is a smoke-test, not a comprehensive validator —
good enough.

## Implementation hints

- Random selection: `Array.from(passes).sort(() => seedRandom(prNum) - 0.5).slice(0, 50)`.
- Run via existing `tests/test262-runner.ts` infrastructure with a
  filter list to limit to the 50 tests.
- For the "expected: pass, observed: ?" output, use the same status
  vocabulary as the JSONL (`pass`, `fail`, `compile_error`,
  `compile_timeout`).
- Failure mode example:
  ```
  Baseline corruption detected: 3 of 50 sampled "pass" entries actually fail/CE on main HEAD:
    - test/built-ins/Promise/resolve/length.js (expected: pass, observed: fail)
    - test/built-ins/Object/getPrototypeOf/name.js (expected: pass, observed: compile_error)
    - test/language/expressions/async-arrow-function/escaped-async.js (expected: pass, observed: fail)
  Refresh the committed baseline by manually triggering refresh-committed-baseline.yml.
  ```

## Related

- #1191 (one-shot baseline refresh + automation) is the *generation*
  side; this issue is the *validation* side.
- #1217 (smoke-canary) is similar in spirit but different scope — it
  measures engine non-determinism, not baseline corruption.

## Implementation notes (2026-05-01)

Shipped:

- `scripts/validate-test262-baseline.ts` — strict validator. Loads
  the committed JSONL, filters to `pass` entries, deterministic-shuffles
  via xorshift32 seeded by `PR_NUMBER` (or env `SEED` / fallback),
  runs `runTest262File` on each. Reports the 5 most-affected entries
  with status + truncated error, points at
  `refresh-committed-baseline.yml`. Exits 0 if all pass, 1 on any
  failure, 2 on internal error.
- `.github/workflows/test262-baseline-validate.yml` — runs on PR with
  path-filter on `src/**`, `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl`,
  the script itself, and the workflow file. Checks out test262
  submodule. 5-minute timeout. Strict (no `continue-on-error`).
- `package.json` — `test:262:validate-baseline` script.
- `CLAUDE.md` — added "Validated by" column to the baseline-files
  table, plus a paragraph explaining the local-run command and seed
  knobs.

### Initial drift exposed

A 50-sample local run against the committed baseline at HEAD
`13061a098` (PR #109 merge commit, baseline timestamped 2026-04-30
21:43) found **9 failures** — 18% drift. Most failures were
`compile_error` from TypeScript's strict checker rejecting test262
patterns that intentionally use `{ valueOf: () => never }` etc. for
runtime-coercion tests. This means the baseline was generated under
slightly different compile state than current main produces. The
validator is doing exactly what it was designed for.

The validator's PR will likely fail its own validator step — that's
expected and proves the gate works. Two paths to land it:
1. Refresh the committed baseline first (run
   `refresh-committed-baseline.yml`), then merge.
2. Tech-lead override-merge with a follow-up issue to refresh and
   re-run.
