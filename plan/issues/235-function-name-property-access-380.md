# Issue #235: Function.name property access (380 compile errors)

## Status: in-progress

## Summary

380 tests fail to compile because they access `.name` on function values. The TypeScript compiler reports "Property 'name' does not exist on type '() => void'" or similar. These tests check that functions have the correct `.name` property per the ES2015 spec.

## Root Cause

TypeScript's type system does not include `.name` on function types by default (it is on the `Function` interface, but arrow functions and function expressions are typed as their call signature). The compiled output tries to access a property that does not exist on the wasm struct representing the function.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- PropertyAccessExpression handling for function types
- Tests affected: ~380 compile errors

## Expected Impact

Implementing Function.name would unlock ~380 tests for compilation. However, many of these tests also have other errors (unsupported call, class declaration), so the net new passing tests would be lower -- estimated ~100-150 tests unlocked.

## Suggested Approach

1. When accessing `.name` on a function-typed value, return a string constant derived from the function's declaration name
2. For function declarations/expressions, store the name as a string global or struct field
3. For anonymous functions, return `""` (empty string per spec)
4. For class methods, return the method name
5. Handle via a special case in PropertyAccessExpression when the object type is a function ref

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `functionName.name` returns the declared name as a string
- [ ] Anonymous function expressions return `""`
- [ ] At least 100 compile errors resolved
- [ ] No regression in existing function tests

## Complexity: M
