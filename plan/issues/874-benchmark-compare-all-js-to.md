# Benchmark: compare all JS-to-Wasm engines on standard performance benchmarks

## Problem

Our comparison table in the blog post has "No benchmarks yet" for js2wasm and "No data" for several competitors. We cite third-party claims (Porffor: "10-30x faster than interpreter-bundling", QuickJS: "20-100x slower than V8") but have not independently verified any of them. We need our own numbers.

## Engines to benchmark

**AOT compilers (no bundled runtime):**
- js2wasm (our project)
- Porffor
- JAWSM (if it can run the benchmarks)

**Interpreter-bundling:**
- Javy (QuickJS in Wasm)
- StarlingMonkey (SpiderMonkey in Wasm, if extractable)

**Baselines:**
- V8 / Node.js (1x reference)
- QuickJS standalone (interpreter baseline)

## Benchmark suites

### Primary: Octane subtests (cherry-picked, DOM-free)

- **Richards** — OOP scheduler, vtable/dispatch overhead
- **DeltaBlue** — constraint solver, object allocation + method calls
- **RayTrace** — floating point math, object creation, numeric codegen
- **NavierStokes** — 2D array manipulation, tight loops, array access
- **Box2D** — physics simulation, complex object graphs + math

These are pure JS, run in Node.js, no DOM. V8 is heavily optimized for them — that's a feature: it gives us a best-case ceiling.

### Secondary: Kraken subtests

- **audio-fft, audio-oscillator** — DSP patterns
- **crypto-aes, crypto-sha256** — bitwise operations, tight loops
- **imaging-gaussian-blur** — 2D array traversal

Complements Octane with real-world compute patterns (crypto, DSP, image processing).

## Dimensions to measure

For each engine x benchmark:

1. **Startup time** — time to first output (AOT should beat interpreter-bundling)
2. **Peak throughput** — sustained compute (ops/sec or wall-clock time)
3. **Binary size** — total module size (matters for edge/serverless)
4. **Memory footprint** — peak RSS during execution

## What to avoid

- Speedometer (needs DOM)
- SunSpider (too small, startup-dominated)
- Benchmarks requiring `eval()` or dynamic code generation (Wasm can't do this)
- Any benchmark that uses features js2wasm doesn't support yet (start with what we can compile)

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Harness that runs selected Octane + Kraken subtests across all available engines
- [ ] Results table with startup, throughput, binary size, memory for each engine x benchmark
- [ ] Results published to `benchmarks/results/` alongside existing test262 reports
- [ ] Blog comparison table updated with real numbers replacing "No data" / "No benchmarks yet"

## Notes

- Start with the Octane subtests we can actually compile today. Even partial results (2-3 subtests) are more valuable than no data.
- Some benchmarks may need minor modifications to avoid unsupported features (eval, with, etc.)
- Porffor and JAWSM may not compile all subtests — document what works and what doesn't.
- This is also a good stress test for js2wasm's conformance: if a benchmark fails to compile, that's a data point too.
