# #1174 — Object-literal property keys leak `string_constants` host import on `--target wasi`

## Problem

The `object-ops` benchmark program (a basic object-literal field-write
loop) compiles and `wasmtime compile` succeeds, but `wasmtime run` fails
to instantiate the resulting cwasm:

```
Error: Error: failed to run main module `/tmp/.../object-ops.cwasm`

Caused by:
    0: failed to instantiate "/tmp/.../object-ops.cwasm"
    1: unknown import: `string_constants::a,b,c` has not been defined
```

The js2wasm emit is using a `string_constants` host import to deliver
the property names `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"` (the keys of the object literal)
into the Wasm module. That import is part of the JS-host runtime that
gets satisfied by `buildImports(...)` when running through Node. In
`--target wasi` mode, the module is supposed to be standalone — there
is no JS host, so the import is unsatisfiable and instantiation fails.

## Reproduction

Source program (from `benchmarks/competitive/programs/object-ops.js`):

```js
/** @param {number} n @returns {number} */
export function run(n) {
  let acc = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    const record = {
      a: i | 0,
      b: (i * 3) | 0,
      c: (i ^ 0x55aa) | 0,
    };
    acc = (acc + record.a + record.b - record.c) | 0;
  }
  return acc | 0;
}
```

Compile path:

```ts
const result = compile(source, {
  fileName: 'object-ops.js',
  allowJs: true,
  target: 'wasi',
  optimize: 4,
});
// js2wasm reports success and result.imports STILL contains
//   { module: 'string_constants', name: 'a,b,c', ... }
// despite target: 'wasi'
```

The benchmark harness explicitly checks `compileResult.imports` for
non-WASI imports and bails with `status: 'blocked'` if any are present
(`benchmarks/compare-runtimes.ts`, the `nonWasiImports` block around
line 1514). The `string_constants::a,b,c` import slips through that
check (the harness flagged it as a runtime-error rather than a blocked
state — this issue tracks fixing the codegen, not the harness).

## Root cause hypothesis

When `nativeStrings` is enabled (auto-on for WASI targets, see
`src/codegen/index.ts`), string literals should be lowered to either
inline `(array i16)` constants or compile-time-baked string-pool
entries — not to a `string_constants` host import.

Object-literal property keys are a separate code path from "regular"
string literals. They flow through `getOrCreatePropertyKey` /
`compileObjectLiteral` and the lookup table that backs property
accesses. That path may not yet be wired through the `nativeStrings` /
WASI pivot, so it still emits the legacy `string_constants` import.

Suspected files:
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — `compileObjectLiteralExpression` and
  the property-key emission for object literal members
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — `addUnionImports` / late-import path,
  `nativeStrings` decision logic
- `src/runtime.ts` — `string_constants` host-side resolver (currently
  exists as a JS-host fallback)

## Scope of impact

Any program that uses object literals with string property keys built
for `--target wasi`. That includes essentially every non-trivial JS
program: framework state, configuration objects, JSON-shaped values,
record patterns. Without this fix, `--target wasi` builds will fail
to instantiate for almost any real-world program. It's blocking for
the standalone-Wasm story in general.

## Acceptance criteria

- `object-ops` benchmark program runs end-to-end through `wasmtime
  compile` + `wasmtime run --invoke "run(1000)"`, returning the same
  numeric result as the Node baseline.
- Benchmark JSON shows `js2wasm-wasmtime` lane `status: ok` for
  `object-ops`.
- `compileResult.imports` is empty (or contains only WASI-prefixed
  imports) for the `object-ops` source under `--target wasi`.
- Larger smoke-test: a new `tests/issue-1174.test.ts` covers a few
  shapes of object literal (string keys, numeric keys, computed keys
  with string-constant values) under WASI mode and verifies no
  `string_constants` import is emitted.
- No regression on JS-host-mode (default target) — the host-import
  path can stay as the fallback when WASI is not selected.

## Key files

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — `compileObjectLiteralExpression`
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — `nativeStrings` flag wiring + import emission
- `src/runtime.ts` — current `string_constants` host-side handler (for
  the JS-host fallback)
- `benchmarks/competitive/programs/object-ops.js` — the canonical repro

## Implementation summary

Two distinct codegen paths were leaking `string_constants` imports under
`--target wasi`:

1. **`emitStructFieldNamesExport`** (`src/codegen/index.ts`) emitted a
   `__struct_field_names(externref) -> externref` export whose body did
   `global.get` on a comma-joined CSV of struct field names registered as
   a `string_constants` global. The export is purely for JS host
   introspection (Object.keys / JSON.stringify / for-in on opaque structs)
   — dead code under WASI. Now skipped entirely when `ctx.nativeStrings`
   is true.

2. **`typeErrorThrowInstrs`** (`src/codegen/property-access.ts`) emitted
   `global.get strIdx; throw __exn` for null-check throws on property
   accesses, with `strIdx` registered as a `string_constants` global.
   Now uses `stringConstantExternrefInstrs` (new helper in
   `native-strings.ts`) which materializes the message inline as a
   FlatString struct + `extern.convert_any` in nativeStrings mode.

Supporting change: `addStringConstantGlobal` (`src/codegen/registry/imports.ts`)
now short-circuits in nativeStrings mode — registers the value with the
sentinel `-1` in `stringGlobalMap` (matching `collectStringLiterals`'
finalize path) and skips the host import. This both prevents the runtime
instantiation failure AND avoids the global-index shift that previously
ran every time a string was registered late.

## Test Results

- `tests/issue-1174.test.ts` — 4/4 pass (compile + verify no
  `string_constants` byte sequence in the binary, instantiate with empty
  imports)
- The canonical `object-ops.js` benchmark instantiates with **0 imports
  needed** and `run(1000)` returns `-20015548`, matching the Node.js
  baseline exactly.
