# #637 — Create walkInstructions utility (eliminates 5 duplicate walkers)

## Status: in-review
5+ independent implementations of "walk all instructions recursively into blocks" across: shiftInstrs, patchInstrs, collectRefsFromBody, optimizeBody, walkInstrs/walkBlockTypes in WAT emitter.

### Fix
Create a single `walkInstructions(instrs, visitor)` utility and refactor all walkers to use it.

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

Created `src/codegen/walk-instructions.ts` with two exports:
- `walkInstructions(instrs, visitor)` -- recursively walks all instructions, calling visitor on each
- `walkChildren(instr, fn)` -- yields nested instruction arrays (body, then, else, catches, catchAll) for a single instruction

Refactored 4 walkers to use the shared utility:
1. `shiftInstrs` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`
2. `remapFuncIdxInBody` in `src/codegen/dead-elimination.ts`
3. `remapTypeIdxInBody` in `src/codegen/dead-elimination.ts`
4. `walkInstrs` + `walkBlockTypes` in `src/emit/wat.ts`

Not refactored (more complex patterns that go beyond simple per-instruction visiting):
- `collectRefsFromBody` in dead-elimination.ts -- uses switch/case with op-specific logic and handles its own recursion differently for block/loop/if/try
- `optimizeBody` in peephole.ts -- needs array mutation (splice) which requires index-based iteration, not compatible with simple visitor pattern
- `patchInstrs` in expressions.ts -- iterates backwards with splice insertion

Added 8 unit tests in `tests/walk-instructions.test.ts` covering flat lists, block recursion, if/then/else, try/catches/catchAll, nested blocks, and mutation via visitor.
