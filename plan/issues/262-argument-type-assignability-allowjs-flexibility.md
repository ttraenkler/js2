# Issue #262: Argument type assignability -- allowJs flexibility for test262

## Status: done

## Summary
~325 tests fail with "Argument of type X is not assignable to parameter of type Y" as the primary error. In allowJs mode (used for test262), TypeScript's strict type checking rejects valid JS patterns. The compiler should suppress or relax these diagnostics for allowJs compilations.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group C

## Complexity: M

## Scope
- Extend allowJs type flexibility to suppress argument assignability errors
- Handle common patterns: boolean/string/object passed where number expected
- Handle arrays passed where iterable expected
- Update diagnostic filtering in `src/codegen/index.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Common argument type mismatches no longer cause compile errors in allowJs mode
- At least 80 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
The core diagnostic codes TS2345 ("Argument of type X is not assignable to parameter of type Y") and TS2322 ("Type X is not assignable to type Y") were already in the `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` set from early in the project. The stale test262 report showed these as compile errors because the error string construction in test262-runner.ts included warnings alongside actual errors.

Additional diagnostic codes added in this pass:
- **TS2538**: "Type 'X' cannot be used as an index type" (20 occurrences in report)
- **TS1468**: "A computed property name must be of type 'string', 'number', 'symbol', or 'any'"
- **TS2741**: "Property 'X' is missing in type 'Y' but required in type 'Z'"

Also fixed the test262-runner.ts compile_error reporting to prefer severity "error" messages over warnings when constructing error strings, so future reports accurately reflect the blocking error rather than including downgraded warnings.

### What worked
- The existing DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES mechanism effectively suppresses TS type-checking diagnostics
- All "Argument of type" and "Type is not assignable" errors are downgraded to warnings

### Files changed
- `src/compiler.ts` -- added TS2538, TS1468, TS2741 to DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- filter warnings from compile_error strings
