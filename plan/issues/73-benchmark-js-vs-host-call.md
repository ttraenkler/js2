# Issue 73: Benchmark — JS vs host-call vs GC-native vs linear-memory performance

## Summary

Build a benchmark suite that compares four execution strategies for the same
operations across strings, arrays, and DOM APIs:

1. **Pure JS** — baseline JavaScript running in the engine
2. **Wasm + host calls** — wasm code that crosses the boundary to call JS APIs
   (current default mode)
3. **Wasm + GC memory** — wasm code using WasmGC structs/arrays with no host
   calls (current fast mode, issues #71/#72)
4. **Wasm + linear memory** — wasm code using linear memory with manual
   allocation (issue #70 phase 2–3, #46)

## Motivation

We now have three distinct compilation backends producing fundamentally
different wasm output for the same TypeScript source. Each has different
performance characteristics:

- **Host calls** pay boundary-crossing cost per operation but leverage the
  engine's optimized built-ins (e.g., V8's string internals)
- **GC-native** eliminates boundary crossings but reimplements operations in
  wasm bytecode — may be slower for complex operations the engine has hand-tuned
- **Linear memory** avoids both boundary crossings and GC overhead but requires
  manual memory management and may miss engine optimizations

Without benchmarks, we're guessing which approach wins for which workload. The
results will guide which mode to recommend for different use cases and where to
focus optimization effort.

## Benchmark categories

### 1. Strings

| Benchmark | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| concat-short | Concatenate 10k short strings (< 16 chars) |
| concat-long | Concatenate 1k long strings (> 1k chars) |
| search | indexOf/includes on a 10k-char haystack, 1k iterations |
| split-join | Split a CSV line by comma, rejoin, 10k iterations |
| replace | Replace all occurrences in a paragraph, 1k iterations |
| case-convert | toLowerCase/toUpperCase on 1k strings |
| substring | Extract substrings from positions, 10k iterations |
| template | Build strings from parts (simulating template literals) |

### 2. Arrays

| Benchmark | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| push-pop | Push 100k elements, then pop all |
| sort-i32 | Sort 10k random i32 values |
| sort-f64 | Sort 10k random f64 values |
| map-filter | Map then filter a 10k-element array |
| reduce | Sum/accumulate over 100k elements |
| indexOf | Search for elements in a 10k array, 1k lookups |
| slice-splice | Slice and splice operations on 1k-element arrays |
| reverse | Reverse a 10k-element array, 1k iterations |
| nested | Operations on array-of-arrays (2D matrix ops) |

### 3. DOM APIs

| Benchmark | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| create-elements | Create and append 1k DOM elements |
| set-attributes | Set 10 attributes on 1k elements |
| read-attributes | Read attributes from 1k elements |
| modify-text | Update textContent on 1k elements |
| add-remove-class | Toggle classes on 1k elements, 100 iterations |
| query-selector | querySelector/querySelectorAll, 1k queries |
| event-listeners | Add/remove event listeners, 1k elements |
| style-mutation | Modify inline styles on 1k elements |
| batch-dom | Build a complex subtree, then insert once (vs incremental) |

**Note on DOM:** DOM APIs are inherently host-bound — wasm cannot access the DOM
without crossing the boundary. The comparison here is:
- **JS baseline** vs **wasm + host calls** — measures the boundary overhead
  itself
- **Batched vs per-element** — measures whether wasm-side batching (building
  instruction lists in GC/linear memory, then flushing) can amortize boundary
  cost
- For GC-native and linear-memory columns, DOM benchmarks test string
  construction and data preparation on the wasm side with a final host flush

### 4. Mixed workloads

| Benchmark | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| json-process | Parse JSON, transform, re-serialize |
| text-search | Search and highlight matches in a document |
| table-render | Build an HTML table from array data |
| csv-parse | Parse CSV text into typed arrays |
| form-validate | Validate string inputs against rules |

## Implementation design

### Benchmark harness

```typescript
interface BenchmarkResult {
  name: string;
  strategy: "js" | "host-call" | "gc-native" | "linear-memory";
  iterations: number;
  totalMs: number;
  avgMs: number;
  medianMs: number;
  p95Ms: number;
  memoryBytes?: number;  // if measurable
}
```

Each benchmark:
1. Compiles the same TypeScript source with different compiler options
2. Instantiates the resulting wasm module
3. Runs warmup iterations (discarded)
4. Runs timed iterations, collecting per-iteration timings
5. Reports statistics

### Compiler configurations

```typescript
const strategies = {
  "js":            null, // run source directly in JS
  "host-call":     { fast: false },
  "gc-native":     { fast: true },
  "linear-memory": { fast: true, target: "linear" },  // future
};
```

### Output format

Results written as JSON and optionally rendered as a markdown table or HTML
chart. Example output:

```
| Benchmark     | JS      | Host-call | GC-native | Linear  | Winner     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| sort-i32      | 12.3ms  | 18.7ms    | 9.1ms     | 8.4ms   | linear     |
| concat-short  | 2.1ms   | 14.5ms    | 6.3ms     | 5.8ms   | js         |
| split-join    | 5.4ms   | 22.1ms    | 7.8ms     | 7.2ms   | js         |
| push-pop      | 3.2ms   | 11.4ms    | 4.1ms     | 3.5ms   | js         |
| create-elems  | 8.7ms   | 12.3ms    | 11.9ms    | 12.1ms  | js         |
```

### File structure

```
benchmarks/
  harness.ts          — benchmark runner, timing, statistics
  results/            — JSON output from runs
  suites/
    strings.ts        — string benchmarks
    arrays.ts         — array benchmarks
    dom.ts            — DOM benchmarks
    mixed.ts          — mixed workload benchmarks
  report.ts           — generate markdown/HTML from results
```

## Metrics to capture

- **Throughput**: operations per second
- **Latency**: avg, median, p95, p99 per operation
- **Compiled size**: .wasm binary size per strategy
- **Compile time**: time to compile the benchmark source
- **Memory**: peak memory usage where measurable (linear memory is directly
  measurable; GC memory requires engine-specific APIs)
- **Startup**: module instantiation time

## Environment considerations

- Run on V8 (Node/Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), and JSC (Safari) if possible
- Pin to specific engine versions for reproducibility
- Use `performance.now()` for timing, `process.memoryUsage()` for Node
- Disable GC between iterations where possible (`--expose-gc` + `global.gc()`)
- Report engine + version + platform in results

## Expected insights

The benchmarks should help answer:

1. **When does GC-native beat host calls?** — Likely for tight loops with many
   small operations (sort, map, search). Host calls may win for complex
   single-call operations where the engine has optimized builtins.

2. **When does JS beat all wasm strategies?** — Likely for string operations
   where V8's internal rope/cons-string representations outperform flat arrays.

3. **Is the boundary crossing cost constant or proportional?** — Measure with
   varying payload sizes.

4. **Does linear memory beat GC memory?** — GC has allocation pressure; linear
   memory has manual management overhead. Which dominates?

5. **What's the DOM boundary floor?** — What's the minimum overhead for any wasm
   DOM interaction, and can batching amortize it below JS?

## Complexity

M — The harness is straightforward; the bulk of work is writing equivalent
implementations in each strategy and ensuring fair comparison. Linear-memory
benchmarks depend on #70 phases 2–3 and can be added incrementally.

## Dependencies

| Issue | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **#70** | Fast mode — provides GC-native compilation |
| **#71** | Native strings — GC-native string benchmarks |
| **#72** | Native arrays — GC-native array benchmarks |
| **#46** | Linear memory backend — linear-memory benchmarks |

## Non-goals

- Micro-benchmarking individual wasm instructions (use engine-level tools)
- Comparing against other languages (C/Rust) — this is about ts2wasm strategies
- Optimizing based on results (separate issues per finding)
