# #1213 — `refresh-benchmarks` workflow expects sidebar baseline at gitignored location

## Symptom

Every PR's `refresh-benchmarks` GitHub Actions job fails at the **"Snapshot current performance baseline"** step with:

```
Missing committed playground benchmark baseline.
##[error]Process completed with exit code 2.
```

Confirmed on PR #104 (Apr 30, 2026, run [25187412611](https://github.com/loopdive/js2/actions/runs/25187412611)).

## Root cause

Commit `616a7a528` (`chore(lfs): migrate JSONL and benchmark runs out of LFS`, 2026-04-25) untracked `public/benchmarks/results/*.json` from git as part of the LFS quota cleanup. After this migration:

- **Committed (canonical)**: `benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json` ✅
- **Gitignored (derived)**: `public/benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json` ❌
- **Gitignored (derived)**: `playground/public/benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json` ❌

But `.github/workflows/benchmark-refresh.yml` (introduced in commit `8bd1c0142`, before the LFS migration) only checks the two **derived** locations:

```yaml
if [ -f public/benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json ]; then
  cp ...
elif [ -f playground/public/benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json ]; then
  cp ...
else
  echo "Missing committed playground benchmark baseline."
  exit 2
fi
```

Neither file is in a fresh CI checkout post-LFS-migration → workflow fails.

The canonical source per `scripts/generate-playground-benchmark-sidebar.mjs` (`RESULTS_PATH`) and per `scripts/build-pages.js` (line ~316: "canonical source lives in benchmarks/results/ (committed)") is `benchmarks/results/`. The two `public/` copies are generated as build-time mirrors.

## Fix

Add `benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json` as the **first** candidate in the snapshot step. Keep the existing fallbacks in case someone has local-only `public/` copies — same payload, no functional difference.

```yaml
mkdir -p benchmark-baseline
if [ -f benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json ]; then
  cp benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json benchmark-baseline/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json
elif [ -f public/benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json ]; then
  cp public/benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json benchmark-baseline/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json
elif [ -f playground/public/benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json ]; then
  cp playground/public/benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json benchmark-baseline/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json
else
  echo "Missing committed playground benchmark baseline."
  exit 2
fi
```

The diff step's candidate path (`public/benchmarks/results/playground-benchmark-sidebar.json`) doesn't need changes — it's written by `pnpm run refresh:benchmarks` (via `generate-playground-benchmark-sidebar.mjs` line ~159 `copyFileSync(RESULTS_PATH, PUBLIC_PATH)`) before the diff runs.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `refresh-benchmarks` job passes on PR CI
- [ ] No regression in regression-detection behavior (same baseline content, just sourced from the committed location)
- [ ] Comment in the workflow explains why three fallback paths exist

## Implementation notes

- **Why not just fix the LFS migration?** The migration was intentional — `*.json` benchmark artifacts shouldn't bloat LFS. The committed `benchmarks/results/` location is the right one; the workflow just needs to follow the move.
- **Why a comment block instead of removing the fallbacks?** Some local dev workflows (e.g. running `refresh:benchmarks` locally without committing) leave the `public/` copies behind. Keeping the fallbacks means CI works in both fresh-checkout and local-iteration scenarios. The canonical-first ordering ensures fresh CI always picks the committed payload.
