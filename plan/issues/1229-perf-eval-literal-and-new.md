# #1229 — `eval(literal)` / `new RegExp(literal)` should not re-compile per loop iteration

See backlog file for full spec: `plan/issues/backlog/1229.md`

## Summary

Seven `compile_timeout` entries are genuine runtime infinite loops in the
`eval` / `RegExp` shims: a `for` loop over 65k BMP codepoints that compiles a
fresh regex per iteration. On js2wasm each iteration pays full `__eval` host
import cost (TS+codegen+wasm-instantiate pipeline). 65,536 × ~50ms = an hour
of wall-clock; we hit the 30s pool ceiling in the first few hundred iterations.

**Fix (three halves, any one of which helps):**

1. **LRU cache in `__eval` host import** — keyed on source string → compiled
   module. Zero-cost on cache hit. For the 65k tests the strings are all unique
   so this helps general code, not these specific tests.

2. **LRU cache in `new RegExp(source, flags)` host path** — keyed on
   `(source, flags)` → parsed regex. Cheaper per-call for repeated regexes.

3. **Peephole `eval("/" + X + "/")` → `new RegExp(X)`** in
   `src/codegen/expressions.ts` `compileCallExpression` — eliminates the full
   eval pipeline overhead for the most common eval-as-regex pattern. This is the
   half most likely to fix the 7 target tests.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `compile_timeout` count drops by 7 (the two clusters)
- No regression in `tests/equivalence/` eval tests
- The 7 target tests reach their actual pass/fail outcome within the 30s ceiling
