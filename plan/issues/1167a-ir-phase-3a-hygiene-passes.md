## Implementation Summary

Added three IR hygiene passes and wired them into `src/ir/integration.ts`:

- **`src/ir/passes/constant-fold.ts`**: Folds constant IrInstr values at compile time (arithmetic on `i32_const`/`f64_const`, boolean ops, identity folds). Rewrites instructions in-place and cleans up dead constant definitions via a use-count pass.
- **`src/ir/passes/dead-code.ts`**: Removes unreachable blocks (post-terminator instructions), dead stores (values with zero uses that have no side effects), and unused function clones.
- **`src/ir/passes/simplify-cfg.ts`**: Merges trivially-chained blocks (single predecessor/successor with unconditional `br`), eliminates empty blocks, and folds constant-condition branches.
- **`src/ir/lower.ts`**: Added `br` terminator lowering (`block`/`br` + label tracking) to handle the new simplifyCFG block structure.
- **`tests/ir/passes.test.ts`**: 689-line test suite covering CF, DCE, and simplifyCFG in isolation and in combination.

No test262 impact (IR path is still gated behind `isPhase1Expr`). Merged PR #6 (2026-04-23).

# #1167a — IR Phase 3a: constant-fold + dead-code + simplify-cfg

## Context

First slice of IR Phase 3. These three passes require no changes to the IR
type system or frontend — they operate entirely on the existing `IrInstr`
union and basic-block structure that Phase 2 (#1131) produced.

They are prerequisites for the later passes: inlining benefits from
constant-folded arguments, and monomorphization needs a clean CFG.

## Pass 1 — `src/ir/passes/constant-fold.ts`

Fold constant IR values at compile time. Walk block.instrs and rebuild use
counts on demand (there is no persistent use-def index — see `lower.ts:293-326`
`collectIrUses`/`collectTerminatorUses` for the pattern):

- `prim add(const 1, const 2)` → `const 3`
- `prim lt(const 3, const 5)` → `const true`
- `br_if(const true, bb1, bb2)` → `br(bb1)` (unconditional branch)
- `prim mul(x, const 0)` → `const 0`

Binary/unary opcode folding: maintain a dispatch table mapping opcode string
(`"f64.add"`, `"i32.eq"`, etc.) to a constant folder — do not write a
giant inline switch.

`raw.wasm` instructions (`nodes.ts:216-222`) must be treated as always-live
since they have opaque side effects; DCE must never remove them.

**`br` lowering prerequisite**: `lower.ts:259-260` currently throws on `br`
terminators. CF will produce `br` when it rewrites `br_if(const true, A, B)`.
Add `br` lowering to `lower.ts` as part of this issue:
emit the successor block body inline (same pattern as the `br_if` then-branch
at `lower.ts:250-257`).

## Pass 2 — `src/ir/passes/dead-code.ts`

Eliminate unreachable blocks and unused values after constant folding:

- Blocks with no predecessors (made unreachable by constant-folded branches) →
  remove from the function's block list
- Values with zero uses and no side effects (`const`, `prim`, `unary`,
  `binary`) → remove the instruction

**Block renumbering required**: `verify.ts:41-45` enforces `block.id === index`.
When DCE removes block index N, all blocks at N+1..end shift down. DCE must
rebuild `func.blocks` as a dense array and rewrite every `IrBranch.target` to
the new index. Pass must leave `verifyIrFunction` with zero errors.

Distinct from the backend `dead-elimination.ts` in `src/codegen/` which
operates on Wasm imports/type definitions, not IR values.

## Pass 3 — `src/ir/passes/simplify-cfg.ts`

After dead-code removal, merge single-successor chains:

- Block A ends with unconditional `br bb_B`; B has only A as predecessor →
  merge A and B into one block, removing the branch
- Empty blocks (no instructions before terminator) → redirect predecessors
  directly to the successor

This matters because `lower.ts:218-265` expects a narrow CFG shape. Leftover
empty blocks from constant-fold + DCE produce redundant `if/else` wrappers in
the emitted WAT.

**Implementation order dependency**: simplifyCFG only has surface to operate on
once CF has produced `br` terminators. Develop CF + `br` lowering first;
simplifyCFG can then be developed and tested against CF output.

## Pipeline position

```
propagateTypes (Phase 2)
  → constantFold    ← this issue
  → deadCode        ← this issue
  → simplifyCFG     ← this issue
  → [inline-small, Phase 3b]
  → lowerToWasm
```

## Key files

- `src/ir/passes/` — new directory; one file per pass
- `src/ir/integration.ts:108` — wire passes after `propagateTypes` call
- `src/ir/nodes.ts` — no changes needed; existing `IrInstr` union sufficient

## End-to-end test case

The three passes must flow correctly through this example:

```ts
function f(n: number): number {
  if (1 < 2) return n * 2;
  return n;
}
```

- CF: `br_if(f64.lt(const 1, const 2))` → fold to `br_if(const true)` → `br(thenBlock)`
- DCE: remove the now-unreachable else block; rebuild block indices
- simplifyCFG: merge entry block with then block (single successor)

This end-to-end case must be in `tests/ir/passes.test.ts`.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `src/ir/passes/constant-fold.ts`, `dead-code.ts`, `simplify-cfg.ts` exist
2. `br` lowering added to `lower.ts` (prerequisite for CF branch rewriting)
3. `constantFold(fn)` folds `prim add(const 1, const 2)` to `const 3`
4. CF rewrites `br_if(const true, A, B)` to `br(A)`
5. `deadCode(fn)` removes unreachable blocks and rebuilds `func.blocks` as a
   dense array with all `IrBranch.target` indices rewritten; `verifyIrFunction`
   returns zero errors after DCE
6. `simplifyCFG(fn)` merges single-successor chains
7. End-to-end test (CF → DCE → simplifyCFG on the `if (1 < 2)` example) passes
8. Passes wired into `src/ir/integration.ts`
9. `npm test -- tests/equivalence.test.ts` passes with no regressions
10. No regressions in test262

## Test Results

Scoped local checks on branch `issue-1167a-ir-hygiene-passes`:

- New test file `tests/ir/passes.test.ts` — **20/20 pass** (all acceptance
  criteria covered: CF inst folding, CF br_if→br, DCE block removal +
  renumbering, DCE value removal, raw.wasm preserved, simplifyCFG merge,
  full pipeline end-to-end on `if (1 < 2) return n * 2; return n;`).
- Existing IR tests pass unchanged — 101/101:
  - `tests/ir-scaffold.test.ts` — 7/7
  - `tests/ir-frontend-widening.test.ts` — 21/21
  - `tests/ir-if-else-equivalence.test.ts` — 22/22
  - `tests/ir-let-const-equivalence.test.ts` — 12/12
  - `tests/ir-numeric-bool-equivalence.test.ts` — 31/31
  - `tests/ir-ternary-equivalence.test.ts` — 8/8
- Full `tests/equivalence/` — **33 files failed, 136 passed** (1185/1291
  tests passing). **Identical to main baseline** — 0 regressions from the
  hygiene-pass wiring. The 33 failing files are pre-existing and unrelated
  (yield-as-expression, arguments-object valueOf, array-inline-return,
  etc.) — confirmed by running the same suite on `main` with my changes
  stashed.

## Architect Review — Round 2

Three issues a dev will hit if they implement this spec as written:

### 1. `br` terminator lowering is missing, so constant-folded branches crash the lowerer

The spec assumes CF will rewrite `cond_branch(const true, bb1, bb2)` to an unconditional branch (line 33), and simplify-cfg merges single-successor chains (line 58). Both presuppose an unconditional `br` terminator exists and lowers. It doesn't today:

- `src/ir/lower.ts:259-260` explicitly throws on `br`:
  ```ts
  case "br":
    throw new Error(`ir/lower: Phase 1 does not support 'br' terminators (${func.name})`);
  ```
- `from-ast.ts` never emits `br` — only `br_if` or `return`. So the current IR has zero `br` terminators in the wild.

Implication: the first time CF rewrites `br_if(const true, A, B)` to `br(A)`, lowering crashes. Options for the dev:
- **(a)** Add `br` lowering to `lower.ts` as part of 1167a (straightforward — emit successor block body inline, same pattern as the br_if `then` branch handling at `lower.ts:250-257`).
- **(b)** Have CF leave the terminator as `br_if(const true, A, A)` (both arms to A) and let DCE remove the redundant branch. Ugly but avoids touching lower.ts.

The spec must pick one. Recommended: option (a). Add to acceptance criteria.

### 2. DCE must renumber blocks — `blocks[i].id === i` invariant

`src/ir/verify.ts:41-45` enforces that each block's `id` field equals its index in `func.blocks`:
```ts
if ((func.blocks[i].id as number) !== i) {
  errors.push({ message: `block ${i} has id ${func.blocks[i].id}, expected ${i}`, ... });
}
```
When DCE removes block index 2, blocks 3..N shift down by one. Every `branch.target` referencing those blocks must be rewritten. The spec says "remove from the function's block list" (line 45) without calling this out. Add one sentence under Pass 2 acceptance criteria:

> DCE must rebuild `func.blocks` as a dense array and rewrite every `IrBranch.target` to the new index. Pass must leave `verifyIrFunction` errors empty.

### 3. Simplify-cfg has no surface until CF produces `br`

The current IR has no single-successor chains in raw output — `from-ast.ts` only emits `br_if` and `return`. So simplify-cfg's "merge A and B into one block" (line 58) only fires on IR that's already been through CF rewriting a const-`br_if` into a `br`. The spec bundles all three passes and suggests they can be developed independently; in reality the dev must land CF + `br`-lowering before simplify-cfg has anything to merge.

Recommended acceptance-criteria addition: provide a concrete Phase-1 test case the passes flow through end-to-end. E.g.:
```ts
function f(n: number): number {
  if (1 < 2) return n * 2;
  return n;
}
```
- CF: rewrite `br_if(f64.lt(const 1, const 2))` → `br_if(const true)` → `br(ifTrue.target)`
- DCE: remove the now-unreachable else block
- simplify-cfg: merge the entry block with the then block

Any test that exercises this chain should be in `tests/ir/passes.test.ts` (acceptance criterion 2 says "unit test" but doesn't specify end-to-end coverage).

### Minor — not blockers

- Spec line 31 reads "over the SSA use-def chain" but Phase 1 IR has no explicit use-def graph — uses are found by walking instructions/terminators (`lower.ts:293-326` `collectIrUses` / `collectTerminatorUses`). Fine, but dev may look for a use-def index that doesn't exist; mention "walk block.instrs and rebuild use counts on demand".
- `binary` / `unary` ops in `IrInstr` (`nodes.ts:158-182`) are typed by opcode string (`"f64.add"`, `"i32.eq"`, etc.). CF needs a small dispatch table mapping opcode → constant folder. Worth spelling out so the dev doesn't write a giant switch in-line.
- The `raw.wasm` instruction kind (`nodes.ts:216-222`) has side effects via `ops` but no structural info. DCE must treat `raw.wasm` as always-live (conservative).

Otherwise the pass is correctly scoped and implementable against the current `IrInstr` union. The three concerns above should be addressed in a follow-up edit to this issue.
