# Issue #275: Left side of comma operator warning blocks compilation

## Status: done

## Summary
~106 tests fail with "Left side of comma operator is unused and has no side effects" combined with property access errors. TypeScript emits this as a warning/error in strict mode. The diagnostic should be suppressed in allowJs mode since the comma operator is valid JavaScript.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group C

## Complexity: XS

## Scope
- Suppress the "Left side of comma operator is unused" diagnostic in allowJs mode
- Ensure comma operator compilation handles void left-hand side
- Update diagnostic filtering in `src/codegen/index.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Comma operator with unused left side compiles in allowJs mode
- At least 50 compile errors resolved (combined with property errors)

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added TypeScript diagnostic code 2695 ("Left side of comma operator is unused and has no side effects") to the `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` set in `src/compiler.ts`. This downgrades the diagnostic from an error to a warning, allowing compilation to proceed for code using the comma operator with an unused left-hand side.

### Files changed
- `src/compiler.ts` — added code 2695 to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES`

### Tests
- All 20 compiler tests pass
- All 5 comma-operator tests pass
