# Issue 126: valueOf/toString coercion

## Summary

195 test262 tests use user-defined `valueOf` or `toString` methods on objects
for implicit type coercion. Currently all skipped.

## Problem

JS calls `valueOf()`/`toString()` automatically when objects are used in
arithmetic or string contexts. Supporting this requires:
1. Checking for valueOf/toString methods on every arithmetic operation
2. Calling user-defined methods via dynamic dispatch
3. Using the return value as the coerced primitive

## Approach

Could integrate with the `any` type system (#79) — when an `any` value is used
in arithmetic, check for valueOf method before numeric coercion.

## Complexity

L — Requires integration with boxed any dispatch system.
