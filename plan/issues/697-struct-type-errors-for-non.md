# #697 -- Struct type errors for non-class structs (944 CE residual)

## Status: done

### 2026-03-22 Update

Residual count increased from 813 to 944 CE. The increase of 131 is likely due to more tests being attempted (SKIP_DISABLED changes) rather than a true regression. The widenBlockTypesInBody fix remains correct but does not cover all struct type mismatch patterns. Remaining failures likely involve:
- Non-class struct types from interface/anonymous object patterns
- Generic type instantiation producing unexpected struct layouts
- Cross-module struct type references

813 tests fail with struct.new/struct.get/struct.set type errors. #624 fixed class structs but non-class structs (anonymous, interface, widened) still have mismatches.

## Complexity: M

## Implementation Summary

### Root Cause

The `widenNonDefaultableTypes` pass in `src/compiler.ts` widens all `(ref N)` types to `(ref null N)` in function type signatures (params, results), locals, and globals. This is necessary because `ref` types have no default value and locals must be defaultable.

However, this pass was NOT widening block types in instruction bodies (if/block/loop/try). When a helper function like `__any_add` has:
- Function return type widened to `(ref null 4)`
- Internal `if` block type still says `(ref 4)` (non-null)
- Call to `__any_box_i32` returns `(ref null 4)` per its widened signature
- The `if` block expects `(ref 4)` but gets `(ref null 4)` -- type mismatch

This caused `type error in fallthru[0] (expected (ref N), got (ref null N))` for all any-type arithmetic operations in fast mode.

### Fix

Added `widenBlockTypesInBody()` function that recursively walks instruction bodies and widens block types from `ref` to `ref_null`, matching the already-widened function type signatures.

### What worked
- Single 30-line function addition to compiler.ts
- No changes to codegen helpers or signatures (previous reverted attempt changed helper signatures and caused cascading failures)
- Targeted fix: only block types are widened, matching the existing function type widening

### Files changed
- `src/compiler.ts` -- added `widenBlockTypesInBody()` and call it from `widenNonDefaultableTypes()`
- `tests/equivalence/issue-697-struct-type.test.ts` -- 5 new tests for fast-mode any arithmetic

### Test results
- Gradual typing tests: 34 failed -> 5 failed (29 fixed, remaining 5 are runtime null dereference errors)
- Full equivalence suite: 67 failed -> 38 failed (29 fewer failures)
- No regressions in existing passing tests
