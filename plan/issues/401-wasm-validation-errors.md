# #401 — Wasm validation errors (3672 CE)

## Status: open

3672 tests compile to syntactically valid WAT but fail Wasm validation. This is the single biggest CE category.

## Breakdown

| Validation error | Count | % |
|-----------------|------:|---|
| call args missing (wrong number of args on stack) | 648 | 18% |
| struct.new args missing | 541 | 15% |
| local.set type mismatch | 439 | 12% |
| stack not empty at fallthru (missing drop/return) | 352 | 10% |
| call_ref on null ref | 132 | 4% |
| other | 1560 | 42% |

## Details

The compiler generates WAT that parses correctly but fails the Wasm type checker. These are codegen bugs where the compiler emits instructions that leave the stack in an invalid state.

**call args missing (648)**: A `call` or `call_indirect` instruction is emitted but the preceding instructions did not push enough values onto the stack. Common when optional arguments are not filled with defaults.

**struct.new args missing (541)**: `struct.new` is emitted but not all struct fields have been pushed. Happens when object literals have fewer properties than the struct type expects.

**local.set type mismatch (439)**: The value on the stack does not match the declared local type. Often caused by coercion gaps (e.g., externref value assigned to i32 local).

**stack not empty at fallthru (352)**: A block or function body leaves unconsumed values on the stack. Missing `drop` instructions after expressions used as statements.

**call_ref on null ref (132)**: A `call_ref` instruction is used on a reference that could be null. Need to use `ref.as_non_null` or guard with null check.

## Complexity: L

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Reduce Wasm validation CEs by 1500+
- [ ] call args missing reduced by 300+
- [ ] struct.new args missing reduced by 250+
- [ ] local.set type mismatch reduced by 200+
- [ ] stack not empty at fallthru reduced by 150+
