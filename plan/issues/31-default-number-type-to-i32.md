# Issue 31: Default number type to i32, promote to f64 only when needed

## Status: done (implemented as Phase 1 of fast mode, issue #70)

## Summary
Map TypeScript `number` to WASM `i32` by default instead of `f64`. Only promote to `f64` when floating-point operations are actually required (decimal literals, division, `Math.sin`, etc.).

## Motivation
Most TypeScript code is integer-heavy: loop counters, array indices, string lengths, bitwise ops, comparisons. Currently all of these are `f64`, causing constant unnecessary `i32↔f64` conversions at WASM boundaries (e.g. `string.length` returns `i32` per the wasm:js-string spec, but must be converted to `f64` because `number` = `f64`).

Using `i32` by default would:
- Eliminate most conversion instructions
- Enable more efficient WASM codegen (i32 ops are faster than f64)
- Better match the wasm:js-string and DOM API specs which use i32 for counts/indices

## Design

### Triggers for f64 promotion
A variable/expression should use `f64` when any of these apply:
- Decimal literal (`3.14`, `1.5`)
- Division operator (`/`) — result may be fractional
- `Math.*` functions that return floats (`sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `random`, `exp`, `log`, etc.)
- Explicit cast or assignment from a known f64 source
- Function parameter/return typed as f64 by external signature

### What stays i32
- Integer literals (`42`, `0xFF`)
- `string.length`, `array.length`
- Loop counters (`for (let i = 0; ...)`)
- Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`)
- Comparisons returning boolean-like values
- Arithmetic on two i32 values (`+`, `-`, `*`, `%`)

### Propagation rules
- Binary op: if either operand is f64, result is f64 (promote the i32 side)
- Assignment: if target is f64, coerce i32 source
- Function call: coerce args to match callee signature
- Return: coerce to function's declared return type (already fixed in #31-prereq)

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — type resolution for literals, binary ops, property access
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — `resolveWasmType()` and function signature generation
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — variable declarations, assignments
- Tests: update existing tests, add `tests/i32-default.test.ts`

## Complexity: L

## Prerequisites
- Return type coercion (already implemented: `compileReturnStatement` passes `fctx.returnType` to `compileExpression`)

## Acceptance criteria
- `let x = 5; return x;` uses i32 locals, no f64 conversion
- `string.length` stays i32 without coercion when used in i32 context
- `let x = 3.14` uses f64
- `let x = 10 / 3` uses f64
- `Math.sin(x)` promotes x to f64 if needed
- All existing tests pass
- Benchmark shows measurable improvement for integer-heavy code
