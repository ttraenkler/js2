# #857 -- wasm_compile: "fn is not a function" in Array callback methods (247 tests)

## Problem

247 tests fail at Wasm instantiation time with "fn is not a function". The compiled module references a function import that was not provided at instantiation. These are all Array.prototype callback methods (every, filter, forEach, map, some, reduce, indexOf, lastIndexOf) where the callback function argument is not resolved at compile time.

Note: This overlaps with #827 (Array callback methods) but focuses on the 247 Wasm compile errors, not the runtime failures.

### Sample files with exact errors

**1. Array.prototype.every with non-function callback**
File: `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/every/15.4.4.16-5-1-s.js`
Error: `fn is not a function`

File: `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/every/15.4.4.16-5-1.js`
Error: `fn is not a function`

File: `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/every/15.4.4.16-5-10.js`
Error: `fn is not a function`

**2. Array.prototype.filter with non-function callback**
File: `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/filter/15.4.4.20-5-1.js`
Error: `fn is not a function`

**3. Array.prototype.forEach with non-function callback**
File: `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/forEach/15.4.4.18-5-1.js`
Error: `fn is not a function`

### Root cause

In `src/codegen/expressions.ts`, when compiling `arr.every(callback)`, `arr.map(callback)`, etc., the compiler resolves `callback` at compile time as a function reference. When the test passes a non-function value (to test that TypeError is thrown), the compile-time resolution fails with "fn is not a function".

The tests expect:
```js
[1, 2].every(undefined); // should throw TypeError at runtime
[1, 2].map("not a function"); // should throw TypeError at runtime
```

But the compiler tries to resolve the callback as a Wasm function reference at compile time and fails.

### Breakdown by method

| Method | Count |
|--------|-------|
| every | ~40 |
| filter | ~35 |
| forEach | ~35 |
| map | ~35 |
| some | ~30 |
| reduce/reduceRight | ~30 |
| indexOf/lastIndexOf | ~20 |
| find/findIndex | ~12 |
| Other | ~10 |

## Suggested fix

In `src/codegen/expressions.ts`:
1. When the callback argument is not a known function, do NOT reject at compile time
2. Instead, emit runtime type checking:
   - Check if the callback is callable (via `ref.test` or host import)
   - If not callable, throw TypeError at runtime
3. For known function callbacks, continue to use the optimized compile-time path

## Acceptance criteria

- Array callback methods accept non-function arguments without compile error
- Non-function callbacks throw TypeError at runtime
- >=200 of 247 tests fixed (should become runtime failures or passes)

## Resolution

**Fixed by #827** (merged 2026-03-29). Full scan of all Array callback test262 tests confirmed 0 "fn is not a function" wasm errors remain:
- every: 205 OK, 1 CE, 12 wasm-other (of 218)
- forEach: 175 OK, 1 CE, 14 wasm-other (of 190)
- filter: 213 OK, 1 CE, 28 wasm-other (of 242)
- map: 186 OK, 1 CE, 29 wasm-other (of 216)
- some: 205 OK, 1 CE, 13 wasm-other (of 219)
- reduce: 191 OK, 1 CE, 68 wasm-other (of 260)
- reduceRight: 253 OK, 1 CE, 6 wasm-other (of 260)
- find: 9 OK, 1 CE, 13 wasm-other (of 23)
- findIndex: 9 OK, 1 CE, 13 wasm-other (of 23)
- **Total: 1,446 OK, 9 CE, 0 fn-errors, 196 wasm-other**

The `isKnownNonCallable` + `emitCallbackTypeCheck` additions in #827's array-methods.ts fix resolved all 247 original "fn is not a function" errors. Remaining 196 wasm-other errors are different patterns (type mismatch, struct.get, etc).
