# #878 -- Dashboard: active agent status panel

## Problem

The dashboard shows sprint metrics but not which agents are currently running, what task they're on, or how long they've been active.

## Requirements

- Show each active agent: name, role, current task, uptime
- Data source: `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json` for team members
- Cross-reference with TaskList to show current task per agent
- Auto-refresh via existing WebSocket

## Acceptance criteria

- Panel shows active agents with name and current task
- Updates when agents start/stop
