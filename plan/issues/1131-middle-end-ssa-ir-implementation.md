# #1131 — Middle-end SSA IR: implementation plan

## Status: open

## Context

Issue [#1124](../sprints/42/1124.md) audited the current compiler and concluded
that a minimal SSA middle-end IR should be **inserted** between the TypeScript
checker and the current Wasm backend IR. The current-state analysis in
`#1124 ## Current State Analysis (no-IR)` documents why: 10 post-hoc repair
passes totalling ~4,100 lines, a stateful `FunctionContext` that dumps flow
facts into ad-hoc Sets/Maps, raw function-index plumbing (`addUnionImports` +
`shiftLateImportIndices`) that has to walk every compiled body on every late
import, and call-site facts that evaporate the moment a call is lowered.

This issue is the **implementation plan**. It is opinionated and specific
enough that a developer can start Phase 1 without further design work. The
earlier design sketches in `#1124 ## Proposed minimal SSA IR` are the starting
point; this issue turns them into a migration plan.

## TL;DR

- IR shape: **linear SSA with block arguments, explicit CFG, symbolic refs**.
  No sea-of-nodes, no phi-with-predecessor lists. Rationale: Wasm is
  structured and our backend already groups instructions by block — matching
  shape keeps lowering short.
- Migration: **incremental, flag-gated per-function, no flag day**. A new
  function-level selector routes small/typed functions through the IR; the
  existing AST→Wasm path is the fallback. Coverage ratchets up as features
  land.
- First repair pass to die: **`shiftLateImportIndices`** (Phase 1). The IR
  holds symbolic `FuncRef` until the final SSA→Wasm lowering, so late imports
  don't need to rewrite anything.
- Target correctness invariant: **"a function compiled through the IR must
  produce a bit-identical or semantically-equivalent module to the AST→Wasm
  path before its divergence test crosses the acceptance threshold"**. We
  keep the AST→Wasm path alive until the IR reaches parity.

## 1. What the IR is

### 1.1 Shape: linear SSA with block arguments

Picked over three alternatives:

| Shape | Why rejected |
|-------|--------------|
| Sea-of-Nodes (V8-TurboFan-style) | Optimizes well, but lowering to structured Wasm requires regeneration of a CFG. We'd pay the CFG cost twice. |
| Phi nodes with predecessor lists (LLVM-style) | Works, but block arguments map 1:1 onto Wasm block result types, which we already use. Phi nodes would need a rewriter at lowering time. |
| Non-SSA / mutable locals | What we have today. Defeats the purpose — no stable values to attach facts to. |

**Linear SSA with block arguments** wins: each basic block carries explicit
parameters, terminators pass values into successor blocks as block arguments,
and every instruction defines exactly one value (`IrValue`). This maps
directly onto Wasm's structured blocks with result types and onto the future
WasmGC `block_param` proposals if we ever adopt them.

### 1.2 The core types

Extends the sketch in `#1124 ## Proposed minimal SSA IR`. Concretely, create
a **new directory** `src/ir-mid/` and put everything under it. Do **not**
repurpose `src/ir/` — it is the backend Wasm IR and stays where it is.

```ts
// src/ir-mid/types.ts

/** A symbolic value. Never a raw index. */
export interface IrValue {
  readonly id: number;          // unique within a function
  readonly type: IrType;        // stable type at definition site
  readonly origin?: ts.Node;    // for error reporting
}

/** A symbolic function reference. Resolved to funcIdx only at lowering. */
export interface IrFuncRef {
  readonly id: string;          // module-unique, e.g. "fib", "__box_number"
  readonly signature: IrSignature;
  readonly kind: "local" | "import";
}

/** A symbolic global reference. Same pattern. */
export interface IrGlobalRef {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly type: IrType;
  readonly mutable: boolean;
}

/** A symbolic type reference (struct, array). Same pattern. */
export interface IrTypeRef {
  readonly id: string;          // e.g. "$closure_add_f64_f64"
}

export type IrType =
  | { kind: "never" }
  | { kind: "undefined" }
  | { kind: "bool" }
  | { kind: "i32" }
  | { kind: "i64" }
  | { kind: "f64" }
  | { kind: "string" }
  | { kind: "object"; shape: IrTypeRef }
  | { kind: "function"; target: IrFuncRef }
  | { kind: "closure"; target: IrFuncRef; captures: IrType[] }
  | { kind: "boxed"; inner: IrType }
  | { kind: "union"; members: IrType[] }   // kept ordered + canonicalized
  | { kind: "dynamic" };                   // last-resort, becomes externref

export interface IrFunction {
  readonly ref: IrFuncRef;
  readonly params: IrValue[];
  readonly returnType: IrType;
  readonly entry: IrBlockId;
  readonly blocks: Map<IrBlockId, IrBlock>;
  readonly source: ts.Node;
}

export type IrBlockId = number & { __br: "block" };

export interface IrBlock {
  readonly id: IrBlockId;
  readonly params: IrValue[];           // block arguments
  readonly instructions: IrInstr[];
  readonly terminator: IrTerminator;
}

export type IrInstr =
  | { kind: "const"; out: IrValue; value: IrConst }
  | { kind: "prim"; out: IrValue; op: IrPrimOp; args: IrValue[] }
  | { kind: "get_local"; out: IrValue; slot: number }            // only before SSA
  | { kind: "set_local"; slot: number; value: IrValue }          // only before SSA
  | { kind: "get_global"; out: IrValue; target: IrGlobalRef }
  | { kind: "set_global"; target: IrGlobalRef; value: IrValue }
  | { kind: "get_prop"; out: IrValue; object: IrValue; key: IrKey }
  | { kind: "set_prop"; object: IrValue; key: IrKey; value: IrValue }
  | { kind: "call"; out?: IrValue; target: IrCallTarget; args: IrValue[]; site: IrSiteId }
  | { kind: "closure"; out: IrValue; target: IrFuncRef; captures: IrValue[] }
  | { kind: "box"; out: IrValue; value: IrValue }                // explicit boundary
  | { kind: "unbox"; out: IrValue; value: IrValue; to: IrType }  // explicit boundary
  | { kind: "type_test"; out: IrValue; value: IrValue; test: IrTypeTest }
  | { kind: "narrow"; out: IrValue; value: IrValue; to: IrType }; // refinement

export type IrTerminator =
  | { kind: "return"; value?: IrValue }
  | { kind: "branch"; target: IrBlockId; args: IrValue[] }
  | { kind: "cond_branch"; cond: IrValue; thenB: IrBlockId; thenArgs: IrValue[]; elseB: IrBlockId; elseArgs: IrValue[] }
  | { kind: "switch"; value: IrValue; cases: { match: IrConst; target: IrBlockId; args: IrValue[] }[]; default: IrBlockId; defaultArgs: IrValue[] }
  | { kind: "throw"; value: IrValue }
  | { kind: "unreachable" };

export interface IrCallTarget {
  readonly kind: "direct" | "closure" | "indirect" | "host";
  readonly ref?: IrFuncRef;   // direct/host
  readonly closure?: IrValue; // closure/indirect
}

export interface IrSiteId { readonly id: string; }  // "fn:block:idx"

export type IrConst =
  | { kind: "i32"; value: number }
  | { kind: "i64"; value: bigint }
  | { kind: "f64"; value: number }
  | { kind: "bool"; value: boolean }
  | { kind: "string"; value: string }
  | { kind: "undefined" }
  | { kind: "null" };

export type IrPrimOp =
  | "add" | "sub" | "mul" | "div" | "mod"
  | "eq"  | "ne"  | "lt"  | "le"  | "gt" | "ge"
  | "and" | "or"  | "xor" | "shl" | "shr_s" | "shr_u"
  | "neg" | "not";

export type IrKey = { kind: "const"; name: string } | { kind: "dynamic"; value: IrValue };

export type IrTypeTest =
  | { kind: "typeof"; expected: "number" | "string" | "boolean" | "object" | "function" | "undefined" }
  | { kind: "instance_of"; target: IrTypeRef };
```

### 1.3 Invariants enforced by the IR

All of these should be checked by a debug-mode `verifyIrFunction(fn)` that
runs in tests and under `--debug-ir`. Violations are compiler bugs.

1. **Every `IrValue` is defined exactly once.** (SSA.) The verifier walks the
   function and errors on duplicate definitions.
2. **Every use of a value dominates its definition.** (Classic SSA dominance
   property. Makes DCE + constant folding trivially safe.)
3. **Every branch's argument list matches the target block's parameter arity
   and types.** This is what replaces the `stack-balance.ts` repair pass.
4. **`get_prop`/`set_prop` on a non-`dynamic` `object`-typed value must name
   a key that exists in that shape.** Otherwise the type is wrong — either
   widen to `dynamic` first or use `type_test` to narrow.
5. **`box` / `unbox` are the only sites that cross the typed ↔ dynamic
   boundary.** No other instruction may silently coerce. This is what
   replaces the `repairStructTypeMismatches` repair pass.
6. **All references are symbolic (`IrFuncRef`, `IrGlobalRef`, `IrTypeRef`)
   until the lowering phase.** Raw `funcIdx: number` does not appear in the
   IR. This is what replaces `shiftLateImportIndices`.
7. **Terminators appear exactly once per block, at the end.** No fall-through
   between blocks.
8. **Block arguments are the only way values cross block boundaries.** No
   implicit stack, no implicit `local.get`.

### 1.4 What the IR deliberately does **not** do

- **No explicit stack.** The backend Wasm IR is stack-based; the middle end
  is SSA. Lowering inserts the stack.
- **No phi nodes.** Block arguments subsume them.
- **No loop-header canonicalization up front.** Loops are `cond_branch`
  pointing back at a block; if later passes want natural loops, they can
  reconstruct them from the CFG.
- **No type inference solver baked into the IR types.** The IR is a data
  structure. The solver lives in a separate module (`src/ir-mid/passes/`).

## 2. Migration from the current architecture

### 2.1 Migration strategy: function-level selector, no flag day

Insert a new stage in `src/compiler.ts` after the TS checker runs and before
`generateModule`. For each function in the AST, decide: "compile via IR or
via the legacy path?" The selector starts conservative and widens.

```ts
// src/compiler.ts (new code, after line ~86 where `ast` is available)
const irReport = planIrCompilation(ast, {
  enabledFeatures: options.middleEnd?.enabledFeatures ?? DEFAULT_IR_FEATURES,
});
// irReport.usesIr: Set<ts.Node> -- functions compiled via IR
// irReport.usesLegacy: Set<ts.Node> -- functions compiled via AST->Wasm
```

The selector is **opt-in per function by AST shape**, not by a global flag.
A function qualifies when all of these are true:

- Body uses only features the current IR supports (Phase 1: numeric/bool
  arithmetic, comparisons, direct calls, returns, if/else, while/for).
- No closures, no `try`/`catch`/`finally`, no generators, no
  destructuring. (Each feature opens up separately as phases land.)
- No property access whose object type is `dynamic`.

If any check fails, the function falls back to the legacy path. The legacy
path stays alive indefinitely and is always the correctness backstop.

### 2.2 Divergence detection as a CI gate

Until the IR path achieves feature parity, we need confidence that the two
paths produce equivalent modules. Add:

- `npm test -- tests/ir-divergence.test.ts` — for each fixture in
  `tests/equivalence.test.ts`, compile once with `middleEnd: { force: true,
  fallbackOnError: false }` and once with `middleEnd: { force: false }`.
  Both must produce modules whose exported functions agree on all
  fixture inputs. Disagreement is a blocking test failure.
- CI runs divergence tests on every PR.
- Test262 regression gate: the IR path must not reduce overall pass rate
  on any PR. Since the selector defaults off for anything not explicitly
  covered, this starts as trivially satisfied and gets harder as coverage
  grows.

### 2.3 Order in which repair passes die

Each repair pass disappears (or shrinks) once the IR covers all the
features that produced the mismatches it was fixing. Priority order:

| Order | Pass | Disappears because |
|-------|------|--------------------|
| 1 | `shiftLateImportIndices` (`expressions/late-imports.ts:20`) | IR uses symbolic `IrFuncRef`. Lowering resolves refs to indices in one deterministic pass after all imports are known. No more rewriting bodies mid-compilation. |
| 2 | `savedBody` swap pattern (40+ call sites) | IR builder emits into an explicit block structure. No need to swap a shared `fctx.body` array. |
| 3 | `repairStructTypeMismatches` (`fixups.ts:65–`) | Invariant 5 (`box`/`unbox` are the only typed↔dynamic sites) makes the mismatch unrepresentable in the IR. Lowering emits the correct ref.cast + any.convert_extern automatically. |
| 4 | `fixupExternConvertAny` (`index.ts:377`) | Same reason: no late-emitted `extern.convert_any` because the lowering pass decides coercions from IR types, not from the emitted instruction stream. |
| 5 | `stackBalance` (`stack-balance.ts`, 2,512 lines) | Invariants 3 and 7 (block args match, terminators exactly once) mean the lowering pass cannot emit unbalanced branches. Keep the pass initially as a debug-only assertion; delete after one release cycle of clean runs. |
| 6 | `fixupStructNewArgCounts` + `fixupStructNewResultCoercion` (`fixups.ts`) | IR `closure` / object construction records the full field list symbolically. Lowering emits `struct.new` with the right arity. |
| 7 | `peepholeOptimize` (`peephole.ts`) | Partly: the `ref.as_non_null`-after-`ref.cast` and `local.tee;drop` patterns come from lowering choices. The IR lowering can avoid them by construction. Postfix-increment dead-store goes away when `set_local` in SSA form drops the unused value explicitly. Keep peephole as a final polish pass if measurements justify it. |
| 8 | `dead-elimination.ts` | Kept. It operates on the final Wasm IR and is correct there. |

### 2.4 What happens to `FunctionContext`

The existing `FunctionContext` (`src/codegen/context/types.ts:94–185`) has
two overlapping responsibilities: (a) holding the emitter's in-progress
instruction stream + backend state, and (b) holding flow facts
(`narrowedNonNull`, `safeIndexedArrays`, `tdzFlagLocals`,
`boxedCaptures`, etc.).

**Split it.**

- `FunctionContext` stays, but narrows to backend-lowering state only:
  `body: Instr[]`, `locals`, `localMap`, `blockDepth`, `breakStack`,
  `continueStack`, `labelMap`, `savedBodies` (for the legacy path).
- All flow-fact fields move onto IR nodes or into pass-scoped state:
  - `narrowedNonNull` → `narrow` IR instruction. Narrowing is a dataflow
    fact attached to a value, not to a name.
  - `safeIndexedArrays` → an analysis pass result keyed on `IrValue`.
  - `tdzFlagLocals` → TDZ lowering pass emits `type_test` +
    `cond_branch` to a throw block. No longer a global flag.
  - `boxedCaptures` → `closure` IR instruction captures are typed
    directly; ref cells are an SSA→Wasm lowering choice.
  - `pendingCallbackWritebacks` / `persistentCallbackWritebacks` →
    explicit `set_prop`/`set_local` at the call site. No more
    side-channel writeback queues.
  - `catchRethrowStack` → catch-block structure in the CFG; the rethrow
    is a `throw` terminator whose value is the caught exception.
  - `finallyStack` → compile-time expansion: clone the finally block
    before each early exit. This is what the legacy path already does,
    but in the IR the clone is on IR nodes so it verifies.

### 2.5 What happens to `addUnionImports` / `shiftLateImportIndices`

They disappear for IR-path functions. Concretely:

- The IR builder never calls `addImport` or `addFuncType` directly. It
  records "I need the `__box_number` host import" as an `IrFuncRef` with
  `kind: "import"` and `id: "__box_number"`.
- The lowering pass (`src/ir-mid/lower/`) collects all referenced
  `IrFuncRef`s from all IR functions, deduplicates, and emits imports
  first, then user functions. Function indices are assigned exactly once.
- No walk-every-body, no `shiftLateImportIndices`.

For legacy-path functions, `addUnionImports` stays as-is. When a module
contains a mix, the lowering pass emits the IR imports first, then the
legacy path runs and any late imports it adds still use the old
shifting machinery — but only over the legacy-path bodies, not the
IR-path bodies (the IR-path bodies are already lowered with correct
indices and never change).

## 3. Implementation phases

### Phase 1: the minimum that kills one repair pass

**Scope.** Implement an IR for functions that look like:

```ts
function add(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; }
function factorial(n: number): number {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

That is: typed parameters, numeric/bool arithmetic, comparisons, `if`,
`while`, `for`, direct calls, `return`. **No closures, no objects, no
destructuring, no exceptions, no generators.**

**Deliverables.**

1. `src/ir-mid/types.ts` — the core types from §1.2.
2. `src/ir-mid/builder.ts` — `buildIrFunction(ast: ts.FunctionDeclaration,
   checker: ts.TypeChecker): IrFunction`. Only succeeds for Phase-1-shape
   functions; throws `IrUnsupportedError` otherwise.
3. `src/ir-mid/verify.ts` — `verifyIrFunction(fn)` that checks invariants
   1–8. Runs in tests and `--debug-ir`.
4. `src/ir-mid/lower/index.ts` — `lowerIrFunction(fn, ctx): WasmFunction`.
   Produces a `WasmFunction` using the existing `src/ir/types.ts` shapes.
5. `src/ir-mid/select.ts` — `planIrCompilation(ast)` returning
   `{ usesIr: Set<ts.Node>; usesLegacy: Set<ts.Node> }`.
6. `src/compiler.ts` hook — after checker, before `generateModule`, run
   the selector and attach the result to `ctx`. `generateModule` reads
   the set and routes each function accordingly.
7. `tests/ir-phase1.test.ts` — fixtures for every supported construct,
   asserting IR-verified and Wasm-equivalent to legacy.
8. `tests/ir-divergence.test.ts` — reused across phases; Phase 1 adds the
   Phase-1-shape fixtures to it.

**Repair pass killed.** `shiftLateImportIndices` still runs for legacy-path
functions, but IR-path functions add their imports through the lowering
pass and never trigger a shift. For a Phase-1-pure module, the function
becomes a no-op. Measure this in benchmarks (see Phase 1 success criteria).

**Success criteria.**

- `buildIrFunction` + `verifyIrFunction` + `lowerIrFunction` produce a
  module byte-identical to the legacy path for 90%+ of Phase-1-shape
  fixtures. (Some divergence is acceptable — e.g. different local ordering
  — as long as semantics match.)
- `npm test` green, test262 pass rate unchanged (should be — the selector
  is conservative and the divergence gate catches any slip).
- On a synthetic benchmark with N late imports in a Phase-1-pure module,
  total compilation time drops by a measurable amount (late imports no
  longer trigger full-body walks).

**Estimated size.** Two to three weeks of focused work. Most of the
complexity is in `builder.ts` (~800 lines) and `lower/index.ts` (~1,200
lines). The rest is small.

### Phase 2: enough IR to enable the first interprocedural pass

**Scope.** Expand the IR to cover closures and direct + indirect calls
with full call-site metadata. Introduce the call graph. Run one
interprocedural pass: parameter/return type propagation over direct calls
(the "numeric recursive kernel" case from #1121).

**New features added to the builder.**

- Arrow functions and function expressions → `IrInstr.closure`.
- Captures represented as SSA values at the closure site.
- Indirect calls through closure values.
- Arguments to calls record `IrSiteId` and the builder's best guess at
  `inferredArgTypes` (seeded from the TS checker).
- Exceptions (`try`/`catch`/`finally`) — catch blocks are CFG nodes;
  `throw` is a terminator; `finally` is cloned on early exits.

**New passes.**

1. `src/ir-mid/passes/call-graph.ts` — `buildCallGraph(module): CallGraph`.
   Nodes are `IrFuncRef`s; edges are call sites with argument/return types.
2. `src/ir-mid/passes/type-propagation.ts` —
   `propagateTypes(module, graph): TypeMap`. Context-insensitive solver:
   forward-propagate arg types into callee params, backward-propagate
   return types, iterate to fixpoint on the finite type lattice from §1.2.
3. `src/ir-mid/passes/apply-inference.ts` — rewrite `IrFunction`s whose
   parameter/return types were refined by the solver. This is where the
   `fib(n: any) → f64` narrowing actually happens.

**Repair passes killed or shrunk.**

- `savedBody` swap pattern: IR-path functions no longer use it.
- `repairStructTypeMismatches`: IR-path closures never emit the
  externref-at-struct-site pattern.
- `fixupExternConvertAny`: IR-path lowering never emits invalid coercions.

**Success criteria.**

- `#1121` — `fib-recursive.js` with untyped `fib` compiles to f64 through
  the IR path, with no externref roundtrip in the inner loop.
- Test262 pass rate on the numeric subset increases by at least 0.5
  percentage points (CE cases where untyped numeric helpers caused
  externref propagation).
- Divergence gate still green; legacy path is still the correctness
  backstop for anything Phase 2 doesn't cover.

**Estimated size.** Four to six weeks. The solver is ~500 lines if
kept simple. Rewriting functions after inference is ~800 lines. Exception
handling in the builder is the biggest addition (~600 lines).

### Phase 3: optimization passes, monomorphization, escape analysis

**Scope.** With call graph + type facts in place, the IR becomes the
host for the optimization work filed under the `performance` goal.

**New passes, in dependency order.**

1. `passes/inline-small.ts` — replaces the current `InlinableFunctionInfo`
   mechanism (`src/codegen/context/types.ts:70–79`). Inlining on the IR
   instead of on already-emitted `Instr[]` means inlined bodies
   participate in propagation.
2. `passes/monomorphize.ts` — `#744`. When a direct call's argument types
   disagree across call sites, clone the callee for each consistent type
   signature. Clones have distinct `IrFuncRef`s and flow through lowering
   as separate functions.
3. `passes/tagged-unions.ts` — `#745`. When a value's type is a
   `union` whose members all map to Wasm-representable types, represent
   it as a WasmGC struct with a tag field instead of externref. The IR
   `box`/`unbox` lowering becomes a branch on the tag, no host calls.
4. `passes/escape-analysis.ts` — `#747`. Mark allocations whose
   resulting values don't escape their enclosing function. Allocation
   sites marked non-escaping lower to stack-equivalent structures
   (future work; may need Wasm proposal support).
5. `passes/constant-fold.ts` — straightforward on SSA. Replaces any
   remaining ad-hoc constant handling in the AST→Wasm path.
6. `passes/dead-code.ts` — eliminates unreachable blocks and unused
   values. Distinct from `dead-elimination.ts` on the backend IR,
   which handles dead imports/types.

**Repair passes killed.**

- `stackBalance` — downgrade to debug-only assertion, then delete.
- `fixupStructNewArgCounts` / `fixupStructNewResultCoercion` — gone
  for IR-path modules.
- `peepholeOptimize` — most patterns eliminated by construction;
  retain the few that still give wins in measurement.

**Success criteria.**

- Each of `#743`, `#744`, `#745`, `#747`, `#904`, `#1121`, `#1126`
  implementable as a pass in `src/ir-mid/passes/`.
- AST→Wasm legacy path still passes equivalence tests; divergence gate
  green.
- Test262 pass rate goal: low-to-mid 60s (up from 52%), realized
  through the propagation + monomorphization wins.

**Estimated size.** Multi-sprint effort. Each pass is independently
dispatchable once the IR infra is stable.

### 4.2 Existing files modified

`src/compiler.ts` (lines ~82–120)

- After `analyzeSource(...)` completes, call `planIrCompilation(ast,
  options.middleEnd)`.
- Pass the plan into `generateModule(ast, options, plan)` as a new
  optional argument.

`src/codegen/index.ts::generateModule` (lines 194–385)

- Accept `irPlan?: IrPlan` argument.
- In `compileDeclarations` loop: for each function, check
  `irPlan?.usesIr.has(fn)`. If yes, route to
  `lowerIrFunction(buildIrFunction(fn, checker), ctx)` and push result
  into `ctx.mod.functions`. If no, fall through to existing
  `compileFunctionDeclaration`.
- **No other changes to this file in Phase 1.** Keep the ten repair
  passes intact — they correctly no-op on IR-path functions because the
  IR-path functions don't produce the patterns they fix.

`src/codegen/context/types.ts` (lines 94–185)

- Phase 1: no change. The IR has its own context type.
- Phase 2: begin migrating flow-fact fields off `FunctionContext` as
  they are no longer used by IR-path code. Legacy path keeps them.

`src/compiler/import-manifest.ts`, `src/codegen/registry/imports.ts`

- Lowering calls `addImport` once per referenced `IrFuncRef`, at the
  start of lowering, before any `WasmFunction` is written. This is the
  "late imports die" moment for IR-path code.

`src/ir/types.ts` (`WasmFunction`, `Instr`, `ValType`)

- **No changes.** The backend IR is the contract at the lowering output
  boundary. Lowering writes into it using its existing shape.

### 4.3 Files that do **not** change

- `src/emit/wat.ts`, `src/emit/binary.ts`, `src/emit/object.ts` — they
  consume `WasmModule` and don't care where it came from.
- `src/codegen/peephole.ts`, `src/codegen/dead-elimination.ts`,
  `src/codegen/stack-balance.ts` — these operate on the final
  `WasmModule` and remain in place through Phase 1. Phase 2+ shrinks
  them.

## 5. Risk surface

### 5.1 What breaks during the transition

- **IR-path and legacy-path emit slightly different Wasm for the same
  function.** Expected in many cases (different local ordering, different
  block type ordering). The divergence gate compares *behavior on
  fixture inputs*, not bytes, to accommodate this. Risk: a divergence
  that passes the fixtures but fails an uncovered edge case. Mitigation:
  Phase 1 is narrow; divergence fixtures are comprehensive; legacy path
  is always the fallback.
- **Performance regression during Phase 1.** Possible if IR build +
  lower adds compile-time overhead on functions that were fine under
  the legacy path. Mitigation: bench compile time on a representative
  corpus before and after Phase 1, set a regression budget
  (e.g. ≤ 10% compile-time increase for Phase-1-covered functions).
- **Verification finds real bugs in existing features.** Likely. When the
  IR enforces SSA dominance and the builder lowers a corner case
  incorrectly, `verifyIrFunction` catches it. Mitigation: these are
  *good* failures — the builder is wrong, not the verifier. Fix the
  builder.
- **Legacy-path features accidentally regress.** The legacy path is not
  touched in Phase 1 except for the entry routing change. Risk is low.
  Full test262 on every PR remains the safety net.

### 5.2 Keeping test262 non-decreasing

- Selector defaults **off** for any feature the IR doesn't support yet.
  Anything the selector rejects keeps going through the legacy path,
  which has not changed.
- Divergence gate is a hard CI stop: any IR-path output that doesn't
  match the legacy-path output on fixture inputs blocks the PR.
- Test262 regression gate: `build:pages` already diffs pass rates
  against baseline. Any drop of more than 20 tests blocks merge.

### 5.3 Correctness invariants that are hard to enforce

- **SSA dominance under exceptions.** A value defined in a `try` block
  does not dominate uses in the `catch` block because the `try` may
  have thrown before reaching the definition. Solution: the builder
  lifts dominance-violating values into block parameters of the catch
  block. Phase 2 spec includes this construction.
- **`finally` semantics under early exits.** Every `return`/`break`/
  `continue`/`throw` that exits a `try` with a `finally` must execute
  the finally first. In SSA this is a clone-on-exit. Clone explosion
  on deeply nested try/finally is a theoretical concern; measure before
  optimizing.
- **Observable ordering of side effects.** SSA lets passes reorder
  operations freely. For calls (which may have any side effect) and
  `get_prop`/`set_prop` (which may invoke getters/setters) we must
  preserve program order. Solution: treat calls and dynamic property
  access as effectful nodes that cannot be reordered across each other.
  Document this as an invariant; the passes in Phase 3 must respect it.
- **Import ordering.** The lowering pass collects `IrFuncRef`s in a
  deterministic order (by `.id`) before emitting imports. Ensures
  module bytes are reproducible even when IR pass ordering changes.

### 5.4 What we are not building

- **No JIT, no runtime recompilation.** All IR analysis is
  ahead-of-time.
- **No context-sensitive cloning in Phase 2.** Context-insensitive
  propagation only. Context sensitivity can be added as a Phase 3+
  pass when the need is demonstrated.
- **No full type-inference replacement for the TS checker.** The
  checker remains authoritative for annotated code. The IR only
  refines types that the checker left as `any`/`unknown`/widened.

## 6. Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Phase 1 lands: IR, builder, verifier, lowering, selector,
  divergence tests, all green.
- [ ] At least one repair pass (`shiftLateImportIndices`) is effectively
  unused for Phase-1-covered modules, demonstrated by benchmark.
- [ ] Legacy path untouched for non-Phase-1 features; test262 pass
  rate non-decreasing.
- [ ] Phase 2 spec ready for dispatch as a separate issue once Phase 1
  is stable.

## 7. What to do first (Phase 1, week 1)

1. Write `src/ir-mid/types.ts` exactly as in §1.2. No logic yet.
2. Write `src/ir-mid/verify.ts` checking invariants 1–3 and 7–8.
3. Write `src/ir-mid/builder.ts` that handles `FunctionDeclaration` with
   only numeric-literal returns (`function f(): number { return 42; }`).
   Trivial, but exercises the full pipeline end-to-end.
4. Write `src/ir-mid/lower/index.ts` handling that same trivial shape.
5. Hook into `src/compiler.ts` and `src/codegen/index.ts`.
6. First divergence test: the trivial function. Should produce a
   working Wasm module byte-compatible with the legacy path (or at
   least semantically equivalent).

That is a working end-to-end slice in 1–2 days for a developer who has
read this issue and #1124. Each subsequent Phase-1 feature (binary ops,
comparisons, `if`, `while`, direct calls) is then a localized extension
in `builder.ts` + `lower/index.ts` + one divergence fixture.

## Merge Resolution Plan

_Added 2026-04-21 by architect. Covers PR #231 (`feat/ir`) → `main`._

### TL;DR

- **Exactly one** real textual conflict exists: `src/index.ts` `CompileOptions`
  interface — both branches independently add a field after `optimize?:`.
  Keep **both** additions.
- `src/codegen/index.ts` and `src/compiler.ts` are reported by `git merge-tree`
  as "changed in both" but auto-merge cleanly — adjacent hunks, no overlap.
  Verify the IR hook call site post-merge; it should land at the same
  position (right after `compileDeclarations(ctx, ast.sourceFile)`).
- All other conflicts are **planning-artifact noise**: CI status JSONs,
  issue file moves (`ready/` → `done/`, `sprints/42/` → `sprints/43/`),
  new agent-context files, and new test files. Standard "take theirs
  (main)" rule from the team-lead protocol.
- **One architectural concern** surfaced during review: PR #231 placed the
  middle-end IR files under `src/ir/` alongside the existing backend-IR
  file `src/ir/types.ts`. Issue #1131 §1.2 explicitly instructed
  `src/ir-mid/`. This is **not** a merge blocker but should be resolved
  in a follow-up rename PR (see "Architectural risks" below).
- No source-level conflicts inside `src/ir/*.ts` (main did not modify
  them beyond the unchanged `types.ts` + `index.ts` re-export stub).

### Verification method

Conflict surface was computed with:

```
git merge-tree $(git merge-base origin/main origin/feat/ir) \
    origin/feat/ir origin/main > /tmp/merge-tree-output.txt
```

The only occurrence of `<<<<<<< .our` / `>>>>>>> .their` in the entire
277,960-line output is in `src/index.ts` at CompileOptions line ~139.
Everything else is auto-resolved by git's three-way merge.

### Per-file resolution

#### Source files

**1. `src/index.ts`** — 🔴 **real textual conflict, keep both sides**

`CompileOptions` interface in both branches adds a new field immediately
after `optimize?: boolean | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;`:

- Branch (`feat/ir`, commit `587e811d6`) adds `experimentalIR?: boolean`
- Main (commit `d3a50c23c` via PR #186 / issue #1043) adds
  `define?: Record<string, string>`

Resolution: keep **both** additions, in the order
`experimentalIR` first, then `define` (matches lexical arrival on branch).
Final block should look like:

```ts
  optimize?: boolean | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;
  /**
   * Experimental: route a narrow set of functions through the middle-end IR
   * (see `src/ir/`). Defaults to off. Ship as off until the IR reaches
   * parity with the legacy direct-emission path.
   */
  experimentalIR?: boolean;
  /** Compile-time constant definitions. Substitutes identifiers/dotted paths with literal values
   *  before TypeScript parsing. Example: `{ "process.env.NODE_ENV": '"production"' }`.
   *  Values must be valid JS expression literals (strings need inner quotes).
   *  Also supports shorthand: `"production"` mode sets process.env.NODE_ENV and typeof guards. */
  define?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

No downstream wiring is needed for `define` — it flows through
`applyDefineSubstitutions` in `src/compiler/define-substitution.ts` (new
file added by main, see below). No downstream wiring is needed for
`experimentalIR` either — it is already threaded through `compileSource`
(`src/compiler.ts:281`) and `generateModule` (`src/codegen/index.ts:286`)
on the branch.

**2. `src/codegen/index.ts`** — 🟡 **auto-merges, verify hook position**

Branch adds (unchanged from `587e811d6`):
- Line 14-17 (imports): `compileIrPathFunctions`, `planIrCompilation`
- Line 278-291: the IR-path hook block, immediately after the call
  `compileDeclarations(ctx, ast.sourceFile)`

Main adds (unrelated areas):
- Line ~215 (`collectExternDeclarations` neighborhood): a
  `checkWasiDomUsage(ctx, ast.sourceFile)` call for `--target wasi`
  mode (from issue #1045)
- Line ~1839: same `checkWasiDomUsage` call in the multi-source
  `generateModuleMulti` path
- Line ~3595: `__gen_yield_star` import declaration (yield* delegation,
  issue #1017)
- Line ~5403–5536: `DOM_ONLY_GLOBALS` constant + `checkWasiDomUsage`
  helper function

All main-side additions are in positions disjoint from the branch's IR
hook. Post-merge, verify:

- `compileDeclarations(ctx, ast.sourceFile)` is called exactly once
  before the `if (options?.experimentalIR) { … }` block in
  `generateModule`.
- The block's `compileIrPathFunctions(ctx, ast.sourceFile, selection)`
  still runs **after** `compileDeclarations` (the branch's whole point —
  symbolic refs see final funcIdx/typeIdx/globalIdx assignments; this
  is what makes `shiftLateImportIndices` a no-op for IR-path bodies).

**3. `src/compiler.ts`** — 🟡 **auto-merges, keep both additions**

Branch adds (one line, `278`):
```ts
        experimentalIR: options.experimentalIR,
```
inside the `createCodegenContext(...)` options literal.

Main adds a substantial block (commits `633ab4728`, `2a6affee2`):
- Import of `applyDefineSubstitutions` at top of file
- `isBindingPatternFalsePositive` helper (issue #862) — an enhancement
  that makes `isHardTypeScriptDiagnostic` take `checker?: ts.TypeChecker`
- `definedSource = options.define ? applyDefineSubstitutions(...) : source`
  at the top of `compileSource`, and a parallel block for
  `compileSourceMulti`
- Three call-site updates to `isHardTypeScriptDiagnostic(d, checker)`

The two patches touch different hunks. Post-merge, verify the
`createCodegenContext({…})` options literal still contains the
`experimentalIR: options.experimentalIR` line.

#### Files added by main (`added in remote`) — take unchanged

All straightforward additions, no branch-side counterpart:

- `src/compiler/define-substitution.ts` — **new** source file (issue
  #1043). Imported by `src/compiler.ts`.
- `tests/equivalence/issue-1025.test.ts` — param-default externref
  guard equivalence test.
- `tests/issue-1068.test.ts` — `await` as label identifier test.
- `tests/issue-1135.test.ts` — rest-destructuring of Wasm-constructed
  arrays test.
- `tests/issue-1156.test.ts` — new equivalence test.
- `tests/issue-973-repro.test.ts` — incremental state leak repro.

No interaction with IR code. Accept as-is.

#### Files modified on main that PR #231 did NOT touch

Take main's version verbatim for all:

- `src/runtime.ts` — adds `__throw_reference_error`, `__array_from_iter`,
  `__gen_yield_star` host imports. These integrate with main-added
  codegen paths (not IR paths). No branch-side conflict.
- `src/compiler/validation.ts` — `await` reserved-word logic rewritten
  (issue #1068). Clean merge; branch does not touch this file.
- `src/codegen/literals.ts` — `detectCountedPushLoopSize` helper added
  for issue #1001 preallocation. Clean merge.
- All other `src/codegen/**.ts` files modified only on main.

#### Planning artifacts — take main's version

Standard "take theirs" rule (per `feedback_check_before_cleanup.md` and
team-lead protocol for planning artifact merges):

- `.claude/ci-status/pr-*.json` (14 new, ~30 modified) — CI snapshot
  feeds. Always accept main's, they are append-only logs.
- `plan/agent-context/dev-*.md`, `plan/agent-context/senior-dev-*.md`
  (4 new) — agent session handoffs. Take main's.
- `plan/issues/backlog/1151.md`, `1154.md`, `1155.md`, `1157.md`,
  `1158.md`, `1159.md` (6 new) — new issues filed. Take main's.
- `plan/issues/done/1119.md`, `1127.md` — moved from `ready/` on main.
  Take main's (the `ready/` copies are correspondingly "removed in
  remote"; those removals stand).
- `plan/issues/ready/1119.md`, `1127.md`, `1135.md` — removed on main
  because they were moved to `done/` (1119, 1127) or to
  `sprints/43/1135.md` (1135). Accept the removals.
- `plan/issues/sprints/42/*.md` — 27 files removed on main (sprint 42
  consolidation, see commits `f3f3b0eda`, `c8bcaf8c1`). Accept the
  removals. Their content was either re-filed into
  `plan/issues/sprints/43/` or `plan/issues/done/`.
- `plan/issues/sprints/42/1150.md` (1 new) — sprint 42 late-addition.
  Take main's.
- `plan/issues/sprints/43/1025.md`, `1135.md`, `1147.md`, `1152.md`,
  `1153.md`, `1156.md` (6 new) — new sprint 43 issues. Take main's.
- `plan/issues/sprints/5/Bildschirmfoto 2026-04-21 um 05.12.05.png` —
  screenshot asset. Take main's.
- `benchmarks/**`, `dashboard/**`, `public/**` regenerated tables/reports
  from main. Per CLAUDE.md merge protocol: `git checkout --theirs`
  on the whole subtree, then run `npm run build:pages` if the dev
  wants a clean regeneration.

This issue file itself (`plan/issues/backlog/1131.md`) is **unchanged**
between branch base and both heads. This "Merge Resolution Plan" section
is the only modification and will be on the branch post-merge (the dev
doing the merge commits this as part of the conflict resolution, or the
architect pushes it directly to `feat/ir` before the dev picks up).

### Architectural risks

#### R1 — IR files live at `src/ir/`, not `src/ir-mid/` (§1.2 violation)

PR #231 placed every middle-end file
(`builder.ts`, `from-ast.ts`, `integration.ts`, `lower.ts`, `nodes.ts`,
`select.ts`, `verify.ts`) directly under `src/ir/`, alongside the
existing backend-IR file `src/ir/types.ts`. Issue #1131 §1.2 says
verbatim:

> "create a **new directory** `src/ir-mid/` and put everything under
> it. Do **not** repurpose `src/ir/` — it is the backend Wasm IR and
> stays where it is."

Consequence: `src/ir/index.ts` now barrel-exports both the backend-IR
types (from `./types`) and the middle-end nodes/builder/verifier. Any
code that does `import { … } from "../ir"` can no longer tell from
the import line which layer it's talking to. On a project that
explicitly tracks architectural separation (`#1124` exists because
the lack of separation is the problem we're solving!), this defeats
part of the point.

**Severity**: low-for-now, high-over-time. At Phase 1 there are few
enough call sites that a later rename is cheap. By Phase 3 (many
passes, many consumers) it will be a large sweep.

**Recommended action**: file a follow-up issue **#XXXX "rename
`src/ir/` → `src/ir-backend/` + create `src/ir-mid/`"** for immediate
execution after this merge lands. Mechanical change: one `git mv`,
one update of every `from "../ir"` import. Size: ~200 line touches
across ~40 files.

**Do NOT do it as part of this merge resolution** — the merge is
already fragile enough, and adding a rename layer would mix code
movement with conflict resolution.

#### R2 — IR hook only runs for single-source compiles, not multi-source

The branch's `compileIrPathFunctions` call is wired into
`generateModule` (the single-source path, `src/codegen/index.ts:278`)
but not into `generateModuleMulti` (multi-source path, around
`src/codegen/index.ts:1890` on main where `compileDeclarations(ctx, sf)`
is called in a loop over `multiAst.sourceFiles`).

Consequence: multi-file compiles (used by the WASI and test262 paths)
never route any function through the IR.

**Severity**: acceptable for Phase 1. The selector already defaults
off, and the stated Phase 1 acceptance criterion is "byte-identical
output when flag OFF" — which holds. Multi-source IR wiring is a
Phase 2 concern and should be filed as a dedicated issue when Phase 2
begins.

**Recommended action**: file **#XXXX "route IR through
`generateModuleMulti` as well"** for Phase 2. Not blocking this merge.

#### R3 — `reportError` vs `reportErrorNoNode` (main refactor)

Main changed `import { reportErrorNoNode } from "./context/errors.js";`
to `import { reportError, reportErrorNoNode } from "./context/errors.js";`
(for the new `checkWasiDomUsage` helper that needs node-attached errors).

Branch uses `reportErrorNoNode(ctx, ...)` for its IR error reporting
at the hook site. That call is **unchanged** post-merge — the branch's
line compiles against main's import statement because
`reportErrorNoNode` is still exported. No action needed; just verify
that the IR hook error path still compiles.

#### R4 — `FunctionContext` flow-fact fields not yet split (§2.4 deferral)

§2.4 of this issue specifies moving `narrowedNonNull`,
`safeIndexedArrays`, `tdzFlagLocals`, `boxedCaptures`,
`pendingCallbackWritebacks`, `persistentCallbackWritebacks`,
`catchRethrowStack`, `finallyStack` off `FunctionContext` as each
corresponding feature lands in the IR. PR #231 does not touch
`FunctionContext` at all (except for the 6-line `experimentalIR`
option on `CodegenOptions`). That is correct for Phase 1 — those
features are not yet IR-supported.

Post-merge check: `src/codegen/context/types.ts` should contain
exactly the branch's 6-line addition plus whatever main added
independently. Verify no accidental removal of flow-fact fields
happens.

### Recommended merge commit message

```
merge: sync origin/main into feat/ir — resolve CompileOptions conflict

Single real conflict: src/index.ts CompileOptions — keep both the
branch's experimentalIR?: boolean (#1131 Phase 1) and main's
define?: Record<string, string> (#1043) additions.

All other "changed in both" files (src/codegen/index.ts,
src/compiler.ts) auto-merge cleanly — the branch's IR hook lives in
hunks disjoint from main's #1045 WASI-DOM check, #1017 yield*
delegation, and #1043 define-substitution additions.

Planning artifacts (ci-status/, plan/, dashboard/, public/) taken
from main per CLAUDE.md merge protocol. Issue file moves
ready/→done/ and sprints/42/→sprints/43/ accepted.

Architectural follow-ups filed separately:
- IR files live at src/ir/, §1.2 says src/ir-mid/ — rename PR to
  follow
- generateModuleMulti does not yet route through IR — Phase 2 work

CHECKLIST-FOXTROT
```

### Post-merge verification checklist for the dev

1. **`src/index.ts`** contains both `experimentalIR?: boolean` and
   `define?: Record<string, string>` in `CompileOptions`.
2. **`src/codegen/index.ts`** line range covering `compileDeclarations`
   followed by `if (options?.experimentalIR)` is intact and the
   `compileIrPathFunctions` call compiles.
3. **`src/compiler.ts`** `createCodegenContext({…})` options literal
   still has `experimentalIR: options.experimentalIR` AND the new
   main-side `define`-related preprocessing runs BEFORE the
   codegen-context creation.
4. **`src/ir/{builder,from-ast,integration,lower,nodes,select,verify,index}.ts`**
   are present and unchanged vs `origin/feat/ir`.
5. **`tsc --noEmit`** passes.
6. **`npm test -- tests/ir-scaffold.test.ts tests/ir-numeric-bool-equivalence.test.ts tests/ir-let-const-equivalence.test.ts tests/ir-if-else-equivalence.test.ts tests/ir-ternary-equivalence.test.ts tests/linear-ir.test.ts`**
   passes — these are the PR's own gate.
7. **`npm test`** — full equivalence suite — passes with
   `experimentalIR` flag defaulting off (byte-identical output invariant).
8. Push branch, open PR, wait for CI. Merge only if:
   `net_per_test ≥ 0`, `regressions < 10`, no single bucket > 50.

### What to escalate to the tech lead

- If `tsc` fails post-merge (would indicate an import/type interaction
  we missed). Architect re-review on the specific failure.
- If any `ir-*.test.ts` test fails post-merge (would indicate the
  IR hook position shifted or a symbolic-ref resolver regression).
  Architect review.
- If `reportError` / `reportErrorNoNode` calls don't compile (name
  conflict between branch and main import lists). Mechanical fix; no
  architect review needed.
- If `experimentalIR: true` smoke test (compile a trivial
  `function f(x: number): number { return x + 1; }` with the flag
  on) does not produce a working module. Architect review — the IR
  hook is broken.

## Phase 2 Implementation Notes (2026-04-22)

Phase 2 landed as `feat/ir-phase2`. Files added / changed:

- **`src/ir/propagate.ts`** (NEW, ~350 lines) — `buildTypeMap`:
  context-insensitive forward propagation over the source file's call
  graph. Lattice `unknown → {f64, bool} → dynamic`. Seeds from explicit
  TS annotations + `checker.getSignatureFromDeclaration` /
  `checker.getTypeAtLocation` (covers JSDoc-typed `.js`). Worklist
  fixpoint (capped at 50 iters) re-evaluates each function's params
  (joining caller arg-expression inferences) and return type (joining
  inferred types of every `return <expr>` in the body, with a local
  scope that tracks `let`/`const` initializers).

  **Key design choice — optimistic `unknown` at operator sites.** For
  arithmetic `+ - * /`, an `unknown` operand is f64-compatible
  (result f64). For bool / logical ops, `unknown` is bool-compatible.
  This lets recursive kernels bootstrap: in iteration 1, `fib(n-1)`
  returns `unknown`, so `fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)` is `unknown + unknown`,
  which under the optimistic rule yields f64. The next iteration
  confirms f64 transitively, reaching fixpoint. Without optimism,
  the join would stay at `unknown` forever.

  **Seed authority.** When a function has an explicit TS annotation
  and body inference produces `dynamic` (because our inference can't
  see through some local structure), we keep the seed type. This
  preserves legacy annotated functions that our limited inference
  can't verify fully.

- **`src/ir/select.ts`** — extended to accept an optional `TypeMap`.
  A function is individually-claimable when all params + return
  resolve to concrete primitives via either explicit TS annotations
  OR TypeMap entries. `isPhase1Expr` now accepts `CallExpression`
  with an `Identifier` callee. After individual claims are built, a
  **call-graph closure** pass iteratively removes any claimed
  function whose any local caller OR local callee isn't also
  claimed. This is the critical correctness invariant: the IR path
  replaces a function's `typeIdx`, so if legacy-compiled callers
  already emitted `call` with the old signature, the module fails
  Wasm validation. Closure guarantees every cross-function edge is
  legacy↔legacy or IR↔IR.

  Also extended the statement shape to accept the early-return-if
  pattern `if (cond) return x; <rest>` (structurally equivalent to
  `if (cond) return x; else { <rest> }`). This is what `fib`'s body
  looks like in its classic form.

- **`src/ir/from-ast.ts`** — `lowerFunctionAstToIr` accepts
  `paramTypeOverrides` / `returnTypeOverride` (from TypeMap) and
  `calleeTypes` (map of callee name → IR signature). `lowerExpr`
  handles `CallExpression` by emitting `IrInstrCall` with the
  callee's propagated signature. Arg types are validated against
  the callee's expected param types; mismatch throws, forcing fall
  through to legacy (the selector should make this unreachable in
  practice).

  Also extended `lowerStatementList` to handle the early-return-if
  pattern — reserves two block IDs, emits a `br_if` to the
  then-arm (terminates in return) and an else-arm that
  recursively lowers the remaining statements.

- **`src/ir/integration.ts`** — `compileIrPathFunctions` accepts an
  `IrTypeOverrideMap` and threads per-function overrides + the
  shared `calleeTypes` view through to the lowerer.

- **`src/codegen/index.ts`** — before `planIrCompilation`, runs
  `buildTypeMap(ast.sourceFile, ast.checker)`. For each claimed
  function, resolves per-position types (AST annotation first,
  TypeMap fallback) into an IR type; functions where resolution
  fails are dropped from the selection so the function falls back
  to legacy with no error surfaced.

- **`src/compiler.ts`** — flipped `experimentalIR` default to on
  (`options.experimentalIR !== false`). The escape hatch
  `experimentalIR: false` still reaches the legacy path for
  divergence tests.

- **`tests/issue-1131.test.ts`** (NEW, 8 tests) — verifies fib with
  explicit annotations, fib with propagation-only inference, the
  default-on flag, the legacy escape hatch, and the benchmark
  source compiles without `__box_number` / `__unbox_number`.

- **`tests/ir-scaffold.test.ts`** — updated the selector expectation
  to include `withIfNoElse` (unlocked by the Phase-2 shape
  extension).

### Test results

- All 94 IR unit tests pass (Phase 1 + Phase 2).
- Full `tests/equivalence/` suite: identical fail/pass count on
  `feat/ir-phase2` vs `main` baseline — 106 failed / 1185 passed,
  no regressions from Phase 2.
- `tsc --noEmit` clean.

### What Phase 2 does NOT do

- No `generateModuleMulti` wiring (multi-source compiles still
  bypass IR entirely). Filed for Phase 3.
- No rewriting of already-emitted closures (that's Phase 3's
  `apply-inference` pass per #1131 §3).
- No monomorphization (#744), no tagged unions (#745).
- Context-insensitive only — call-site-specific refinement is
  Phase 3+.

### Benchmark check

Compiling `benchmarks/competitive/programs/fib-recursive.js`
(JSDoc-typed `run`, untyped `fib`) with default options produces
`$fib` with signature `(f64) → f64` sharing `run`'s type index.
Its body contains no references to `__box_number` /
`__unbox_number` — the recursive hot path is pure f64 arithmetic
and direct calls.

## Superseded (2026-06-12)

The middle-end IR this container proposed EXISTS (src/ir/, ~24k LoC: select/from-ast/verify/passes/backends) and its adoption program is tracked by plan/log/ir-adoption.md + the sprint-62 IR lane (#1922-#1926, #2134-#2138, #1804). Child phases #1167a/b/c are done. Closing the container; nothing actionable remains under this ID.
