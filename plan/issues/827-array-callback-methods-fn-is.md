# #827 -- Array callback methods: "fn is not a function" Wasm compile error (243 tests)

## Problem

243 tests fail with Wasm validation error "fn is not a function" at module instantiation. All are in `built-ins/Array/prototype/` and test callback-based array methods. The compiled Wasm module references a function that is missing or has the wrong type at instantiation time.

## Breakdown by method

| Method | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Array.prototype.every | 57 |
| Array.prototype.forEach | 45 |
| Array.prototype.filter | 40 |
| Array.prototype.reduce | 40 |
| Array.prototype.some | 35 |
| Array.prototype.map | 26 |

- test/built-ins/Array/prototype/map/15.4.4.19-5-1.js

## Root cause

In `src/codegen/expressions.ts`, the array callback method compilation (`setupArrayCallback` / `buildClosureCallInstrs`) generates a call to the callback function. When the test passes a non-function value (like `undefined`, `null`, a number, or a string) as the callback argument to test that a TypeError is thrown, the compiler:

1. Tries to resolve the callback as a function reference at compile time
2. When it can't find a valid function, emits a broken reference or missing import
3. The Wasm module fails validation with "fn is not a function"

These tests are specifically checking that `Array.prototype.every(nonFunction)` throws TypeError. The compiler needs to emit a runtime type check on the callback argument instead of assuming it's always a function.

## Suggested fix

1. In the array method compilation, emit a runtime check: `ref.test` the callback to see if it's callable
2. If not callable, throw a TypeError (emit the exception path)
3. Only proceed with the `call_ref` / `call_indirect` if the test passes
4. This may require the callback parameter to be typed as `externref` instead of `funcref`

## Acceptance criteria

- 243 "fn is not a function" compile errors resolved
- Array callback methods properly throw TypeError for non-function callbacks
- No regressions in existing Array method tests

## Implementation (dev-3, 2026-03-29)

### Changes

**src/codegen/array-methods.ts**
- Added `emitThrowString` helper (local copy to avoid circular dependency with index.ts)
- Added `isKnownNonCallable(ctx, node)` — detects statically non-callable types at compile time (null, undefined, number, string, boolean, object literals, void, never)
- Added `emitCallbackTypeCheck(ctx, fctx, callbackArg, methodName)` — emits TypeError throw when callback is missing or statically non-callable
- Applied to all 9 callback-accepting array methods: every, some, forEach, filter, map, reduce, reduceRight, find, findIndex
- Replaced previous `arguments.length < 1` + CE error pattern with proper TypeError emission

### Test results
- 0 CE across all array callback methods (down from 243)
- All basic array method usage (every, forEach, filter, map, reduce, some) still works correctly
- Non-function callbacks (null, missing args) correctly throw TypeError
