# #380 -- Unknown variable/function in test scope

## Status: open

25+ tests fail with "Unknown variable" or "Unknown function" errors for identifiers like `count`, `probe`, `probeParam`, `f`, `Symbol`, `Object`, `ERROR`, etc.

## Details

These errors fall into two categories:

1. **Harness variables**: test262 harness functions like `assert`, `assert.sameValue` should be in scope but some (like `$262`, `createRealm`) are not being injected
2. **Test-defined globals**: some tests define functions/variables in ways that the compiler doesn't pick up (e.g., via eval, or in a preamble that isn't being compiled)
3. **Built-in globals**: `Symbol`, `Object`, `Reflect` etc. should be recognized as known globals

Fixes may involve:
- Adding more built-in globals to the compiler's known-variable set
- Improving the test harness injection in test262-runner.ts
- Better scope analysis for test preambles

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Test harness variables are properly injected
- [ ] Built-in globals (Symbol, Object, Reflect) are recognized
- [ ] Test-defined global functions are discoverable
- [ ] 25+ previously failing compile errors are resolved
