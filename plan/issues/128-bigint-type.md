# Issue 128: BigInt type

## Summary

154 test262 tests use BigInt. Currently all skipped.

## Approach

BigInt maps naturally to wasm's `i64` type:
1. BigInt literals (`42n`) → i64.const
2. BigInt arithmetic → i64.add, i64.sub, etc.
3. BigInt comparison → i64.eq, i64.lt_s, etc.
4. Mixed BigInt/number operations → compile error (matches JS semantics)

## Complexity

M — New literal type + i64 codegen path + type checking.
