# #1011 — Offline-first benchmarks with Playwright DOM measurement and Run Live button

## Problem

1. Landing page benchmark charts (loadtime mode) re-measure on every page load — numbers are noisy and inconsistent
2. Runtime speed benchmarks exclude DOM examples because Node.js can't run DOM APIs
3. No way for visitors to compare their own hardware against the published numbers

## What to build

### A. Offline-first charts (default)
- All benchmark charts read from pre-generated JSON files (`playground-benchmark-sidebar.json`, `size-benchmarks.json`, `loadtime-benchmarks.json`)
- These files are generated locally on version tags (via `.husky/pre-push` hook on `refs/tags/v*`)
- No live measurement on page load — stable, reproducible numbers

### B. Playwright DOM benchmarks
- Add Playwright to `refresh:benchmarks` script
- Launch headless Chromium, navigate to each DOM benchmark
- Measure compile + instantiate + execute time in a real browser
- Include DOM examples (calendar, dom.ts) in `playground-benchmark-sidebar.json`
- Compare wasm DOM perf vs JS DOM perf

### C. "Run Live" button
- Add a button below each benchmark chart: "Run in your browser"
- On click: re-runs the benchmarks live in the visitor's browser
- Shows comparison: "Published (v0.1.0)" vs "Your browser"
- Uses the existing `<perf-benchmark-chart>` component with a live measurement mode

## Files to change
- `scripts/generate-playground-benchmark-sidebar.mjs` — add Playwright browser benchmarks
- `components/perf-benchmark-chart.js` — add "Run Live" button, split offline/live modes
- `index.html` — wire up the button
- `package.json` — add playwright dependency
- `.husky/pre-push` — already triggers on version tags

## Acceptance criteria
- Charts show stable offline numbers by default (no flicker between loads)
- DOM benchmarks included in the published data
- "Run Live" button works and shows comparison
