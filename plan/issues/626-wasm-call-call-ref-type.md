# #626 — Wasm call/call_ref type mismatch (378 CE)

## Status: in-review
378 tests fail with Wasm validation: call or call_ref arguments don't match the expected function signature. Arguments are the wrong type (externref vs f64, i32 vs ref).

### Fix
Ensure argument coercion before call instructions, especially for any-typed parameters calling typed functions.

## Complexity: M
