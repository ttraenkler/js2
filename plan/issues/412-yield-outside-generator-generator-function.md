# #412 -- Yield outside generator: generator function body not recognized

## Status: ready

166 tests fail with "yield expression outside of generator function". The compiler does not recognize the function body as a generator context in certain patterns.

## Root cause

When a generator function is defined via function expression, destructuring parameters, or nested inside another function, the generator flag (`isGenerator`) is not propagated to the compilation context. This causes `yield` expressions inside the body to be rejected.

Patterns that fail:
- Generator function expressions with destructuring parameters
- Generator methods in object/class literals
- Nested generator functions (generator inside generator)

## Example failures

- `test/language/expressions/function/dstr/ary-ptrn-elem-ary-elision-init.js` -- destructuring param in generator
- `test/language/expressions/function/dstr/dflt-ary-ptrn-elem-id-init-fn-name-gen.js`
- `test/language/expressions/generators/yield-as-label.js`

## Relationship to prior work

#287 (done) fixed generator compile errors for yield in loops/try. #267 (done) fixed yield outside generator for basic cases. This issue covers the remaining 166 cases where the generator context is lost in complex function expression patterns.

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Generator function expressions with destructuring params compile correctly
- [ ] Generator methods in object/class literals are recognized
- [ ] Nested generators propagate the isGenerator flag correctly
- [ ] CE count for "yield outside generator" reduced to <20
