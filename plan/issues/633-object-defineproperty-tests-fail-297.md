# #633 — Object.defineProperty tests fail (297 FAIL)

## Status: in-review
297 tests involving Object.defineProperty fail at runtime. Property descriptors (writable, enumerable, configurable, get/set) are not fully applied to struct-backed objects.

### Root cause
The test262 wrapper (`wrapTest`) wraps all test code in a `try { ... } catch { __fail = 1; }` block. The empty object shape inference (`inferEmptyObjectShapes`) did not recurse into try/catch blocks, so `var obj = {}; obj.foo = val;` patterns inside try blocks were not detected. This caused the variable to be compiled as externref instead of a struct, and `Object.defineProperty(obj, "prop", { value: v })` would go through the externref path using opaque Wasm GC references, which JS host functions cannot manipulate.

### Fix
Extended `scanStatements` and `collectPropsFromStatements` in `inferEmptyObjectShapes` to recurse into try/catch/finally blocks, for/while/do-while loops, and switch statement clauses. This enables shape inference to work correctly when test code is wrapped in try blocks.

## Complexity: M

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added try/catch/finally recursion to `scanStatements` in `collectEmptyObjectWidening` (index.ts) so that `var obj = {}` declarations inside try blocks are discovered
- Added try/catch/finally recursion to `collectPropsFromStatements` so that property assignments like `obj.foo = val` inside try blocks are found during shape inference
- Added for/while/do-while/switch recursion to `collectPropsFromStatements` for completeness
- Added 9 new equivalence tests covering defineProperty patterns inside try blocks

### What worked
- Shape inference now correctly handles the test262 pattern where `wrapTest` wraps code in try blocks
- `Object.defineProperty(obj, "foo", { value: val })` on struct-backed objects inside try blocks now works via the struct path
- Property reads after defineProperty return correct values

### What did not work / limitations
- Chained `Object.defineProperty(Object.defineProperty(obj, ...))` still causes opaque Wasm reference errors when the inner result is used as externref in the outer call
- Non-empty object literals typed as `any` (e.g., `const obj: any = { foo: 10 }`) are still not handled by shape inference
- Full descriptor semantics (writable, configurable, enumerable enforcement) are not implemented

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — `scanStatements` and `collectPropsFromStatements` try/catch/loop recursion
- `tests/equivalence/object-define-property-return.test.ts` — new test file with 9 tests

### Tests now passing
- All 28 defineProperty equivalence tests pass
- 4 new try-block-specific tests added and passing
