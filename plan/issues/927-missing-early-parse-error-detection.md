# #927 -- Missing early/parse error detection (840 FAIL)

## Problem

840 tests expect a parse or early error (SyntaxError, ReferenceError) but the compiler compiles and instantiates them successfully. The test harness reports: `expected parse/early error but compiled and instantiated successfully`.

These are **negative tests** in the test262 suite — they contain intentionally invalid JavaScript that must be rejected at parse/compile time. Our compiler accepts them.

## Error pattern

```
expected parse/early error but compiled and instantiated successfully
```

## Sample test files

- `test/language/expressions/arrow-function/static-init-await-reference.js` — `await` used as identifier in static init
- `test/language/expressions/async-arrow-function/await-as-identifier-reference-escaped.js` — escaped `await` as identifier
- Tests span: arrow functions, async functions, class elements, destructuring, labels, identifiers

## Categories of missing checks (estimated)

| Category | Est. count | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Reserved word violations | ~300 | `await`, `yield`, `eval`, `arguments` used as binding in strict/module context |
| Duplicate parameter names | ~150 | Non-simple params with duplicates |
| Invalid destructuring targets | ~100 | Assignment to non-assignable patterns |
| Class element restrictions | ~100 | Static init blocks with `await`/`yield`/`arguments` |
| Label violations | ~50 | Duplicate labels, break/continue to non-existent labels |
| Other | ~140 | Various early error conditions |

## Root cause

The TypeScript parser is lenient — it often accepts syntax that is invalid JavaScript (e.g., `await` as identifier in async context). The compiler needs an additional validation pass that checks JS-specific early error conditions from the ECMAScript specification (sections 12-15 "Static Semantics: Early Errors").

## Relationship to existing issues

- #831 covers a subset (242 FAIL for `expected SyntaxError`)
- #845 covers some miscellaneous CE patterns
- This issue is the comprehensive umbrella for ALL missing early error checks

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] >=600 of 840 "expected parse/early error" tests now correctly reject at compile time
- [ ] No regression in existing PASS tests
- [ ] Implementation adds a static-semantics validation pass (not ad-hoc checks scattered through codegen)

## Implementation notes

Consider adding a `validateEarlyErrors(sourceFile: ts.SourceFile)` pass in `src/compiler.ts` that runs after TypeScript parsing but before codegen. This centralizes all early error checks and keeps codegen clean.
