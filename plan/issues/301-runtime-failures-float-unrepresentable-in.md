# Issue #301: Runtime failures -- float unrepresentable in integer range

## Status: done

## Summary
4 tests fail with "RuntimeError: float unrepresentable in integer range". Infinity, -Infinity, or very large float values are being converted to integer types (i32/i64) using trunc instructions that trap on out-of-range values. These need saturating conversion instructions instead.

## Category
Sprint 5 / Group B

## Complexity: S

## Scope
- Replace `i32.trunc_f64_s` with `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` for potentially out-of-range values
- Replace `i64.trunc_f64_s` with `i64.trunc_sat_f64_s` similarly
- Add NaN/Infinity guards before integer conversions
- Update numeric coercion in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Infinity/NaN conversions to integer use saturating truncation
- All 4 float unrepresentable failures resolved

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Replaced all trapping float-to-int truncation instructions with their saturating (non-trapping) equivalents throughout the codebase:
- `i32.trunc_f64_s` -> `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` (39 occurrences in expressions.ts, 1 in index.ts)
- `i64.trunc_f64_s` -> `i64.trunc_sat_f64_s` (2 occurrences in expressions.ts)

Added `i64.trunc_sat_f64_s` to the IR type system and both binary emitters (it was missing -- only the i32 sat variants were previously defined).

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- replaced all 41 trapping trunc instructions with sat variants
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- replaced 1 trapping trunc instruction with sat variant
- `src/ir/types.ts` -- added `i64.trunc_sat_f64_s` to Instr union
- `src/emit/opcodes.ts` -- added `i64_trunc_sat_f64_s` and `i64_trunc_sat_f64_u` opcodes
- `src/emit/binary.ts` -- added emitter case for `i64.trunc_sat_f64_s`
- `src/emit/object.ts` -- added emitter case for `i64.trunc_sat_f64_s`

### What worked
The saturating trunc instructions are part of the WebAssembly nontrapping float-to-int conversions proposal, which is universally supported. The i32 sat variants were already in the IR/emitter infrastructure; only i64 sat needed to be added.

### Tests
- All compiler tests pass (pre-existing closure test failure unrelated)
- All 26 equivalence tests pass
