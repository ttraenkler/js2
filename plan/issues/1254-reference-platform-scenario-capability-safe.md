# #1254 -- Reference platform scenario: capability-safe DOM wrapper with explicit subtree authority

## Problem

The current `js²` platform story says that JavaScript modules should move away from
ambient authority and toward explicit host capabilities, but there is no concrete
reference implementation that makes this legible in a browser setting.

That leaves an important gap in the product story:

- we say Wasm modules should receive explicit capabilities instead of inheriting the
  ambient browser environment
- we say this can reduce attack surface and make modular composition safer
- but we do not yet show what that looks like for realistic DOM interaction

We need a browser-hosted reference scenario in which a compiled `js²` module runs inside
a constrained module sandbox, receives only explicit DOM capabilities as imports, and is
restricted to a passed-in subtree root element that cannot be escaped by supported
operations.

## Scenario

Build a capability-safe wrapper for browser execution with these constraints:

- the module has no ambient access to `window`, `document`, or equivalent globals
- the host passes in required DOM operations as explicit imports
- the host passes in one subtree root element as the module's full DOM authority boundary
- all supported DOM access stays confined to that subtree
- no supported operation allows the module to escape to the outer document tree

This should be presented as a reference platform path, not as a toy demo.

## Why this matters

This scenario makes several strategic claims concrete:

- `js²` can support a **capability-oriented host model**
- browser-hosted JavaScript can become **less ambient and more explicit**
- DOM integration can be expressed as a **bounded platform interface**
- smaller compiled modules become easier to reason about when they do not automatically
  inherit the full browser environment

It is also the clearest public example for the security side of the `js²` story.

## Scope

- define the module-sandbox execution model for the browser scenario
- remove ambient browser authority from the module surface
- expose necessary DOM functionality through explicit imports only
- pass a subtree root capability into the module
- define and document the supported DOM operations
- ensure the subtree root cannot be escaped through those supported operations
- provide one useful end-to-end demo that manipulates DOM inside the allowed subtree

## Non-goals

- no claim that this replaces all iframe, worker, or process isolation models
- no requirement to harden every possible browser API in this issue
- no requirement to solve arbitrary third-party DOM library compatibility
- no requirement to provide a universal browser sandbox for all JS code

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A `js²` browser module can be loaded without ambient access to `window` or `document`
- [ ] DOM functionality is passed as explicit host imports
- [ ] The module receives a subtree root capability that defines its DOM authority
- [ ] Supported DOM operations remain confined to that subtree root
- [ ] No supported operation permits escape to parent or sibling DOM outside the subtree
- [ ] The scenario is documented as a reference host pattern, including trust boundary and
      capability model
- [ ] A public demo or reproducible example shows useful DOM interaction inside the bounded
      subtree
