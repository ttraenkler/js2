# #3525 — IR-only R5: whole-program single- and multi-source Prepared ownership

## Objective

Make single-source and `compileMultiSource` use the same whole-program
preparation owner. Exactly one `ProgramAbiMap`, `PreparedIrProgram`, unit
ledger, module-binding graph, and ordered module-init plan are built across all
input sources before either direct or IR body emission begins.

R5 removes the M0 model in which every source is planned independently after
all direct bodies already exist. Cross-file imports, exports, re-exports,
default/namespace imports, global-script declarations, same-name declarations,
classes, closures, and module initialization must resolve by R1 structural
identity. Fast and ordinary multi-source modes may differ in representation,
but not in front-end ownership or source-unit accounting.

## Current evidence

The current multi-source route is a post-legacy, per-source patch loop:

- `src/compiler.ts:1489-1620` builds one `MultiTypedAST`, but
  `src/compiler.ts:1014-1017` deliberately omits IR-first skip evidence for
  multi-source because M0 still compiles twice.
- `src/index.ts:676-755` exposes three public entry routes (`compileMulti`,
  `compileFiles`, and `compileProject`) that converge on multi-source compiler
  entries. `src/checker/index.ts:1058-1232` owns dependency-first graph/order;
  that order must become explicit Prepared-program input rather than be
  rediscovered by codegen.
- `src/codegen/index.ts:5072-5314` creates one legacy `CodegenContext`, then
  compiles declarations and direct bodies for every source at `:5249-5252`.
  The comment at `:5257-5268` says all direct bodies already exist and disables
  fast-mode overlay because its ABI differs.
- Only afterward, `src/codegen/index.ts:5269-5314` loops source-by-source,
  calls `planIrOverlay(..., { resolveModuleBindings: false })`, applies a local
  safe selection, prepares that source, and patches its slots. There is no
  program-owned preparation transaction.
- `collectMultiIrFunctionNameCollisions` at `src/codegen/index.ts:2301-2318`
  treats a flat function spelling as identity. `collectMultiImportAliasNames`
  (`:2320-2343`), `collectMultiImportedFunctionNames` (`:2346-2390`), and
  `collectMultiCrossFileFunctionNames` (`:2402-2464`) conservatively suppress
  aliases, default/namespace imports, checker edges, and global-script names.
- `makeMultiIrSafeSelection` at `src/codegen/index.ts:2569-2621` drops blocked
  weak components through flat `ctx.funcMap` keys and explicitly clears class
  members and module init. Nested runtime declarations, generic aliases,
  callable boundaries, and occupied synthetic names are rejection gates rather
  than modeled program edges.
- `src/ir/imported-functions.ts:61-223` can follow checker symbols across the
  realm, but only admits a unique declaration and unique flat canonical name.
  Valid same-name functions therefore become ambiguous before R1 identities
  can disambiguate them.
- `src/ir/integration.ts:3100-3119` documents that the synthesized closure
  registry restarts on every source in M0, forcing generated-name collision
  avoidance instead of one program-owned synthetic-unit registry.
- `src/codegen/index.ts:4988-5065` copies default/named aliases between flat
  maps and treats namespace imports as an explicit no-op. Re-exports with a
  module specifier are skipped by `src/codegen/declarations.ts:930-955`.
- Every multi-source `compileDeclarations` call rebuilds the progressively
  larger accumulated module-init state (`src/codegen/declarations.ts:2150-2229`
  and `:2351-2360`) and appends another `__module_init` (`:2366-2441`); only the
  newest export replaces the older one. One runtime invocation therefore does
  not prove one serialized semantic body.

The multi tests prove useful behavior but not ownership. In particular,
`tests/issue-2138-multi-module-ir-overlay.test.ts` proves an overlay can patch a
bounded population after direct compilation; it does not prove one program was
prepared before emission.

## Whole-program contract

`prepareIrProgram` (or the repository-equivalent entry point) accepts the
ordered source set and entry source exactly once. It must produce:

1. One R1 `ProgramAbiMap` containing every source/import/export/global/class/
   callable/synthetic binding, with explicit alias edges and stable structural
   IDs. Semantic evaluation order is recorded separately from canonical ID/map
   order.
2. One R2 `PreparedIrProgram` whose components may cross file boundaries and
   whose terminal outcomes cover the complete R0 census.
3. One R4 ordered module graph/init plan. Each source's instantiation and
   evaluation entries remain identifiable, while exactly one semantic init
   body is serialized and startup invokes it exactly once in dependency order,
   stable within-SCC order, and caller order for disconnected roots.
4. One program-owned closure, helper, literal, type, and runtime-intent
   registry. No per-source reset, generated-name probe, or late merge is
   permitted after preparation freezes.
5. A source-qualified export surface. Default, named, namespace, renamed, and
   re-export aliases resolve to canonical binding IDs; public names remain the
   requested module interface, not internal identity.

Single-source compilation must call this same entry with a one-element source
set. Maintaining a separate single-source semantic planner would leave two
front-ends and make R8 backend convergence unprovable.

## Ownership and resolution invariants

- Build the whole source census, module graph, ABI, signatures, classes,
  globals, module-init entries, and support intents before any source body is
  emitted. No source may become prepared because an earlier source's legacy
  emitter populated a map.
- Keep canonical structural identity/order distinct from observable module
  evaluation ordinals. Reordering internal maps or side-effect-free disconnected
  units may not perturb IDs; side-effectful disconnected roots retain caller
  order, while cycles use explicit stable SCC/TDZ order.
- Resolve imports and re-exports through checker identity plus `IrBindingId`,
  never by copying entries between `funcMap`, `closureMap`, or
  `moduleGlobals`. Namespace access is a typed module binding, not a string
  alias scan.
- Two files may declare the same display name, two script files may contribute
  globals, and a local declaration may resemble a synthetic helper name. They
  remain distinct unless the language binding graph intentionally aliases
  them.
- Component preparation is whole-program. A cross-file call/signature failure
  yields one typed pre-emission `Unsupported` component under hybrid policy or
  an `Invariant`; it cannot leave half the component patched and half direct.
- Every source body has exactly one terminal outcome and one emitter. Prepared
  units record `directBodyEmissions=0, irBodyEmissions=1`; temporary hybrid
  Unsupported units record `1,0`. Fast mode obeys the same ledger.
- A post-freeze missing binding, slot, helper, import, type, module-init entry,
  or backend adapter is an `Invariant`. It never restarts preparation for one
  source or demotes a previously emitted unit.

## Bounded landing sequence

### M0 — parity census and one program container

- Introduce the ordered source/module graph and build a single
  `ProgramAbiMap`/`PreparedIrProgram` beside current output without changing
  routing.
- Reconcile per-source and whole-program counts, identities, aliases, ordered
  module-init entries, and support registries. Add test seams for omission,
  duplicate ownership, source-order reversal, and ambiguous display names.

### M1 — cross-file free-function and binding ownership

- Prepare call components across source boundaries and resolve named/default/
  renamed/namespace imports and re-exports through canonical binding IDs.
- Feed ordinary and fast multi-source lowering from the same frozen program.
  Temporary Unsupported components direct-emit once only after preparation.
- Remove the cross-file/import/name collision suppressors only when the census
  proves those exact units are Prepared or typed Unsupported and emitted once.

### M2 — classes, closures, globals, and ordered module init

- Extend R3/R4 ownership across files, including inheritance, closures,
  reassigned function/global live bindings, global scripts, static effects, and
  entry/dependency initialization order.
- Consolidate program-wide synthetic/helper/type registries and startup wiring.
- Replace the progressively rebuilt per-source `__module_init` functions with
  one program-owned planned/emitted init body, not merely one surviving export.
- Remove the per-source overlay loop and M0 `resolveModuleBindings: false`
  escape only after zero direct emissions are recorded for every Prepared
  multi-source body.

## File ownership and locks

One implementing agent owns `src/index.ts`, `src/checker/index.ts`,
`src/codegen/index.ts`, `src/codegen/declarations.ts`, `src/compiler.ts`,
`src/ir/integration.ts`, `src/ir/imported-functions.ts`,
`src/ir/module-bindings.ts`, and the R1–R4 program, ABI, preparation, and
module-init modules for the landing. These files encode one whole-program
transaction and may not be split among parallel writers.

Coordinate with #3527 before changing cross-file async call/delegation ABI and
with #3528 before exposing backend consumers. Runtime-family provider changes
belong to #3526. Do not edit direct handler implementations merely to widen
M0; R5 changes ownership and resolution.

## Anti-vacuity tests

`tests/issue-3525-ir-whole-program-multi-source.test.ts` must prove:

1. The same fixture compiled through single-source and one-file multi-source
   creates the same serialized program/ABI identities and emitter counts.
2. Two files export same-named functions/classes/globals; renamed, default,
   namespace, `export *`, and chained `export { default as x } from` aliases
   call the correct declaration without collision suppression or last-wins.
3. Forward and cyclic cross-file calls prepare as one component. Reordering
   internal maps or side-effect-free disconnected units preserves canonical
   IDs/provider order; dependency, stable SCC, TDZ, and caller-root evaluation
   order remain explicit. An injected signature error terminates the whole
   component before body emission.
4. Global-script declarations, reassigned function bindings, and imports that
   share display names remain distinct/live. Export aliases observe the same
   canonical storage after reassignment.
5. Cross-file inheritance, static effects, closures, and module initializers
   serialize one init body and execute once in semantic order across host,
   deferred host, standalone, and WASI-relevant configurations.
6. Fast and ordinary multi-source modes consume the same Prepared unit set and
   `ProgramAbiMap`; each Prepared source body records direct=0/IR=1.
7. Poisoning the old per-source `planIrOverlay`, collision collectors, or
   `compileDeclarations` body route does not affect a fully Prepared fixture;
   restoring any route fails the zero-direct/reachability gate.
8. Missing alias, duplicate slot, late helper/import/type request, unaccounted
   source, or second module-init invocation raises the stable R0 Invariant.
9. `compileMulti`, `compileFiles`, `compileProject`, and the internal record
   route all produce the same canonical program for equivalent inputs.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Single- and multi-source compilation invoke one whole-program preparation
      entry and consume the same `PreparedIrProgram` schema.
- [ ] Exactly one `ProgramAbiMap`, terminal-outcome ledger, ordered module-init
      plan, and support registry cover all sources before body emission.
- [ ] Named/default/namespace/renamed imports, exports/re-exports, global
      scripts, same-name declarations, cross-file calls/classes/closures, and
      live bindings resolve by structural identity.
- [ ] Ordinary and fast multi-source modes emit every Prepared source body once
      through IR and no direct body; typed hybrid Unsupported bodies emit direct
      once only after the whole-program ownership decision.
- [ ] The per-source M0 overlay loop, `resolveModuleBindings: false`, flat-name
      collision/import suppressors, and per-source synthetic registry are
      absent after their reachability/ledger proofs pass.
- [ ] Module initialization and startup preserve dependency/source order and
      exactly-once behavior across host, deferred host, standalone, and WASI.
- [ ] The R0 IR-only gate includes multi-source denominators, compile errors,
      fatal result errors, late support requests, and direct/IR emitter counts;
      no compile failure is caught or skipped.
- [ ] Multi-file/equivalence/cross-backend/fast/standalone/WASI suites,
      typecheck, format, validity, and merge-group Test262 are net-non-negative.

## Deletion boundary

R5 deletes only the multi-source planning/overlay/collision gates made
unreachable by the whole-program owner. It retains direct body implementations
for typed hybrid Unsupported units until R9 and does not delete runtime
providers. General AST→Wasm handler deletion remains #3090/R10 after R9.

## Out of scope

- Changing package/module resolution policy or adding a new loader.
- Treating global-script merging as permission for accidental flat-name
  collisions.
- Implementing async semantics (#3527), runtime-family contracts (#3526), or a
  separate linear multi-source front-end (#3528).
- Keeping a second one-file semantic planner for convenience.

## Risks and mitigations

- **Evaluation-order drift:** merging source plans can reorder side effects.
  Preserve dependency, within-SCC, TDZ, and disconnected-root caller ordinals
  separately from canonical structural ordering, and compare event traces.
- **Alias/cycle ambiguity:** name copying can appear correct on acyclic named
  imports. Resolve canonical binding IDs and test default/namespace/re-export
  cycles with same-name declarations.
- **Fast ABI divergence:** fast mode can tempt a second preparation path. Keep
  representation conversion below the shared Prepared boundary.
- **Late registry mutation:** program-wide helpers can shift indices after an
  earlier source emitted. Freeze all intents first and make every late request
  fatal.
- **False zero:** deleting collision suppressors can lower the counted
  denominator. Reconcile source census, outcomes, and emitter counts by
  `IrUnitId` before and after every deletion.
