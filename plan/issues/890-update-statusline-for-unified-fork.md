# #890 — Update statusline for unified fork test262 runner

## Status: open

The statusline script (`.claude/statusline-command.sh`) was written for the old two-phase runner and only checks `/workspace/benchmarks/results/` for JSONL data. The unified fork runner (#889) writes results to worktrees or `/tmp` worktrees.

### Changes needed

1. Search multiple paths for the active JSONL (worktrees, `/tmp/js2wasm-vitest-*`, main workspace)
2. Remove `precompile-tests` process detection (no longer used)
3. Include fork worker processes (`test262-worker`, `compiler-bundle`) in RSS total
4. Vitest process grep should match any vitest, not just `vitest.*test262`
