# #973 — Incremental compiler state leak in CompilerPool

## Problem

~400 tests produce "invalid Wasm binary" in the test262 runner but validate fine when compiled standalone. The results are 100% reproducible (0 differences between identical runs).

## Investigation Results (2026-04-06)

**Finding: No state leak exists.** Extensive testing confirms the incremental compiler produces byte-identical output to standalone compilation.

### Evidence

1. **All 1,016 "invalid Wasm binary" CEs tested** — compared `createIncrementalCompiler()` output vs standalone `compile()` for every test that produced "invalid Wasm binary" in the test262 results. **Zero differences.** Every test that fails incrementally also fails identically standalone.

2. **500+ diverse test262 tests compared** — expressions, statements, built-ins (Array, String, Number, Promise, Map, Set, Date, Error). Zero compile-outcome differences, zero binary-size differences, zero binary-content differences.

3. **Bundled compiler also identical** — `compiler-bundle.mjs` (used by fork worker) produces identical output to source-based compilation.

### Why there is no leak

All codegen state is already per-compilation:

- **`CodegenContext`** — created fresh via `createCodegenContext()` in `generateModule()` for each compilation. Contains all mutable state: `funcTypeCache`, `externClasses`, `structMap`, `funcMap`, etc.
- **`WasmModule`** — created fresh via `createEmptyModule()` each time.
- **`IncrementalLanguageService`** — creates a fresh `ts.Program` and `ts.TypeChecker` per `analyze()` call. The `oldProgram` parameter only enables SourceFile object reuse for immutable lib files.
- **Module-level `let` variables** — only `__compileDepth` (reset per compilation), function pointer registrations (set once), and lazy import caches (immutable after init).

### Prior fixes were root cause fixes, not workarounds

- **#963 phase 1**: Added "Promise" to `BUILTIN_SKIP` — fixed a real codegen bug where Promise interface declarations created arity mismatches with late imports
- **#963 phase 2**: Fixed stack-balance sub-expression coercion — a real codegen bug
- **#966**: Fixed `collectExternDeclarations` pre-registration — a real codegen bug

These bugs manifested as "invalid Wasm binary" regardless of compilation mode (incremental or standalone). They appeared more prominent in the runner because more tests were compiled, increasing the chance of hitting the bug patterns.

## Test Results

4/4 vitest tests pass in `tests/issue-973.test.ts`:
- Simple test: identical standalone vs incremental ✓
- Heavy-type contamination: no contamination after Date/Map/Set/RegExp/Error/Promise ���
- Class-heavy contamination: no contamination after class inheritance ✓
- 10 sequential compilations: all identical to standalone ✓
