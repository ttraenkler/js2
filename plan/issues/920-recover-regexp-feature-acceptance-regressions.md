# #920 -- Recover RegExp feature acceptance regressions relative to the April 1 test262 baseline

## Problem

The largest compile-side regression cluster since the April 1 baseline is in `built-ins/RegExp`.

Observed transition counts:

- `66` cases: `fail -> compile_error`
- `24` cases: `pass -> compile_error`

Representative failures:

- `test/built-ins/RegExp/named-groups/duplicate-names-split.js`
- `test/built-ins/RegExp/named-groups/duplicate-names-replaceall.js`
- `test/built-ins/RegExp/regexp-modifiers/syntax/valid/remove-modifiers-when-nested.js`
- `test/built-ins/RegExp/property-escapes/generated/Script_-_Beria_Erfe.js`

Representative current compile error:

```text
Invalid regular expression: /(?<x>a)|(?<x>b)/
```

This suggests the project is now rejecting some RegExp syntax/features that were previously accepted far enough to execute.

## Goal

Restore the earlier acceptance behavior for the affected RegExp feature set, or narrow the regression to a smaller justified unsupported subset.

## Requirements

1. Identify which validation/parsing stage now rejects the affected RegExp forms
2. Group the failures by feature family:
   - duplicate named groups
   - regexp modifiers
   - property escapes
3. Fix the acceptance path for the representative pass->compile_error cases
4. Add focused regression coverage for a small representative subset
5. Re-run targeted test262 coverage and confirm the compile_error regression count drops

## Acceptance criteria

- representative previously passing RegExp tests no longer fail at compile time
- the `built-ins/RegExp` regression cluster is materially reduced relative to the April 1 baseline
- the issue text or final change explains exactly which constructs were restored

## Investigation Findings

The issue description's "Invalid regular expression" hypothesis was incorrect. Node v25.8.2
supports all three mentioned features (duplicate named groups, regexp modifiers, property escapes)
and the regex validation in `compiler.ts:1032-1044` accepts them fine. Those specific test categories
show 0 compile_errors in the current results.

The actual 48 RegExp compile_error regressions (vs March 31 baseline: 6 → 54) break down as:

### "Missing import" errors (37 regressions) — FIXED
Methods like `hasOwnProperty()`, `toString()`, `isPrototypeOf()`, and array methods called on
RegExp objects were intercepted by `compileExternMethodCall` (because RegExp is an extern class),
which tried to find `RegExp_hasOwnProperty` etc. imports that don't exist, instead of falling
through to generic Object/prototype handlers.

**Root cause**: `isExternalDeclaredClass` check at `expressions.ts:10582` ran before generic
method handlers, and `compileExternMethodCall` errored fatally instead of returning undefined
for unregistered methods.

**Fix**: Two changes in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`:
1. Move `hasOwnProperty`/`propertyIsEnumerable` check before extern class dispatch
2. Make `compileExternMethodCall` return `undefined` (not error) when method has no registered
   import in the extern class hierarchy, allowing fallthrough to generic handlers like `toString`,
   `isPrototypeOf`, string methods, etc.

### Wasm type mismatches (11 regressions) — NOT FIXED (separate bugs)
- 6 tests: `local.tee expected (ref null 1), found struct.new` — closure capture type mismatch
  in `annexB/legacy-accessors` tests (5 were pass→CE)
- 4 tests: `array.get expected (ref null 0), found extern.convert_any` — native array.get on
  externref RegExp exec results
- 1 test: `struct.new[1] expected eqref, found extern.convert_any`

These are deeper codegen issues in closure compilation and externref-to-native type coercion.

## Test Results

- Equivalence tests: 130 passed, 29 failed (identical to main — zero regressions)
- RegExp equivalence: 16/16 pass
- Fix eliminates 37/48 RegExp compile_error regressions (3 pass→CE restored, 34 fail→CE restored)
