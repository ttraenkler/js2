# #403 — import.source meta-property errors (86 CE)

## Status: open

86 tests fail with "'source' is not a valid meta-property for keyword 'import'". These tests use import source assertions, a Stage 3 TC39 proposal.

## Details

The TypeScript parser does not recognize `import.source` as a valid meta-property (it only knows `import.meta`). These tests exercise the "Import Source" proposal for module source phase imports.

Options:
1. Skip these tests in the test runner (they test a Stage 3 feature we do not need to support)
2. Add a parser pre-pass that strips or transforms `import.source` references
3. Upgrade the TypeScript version to one that supports this syntax

Given the low priority and the fact that this is a Stage 3 proposal, skipping is the most pragmatic approach.

## Complexity: XS

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] 86 import.source CE tests are either skipped or handled gracefully
