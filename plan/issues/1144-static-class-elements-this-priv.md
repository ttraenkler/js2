## Problem

Private field access (`this.#priv`) inside static class methods resolved the receiver incorrectly, causing Wasm null traps or wrong values. Static methods receive the class constructor as `this`, not an instance — the codegen path did not account for this.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `this.#priv` inside a static method resolves correctly via the class object
- [x] test262 static private field access tests pass

## Implementation

Merged via PR #204 (branch `issue-class-elements-static`). Follow-up static private getter fix also in PR #158.
