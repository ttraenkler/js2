# #873 -- Design and land the ff-only integrated-branch merge protocol

## Outcome

This issue is complete. The original "shared dev branch" proposal was not the
final answer; the repo converged on the stricter integrated-branch + `ff-only`
protocol that is now documented and enforced.

Current landed pieces:

- developer workflow guidance in [developer.md](../../../.claude/agents/developer.md)
- `ff-only` merge checklist in [pre-merge-checklist.md](../../pre-merge-checklist.md)
- integrated-branch test-and-merge flow in [test-and-merge.sh](../../../scripts/test-and-merge.sh)
- enforcement hook in [pre-merge.sh](../../../.claude/hooks/pre-merge.sh)
- retrospective validation in [sprint-30.md](../../sprints/sprint-30.md) and [sprint-30 retrospective](../../retrospectives/sprint-30.md)

## Final protocol

1. Developers integrate `main` into their working branch before signaling completion.
2. Tests run on the integrated branch, not on `main`.
3. Merges to `main` happen via `git merge --ff-only`.
4. The merge hook blocks unproven merges to `main`.
5. "Completed" now means "merged to main", not merely "code done".

## Notes

- The originally proposed shared `dev` branch was superseded.
- The repo now uses the stricter integrated-branch + proof-gated `ff-only`
  approach instead.
