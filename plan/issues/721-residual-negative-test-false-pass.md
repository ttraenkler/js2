# Issue #721: Residual negative test false-pass

2,564 tests with `negative: { phase: parse }` still compile when they should fail. #703 added some checks but many patterns remain.

## Checks Added to `detectEarlyErrors()`

1. **`with` statement** — `with` is a SyntaxError in strict mode (all modules are strict). ~500 tests.
2. **Legacy octal literals** — `077` pattern is illegal in strict mode; `0o77` is fine. ~200 tests.
3. **`delete` of unqualified identifier** — `delete x` is a SyntaxError in strict mode. ~200 tests.
4. **`for-in` with initializer** — `for (var x = 0 in obj)` is a SyntaxError in strict mode.
5. **Labeled function declarations** — `label: function f() {}` is a SyntaxError in strict mode.
6. **Duplicate parameter names** — already existed from #703, verified working.
7. **Assignment to eval/arguments** — already existed from #703, verified working.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added 5 new early error checks to the `detectEarlyErrors()` function in `src/compiler.ts`:
- `with` statement detection in strict mode
- Legacy octal literal detection (`0[0-7]+` pattern, not `0o`/`0O` prefix)
- `delete` of unqualified identifier in strict mode
- `for-in` loop with initializer in strict mode
- Labeled function declarations in strict mode

### What worked
All checks correctly detect their target patterns while avoiding false positives on valid code:
- `0o77` (modern octal) passes fine
- `delete obj.prop` (property access) passes fine
- `for (var x in obj)` (no initializer) passes fine
- Normal functions with distinct params pass fine

### Files changed
- `src/compiler.ts` — added checks to `visit()` function inside `detectEarlyErrors()`

### Tests
All existing equivalence tests pass. Manual verification of all 5 new checks plus no-regression tests on valid code.
