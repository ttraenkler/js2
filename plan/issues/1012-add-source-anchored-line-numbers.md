# #1012 — Add source-anchored line numbers to all runtime error patterns

## Problem

The test262 report shows thousands of FAIL results with no source location info. The top error patterns are:

| Count | Error pattern |
|-------|--------------|
| 1,616 | `p.then is not a function` |
| 643 | `object is not a function` |
| 311 | `then is not a function` |
| 286 | `returned 2 — assert #* (found 0 asserts in source)` |
| 263 | `expected parse/early error but compiled and instantiated successfully` |
| 229 | `dereferencing a null pointer [in test()]` |
| 165 | `illegal cast [in test()]` |

These errors carry no source line numbers (e.g. `Lx:y` prefix), making it impossible to trace them back to the original JS source without manual investigation.

Sprint 39's #985 and #989 added source-anchored diagnostics to **compile errors** (invalid Wasm binary, compiler catch paths), but **runtime errors** from the test harness still lack them.

## Investigation needed (architect)

For each error pattern, determine:

1. **Where the error originates** — is it a Wasm trap (null deref, illegal cast), a JS host import error (p.then, object is not a function), or a test harness error (assert, early error)?

2. **Why no line number** — does the compiled Wasm have source maps? Does the test runner capture the stack trace? Does the error propagate through host imports that lose the stack?

3. **How to add line numbers** — for each pattern:
   - Wasm traps: can source maps + V8's `--experimental-wasm-stack-switching` help?
   - Host import errors: can the runtime wrapper capture and annotate the source location?
   - Test harness errors: can the runner extract the stack trace from the exception?

4. **Priority order** — which patterns are cheapest to fix vs highest impact?

## Expected output

An implementation plan in this issue file with:
- Root cause per error pattern
- Proposed fix per pattern (runtime change, harness change, or compiler change)
- Estimated effort per pattern
- Recommended implementation order

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture overview

Source maps **are already generated** — the test262 worker compiles with `sourceMap: true` (test262-worker.mjs:25) and the result includes `result.sourceMap`. Two helper functions already exist in the worker:

- `extractWasmByteOffset(err)` — parses `:0x<hex>` or `@+<dec>` from V8 stack traces (line 61)
- `lookupSourceMapOffset(sourceMapJson, wasmOffset)` — decodes VLQ mappings to get `{line, column, source}` (line 94)

These are used for **compile errors** (`buildInvalidBinaryError`, line 140) but **never for runtime errors** (the catch block at line 350). This is the single root cause for 5 of the 7 error patterns — the plumbing exists but isn't wired up for execution failures.

### Root cause per error pattern

#### Pattern 1: `p.then is not a function` (1,616 hits)
- **Origin**: Host import `Promise_then` in runtime.ts:1386 — `(p, cb) => p.then(cb)`. When the compiler emits a `Promise_then` call but the value at runtime isn't a Promise (e.g. it's `undefined` or a non-thenable object), JS throws `TypeError: p.then is not a function`.
- **Why no line number**: The error is thrown in JS host import land. However, V8's stack trace for this error **does include the Wasm call site** that invoked the import, with a byte offset like `at $test (wasm://wasm/abc123:0x1a4f)`. The worker extracts only the function name (line 377: `stack.match(/at (\w+) \(wasm:/)`), discarding the byte offset.
- **Fix**: Extract the byte offset from the stack AND look up `result.sourceMap`. The `extractWasmByteOffset` function already handles this format. Just call it + `lookupSourceMapOffset` in the execution error handler.

#### Pattern 2: `object is not a function` (643 hits)
- **Origin**: Multiple host imports — `__extern_method_call` (runtime.ts:1163), callback dispatch, or attempting to call a non-callable externref. The compiled Wasm calls a host import that expects a function argument but receives something else.
- **Why no line number**: Same as Pattern 1 — the Wasm byte offset in the stack trace is available but not extracted.
- **Fix**: Same as Pattern 1.

#### Pattern 3: `then is not a function` (311 hits)
- **Origin**: `__extern_method_call` (runtime.ts:1163) when calling `.then()` on a non-thenable via the generic method dispatch path (as opposed to the direct `Promise_then` import).
- **Why no line number**: Same as Patterns 1-2.
- **Fix**: Same as Patterns 1-2.

#### Pattern 4: `returned 2 — assert #* (found 0 asserts in source)` (286 hits)
- **Origin**: Test harness. The `wrapTest` function wraps the test body in a `test()` function that returns an assert counter. When the test returns a value > 1, `findNthAssert` in test262-shared.ts:214 searches the **original source** for `assert` calls to identify which assertion failed.
- **Why no line number**: `findNthAssert` searches for lines matching `/\bassert\b/` but many test262 tests use `assert.sameValue`, `assert.throws`, etc. in patterns the regex doesn't match (e.g. multiline calls, or the assert is in a helper that was inlined by the preamble). When it finds 0 asserts, it falls through to the generic message.
- **Fix**: This is a harness improvement. The `findNthAssert` function's regex should also match `assert.sameValue`, `assert.throws`, `assert.notSameValue`, and `$DONOTEVALUATE`. Additionally, since the wrapper already knows the return value, the line offset adjustment (`adjustErrorLines`) should be applied here. **However**, the more impactful fix is to use the source map: the `ret` value identifies which assert failed, and the assert is at a known position in the wrapped source. The compiler can annotate assert positions directly.

#### Pattern 5: `expected parse/early error but compiled and instantiated successfully` (263 hits)
- **Origin**: test262-worker.mjs:289. This is a negative test (metadata says `negative: {phase: "parse"}`) that the compiler accepted and instantiated. It means our compiler is missing a parse/early error check.
- **Why no line number**: This isn't a runtime error per se — it's a semantic gap. The test expects compilation to fail, so there's no execution and no stack trace.
- **Fix**: Line numbers don't apply here — the fix is to implement the missing early errors. This pattern is out of scope for this issue (it's a compiler completeness issue, not a diagnostics issue). We could add the expected error type to the message for better triage: `"expected parse/early SyntaxError but compiled and instantiated successfully"`.

#### Pattern 6: `dereferencing a null pointer [in test()]` (229 hits)
- **Origin**: Wasm trap. V8 raises `RuntimeError: dereferencing a null pointer` when executing `struct.get`, `array.get`, or `ref.cast` on a null ref. The worker catches this as `execErr instanceof Error` (line 373) and extracts the function name from the stack (line 377).
- **Why no line number**: The byte offset IS in the stack trace (V8 format: `at test (wasm://wasm/abc123:0x1a4f)`), but the code only captures the function name, not the offset. `result.sourceMap` is in scope (it's a closure variable from the compile step) but never referenced.
- **Fix**: Call `extractWasmByteOffset(execErr)` and `lookupSourceMapOffset(result.sourceMap, offset)` in the Error branch of the exception handler. Prepend `L{line}:{col}` to the error message.

#### Pattern 7: `illegal cast [in test()]` (165 hits)
- **Origin**: Wasm trap. V8 raises `RuntimeError: illegal cast` when `ref.cast` fails. Same code path as Pattern 6.
- **Why no line number**: Same as Pattern 6.
- **Fix**: Same as Pattern 6 — they share the exact same catch branch.

### Changes

#### Change 1: Wire source map lookup into runtime error handler (Patterns 1-3, 6-7)

**File: `scripts/test262-worker.mjs`**
- In the execution error catch block (line ~350), `result` and `result.sourceMap` are in scope from the compile step above.
- After extracting `errInfo`, add source map lookup:

```js
// After line 382 (end of error extraction), before process.send:
const byteOffset = extractWasmByteOffset(execErr);
const mapped = byteOffset !== undefined && result.sourceMap
  ? lookupSourceMapOffset(result.sourceMap, byteOffset)
  : undefined;
if (mapped) {
  errInfo = `L${mapped.line}:${mapped.column} ${errInfo}`;
}
```

This covers ALL five runtime exception patterns (1, 2, 3, 6, 7) because they all flow through the same catch block at line 350.

**For `WebAssembly.Exception` (line 361)**: These are thrown exceptions (not traps), so V8 doesn't attach a Wasm stack frame to the exception object itself. However, the exception is caught in JS, and the JS catch handler's stack may not contain the Wasm frame. Need to verify experimentally whether `WebAssembly.Exception` has a `.stack` property with Wasm frames. If not, we may need to use `Error.captureStackTrace` or the `--experimental-wasm-stack-switching` V8 flag.

**Estimated effort**: Small (10-15 lines changed in one file). High confidence — the helpers already work for compile errors.

#### Change 2: Improve `findNthAssert` for better assert identification (Pattern 4)

**File: `tests/test262-shared.ts`**
- Function `findNthAssert` (line ~214)
- The regex `/\bassert\b/` is too broad (matches comments, variable names containing "assert") and too narrow (misses `assert.sameValue` when the line starts with whitespace patterns).
- Replace with a more precise pattern:
  ```ts
  const assertPattern = /^\s*(assert\b|assert\.\w+|\$DONOTEVALUATE)/;
  ```
- Also: when `assertStarts.length === 0` and `retVal > 1`, try a fallback: search for the Nth semicolon-terminated statement to at least identify the approximate location.

**Estimated effort**: Small (5-10 lines). Medium impact — only fixes the "found 0 asserts" case, not the root cause (which is incorrect assert counting in the compiled Wasm).

#### Change 3: Enrich negative test failure message (Pattern 5)

**File: `scripts/test262-worker.mjs`**
- Line 289: `error: "expected parse/early error but compiled and instantiated successfully"`
- Add the expected error type from the test metadata:
  ```js
  error: `expected parse/early ${msg.expectedErrorType || "error"} but compiled and instantiated successfully`
  ```
- This requires passing `meta.negative.type` through the pool message. Currently the pool only receives `isNegative: boolean`.

**File: `tests/test262-shared.ts`**
- In the `pool.runTest()` call (line ~384), add `expectedErrorType: meta.negative?.type` to the options.

**File: `scripts/compiler-pool.ts`**
- Extend the message type to include `expectedErrorType?: string`.

**Estimated effort**: Small (3-5 lines across 3 files). Low impact — this is a diagnostic improvement, not a line number.

#### Change 4: Pass source map to the result for harness-side enrichment (optional)

**File: `tests/test262-shared.ts`**
- Currently `result.sourceMap` is not returned from the pool to the harness. The `TestResult` interface (compiler-pool.ts:36) doesn't include `sourceMap`.
- If we want the harness to do additional source-map-based enrichment (e.g., for the `returned N` pattern), we'd need to include the source map in the result. But this is expensive (large string over IPC).
- **Better approach**: Do all source map lookups in the worker (Change 1), which already has the source map in memory. The worker should send back the resolved line number, not the raw source map.

### Edge cases

- **Multiple Wasm frames in stack**: V8 stack traces may contain multiple `wasm://` frames (e.g., `test` calls `helper` which traps). `extractWasmByteOffset` finds the FIRST match, which may be the innermost frame (the trap site). This is correct — we want the source location of the actual error.
- **Inlined functions**: If the Wasm optimizer inlines functions, byte offsets may not map accurately. Our source maps are generated pre-optimization, so if `--optimize` is used, mappings may be wrong. The test262 runner does NOT use `--optimize`, so this is not a concern.
- **`WebAssembly.Exception` stack traces**: V8 may or may not include Wasm frames in the `.stack` property of `WebAssembly.Exception`. If not, we get line numbers for traps (patterns 6-7) but not for thrown exceptions that propagate through host imports (patterns 1-3). This needs experimental verification.
- **`adjustErrorLines` interaction**: The harness already adjusts `Lx:y` patterns by `lineAdjustOffset` (the preamble line count from `wrapTest`). Source map line numbers from the compiler are relative to the **wrapped source**, not the original test source. So the adjustment in `adjustErrorLines` (test262-shared.ts:206) should apply to source-map-derived line numbers too. However, since the worker generates the line numbers and the harness adjusts them, this should work automatically.
- **Wrapped source line offset**: The source map maps Wasm byte offsets to TypeScript source lines. The TS source IS the wrapped test (with preamble). Line numbers from the source map are therefore offset by `bodyLineOffset`. The harness already handles this via `adjustErrorLines`. No extra work needed.

### Wasm IR pattern

No Wasm IR changes needed. The source map is already generated by the compiler. The fix is entirely in the test runner infrastructure.

### Recommended implementation order

1. **Change 1** (highest impact, lowest effort) — Wire source map into runtime error handler. Fixes patterns 6+7 immediately (394 hits), and likely patterns 1-3 (2,570 hits) if `WebAssembly.Exception`/host errors carry Wasm stack frames.
2. **Change 2** (medium impact) — Improve `findNthAssert` regex. Fixes pattern 4 (286 hits).
3. **Change 3** (low impact, very low effort) — Enrich negative test message. Improves triage for pattern 5 (263 hits).
4. **Change 4** (skip) — Not needed if Change 1 handles everything in-worker.

### Test files to verify

After implementing Change 1, run a small batch of tests that currently produce these error patterns and verify that the JSONL output now includes `Lx:y` prefixes:
- Any async test that produces `p.then is not a function`
- Any test with `dereferencing a null pointer`
- Any test with `illegal cast`

Compare the `L` line number against the original test262 source to verify accuracy.
