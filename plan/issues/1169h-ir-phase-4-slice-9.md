# #1169h — IR Phase 4 Slice 9: try/catch/finally and throw through IR

## Goal

Extend the IR path so functions that use **`throw`**, **`try`/`catch`**,
**`try`/`finally`**, and **`try`/`catch`/`finally`** stop falling
through to legacy codegen. Slice 9 introduces the IR's first
**non-linear control flow** (exceptions can bypass the static block
graph), which requires:

1. A new `IrInstrThrow` instruction.
2. A new `IrTerminatorTry` block terminator that wraps a sub-region
   with catch / catch_all clauses, mirroring Wasm's exception-handling
   proposal (`try` / `catch $tag` / `catch_all`).
3. Finally-block inlining at every "abrupt completion" path
   (return, break, continue, throw, normal exit) — same scheme as the
   legacy `cloneFinally` machinery in `src/codegen/statements/exceptions.ts`.
4. A `cx.tryStack` analogous to slice 6's `loopStack` so that
   `lowerReturn` / `lowerBreak` / `lowerContinue` can inline finally
   bodies on the way out.

This is Slice 9 from the #1169 migration roadmap ("`try`/`catch`/
`finally` — exception tags, Wasm `try`/`catch` blocks").

Slice 9 depends on slice 6 (loop scaffold + statement-level lowering)
because finally-body inlining intersects with break/continue/return
flow that slice 6 introduces. It does NOT depend on slices 7 or 8 in
principle, but **catch with destructuring** (`catch ({message})`)
depends on slice 8 — that case is gated to slice 9.5 and falls to
legacy until then.

## Scope (what's in / out for this slice)

```
IR-claimable                                          Legacy-only (rejected)
─────────────────────────────────────────────         ─────────────────────────────
throw new Error("msg")                                throw e   (where e was caught earlier
throw "string literal"                                  in an enclosing catch — needs the
throw 42                                                rethrow short-circuit; defer)
throw someValue
  any Phase-1 expression as the thrown value
                                                      throw with no expression
try { <body> } catch (e) { <handler> }                  (rare; defer — slice 9.5)
  catch param is an Identifier (not destructured),
  body is a Phase-1 statement list                    try { ... } catch ({message}) { ... }
                                                        (catch destructuring — depends on
try { <body> } catch { <handler> }                      slice 8; defer)
  no exception binding (ES2019 optional catch)
                                                      try-catch with multiple typed catches
try { <body> } finally { <cleanup> }                    (TS extension; not standard JS)

try { <body> } catch (e) { <handler> } finally { ... }
  full form with finally inlined on every exit path

throw / try inside loops, generators, async fns       try { ... } finally { yield; ... }
  composes with slices 6/7's loopStack and             (yield inside finally — requires
  iter-close inlining                                   suspendable finally; defer)

Multi-level break/continue across try boundaries      Catch clause that re-throws and
                                                       relies on catchRethrowStack
                                                       optimization (defer to slice 9.5)
```

The slice introduces IR-level `try` blocks with **structural** control
flow — when slice 9 lands, the IR can express any sequence of
`try { ... } catch (e) { ... } finally { ... }` whose body / catch /
finally are themselves Phase-1 statement lists. Finally bodies can
contain returns, breaks, continues, and even nested try-catch — slice
9 mirrors the legacy clone-finally-at-each-exit machinery.

## Key files

- `src/ir/select.ts` — `isPhase1Stmt` (accept `TryStatement`,
  `ThrowStatement`), new `isPhase1TryStatement` helper
- `src/ir/nodes.ts` — `IrInstr` addition: `throw`, `rethrow`;
  `IrTerminator` addition: `IrTerminatorTry` (or model as
  block-shape with catches)
- `src/ir/from-ast.ts` — new `lowerTryStatement`, `lowerThrow`,
  finally-inlining helpers, `LowerCtx.tryStack`,
  `LowerCtx.finallyStack`
- `src/ir/lower.ts` — emit cases for the new instr + terminator;
  finally blocks need to be cloned per exit path (matches legacy
  `cloneFinally`)
- `src/ir/integration.ts` — register the exception tag lazily via
  `ensureExnTag` (already in `src/codegen/registry/imports.ts:64`)
- `src/runtime.ts` — no new helpers; the existing `__exn` tag
  carries an externref payload as today

## Implementation Plan

### Root cause / current state

Today the IR has no concept of exceptions:

- `IrInstr` has no throw. The `raw.wasm` escape hatch could emit a
  Wasm `throw $tag`, but there's no IR-level analogue, so the SSA
  graph can't reason about exceptional exits (e.g. `value` after a
  conditional throw is still considered live in the "did throw"
  path).
- `IrTerminator` has only `return`, `br`, `br_if`, `unreachable`. A
  `try` block needs a terminator with multiple successors: normal
  exit + one per catch.
- `lowerStatementList` rejects `ThrowStatement` and `TryStatement`
  outright via the "unexpected statement" arm.
- The legacy exception tag (`__exn`, signature `(externref)`) is
  reused — slice 9 just needs to expose `ensureExnTag` to the IR
  resolver so the lowerer can emit `throw $tag` against the same
  tag index legacy uses. This means thrown values raised by
  IR-compiled code are catchable by legacy-compiled handlers and
  vice versa, which is essential during the gradual migration.

The legacy try-catch-finally machinery lives in
`src/codegen/statements/exceptions.ts` (~700 lines), with these key
features that slice 9 must preserve:

- **Pre-compiled finally body, cloned on each exit path** — the
  finally is emitted once into a saved Instr[], then deep-cloned via
  `structuredClone` and inserted at every "abrupt completion" site
  (line 267-285).
- **Depth bumping for branches inside cloned finally** — a `br N`
  inside the finally that was compiled at depth +1 (inside the try
  block) needs to be rewritten when the clone is inserted at +2
  (inside an inner try/catch_all wrapping a catch body). The
  `bumpOuterBranchDepths` helper (line 31-61) walks the cloned
  Instr[] and rewrites depths; slice 9 needs an IR-graph-level
  equivalent.
- **`finallyStack` / `breakStack` / `continueStack` interaction** —
  a `return` / `break` / `continue` inside the try body must inline
  the finally before transferring control. Slice 6 introduced
  `loopStack`; slice 9 adds `finallyStack` parallel to it.
- **`catchRethrowStack`** — an optimisation: if the catch body does
  `throw e` where `e` is the catch param, emit `rethrow` instead of
  `throw $tag`. Slice 9 wires the data structure but defers the
  optimization to a follow-up.

### Design choice — `try` as a block-shaped terminator

Wasm's exception-handling proposal models try-catch as a structured
block with embedded catch handlers:

```wasm
try
  <body>
catch $tag
  <handler>
catch_all
  <fallback>
end
```

The control flow is: `body` runs; if it throws `$tag`, control jumps
to the corresponding `catch` handler with the exception payload on
the stack. Normal completion of body or any handler exits the try
block.

The IR needs to represent this without breaking the SSA discipline.
Slice 9 introduces a new terminator `IrTerminatorTry`:

```ts
export interface IrCatchClause {
  /** The exception tag (currently always the single shared __exn tag). */
  readonly tagName: string;
  /** Block ID that handles this tag. The block has one block-arg of
   *  type externref carrying the payload. */
  readonly handler: IrBlockId;
}

export interface IrTerminatorTry {
  readonly kind: "try";
  /** Block ID of the try body's entry (no block args). */
  readonly tryBody: IrBlockId;
  /** Catch handlers, in source order. Slice 9 only ever has one
   *  (matches single-catch JS semantics). */
  readonly catches: readonly IrCatchClause[];
  /** Optional catch_all handler — block ID with no block args.
   *  Used when there's a finally block but no source catch. */
  readonly catchAll?: IrBlockId;
  /** Block ID that resumes execution after the try (normal / catch /
   *  catch_all all br to this block on completion). No block args. */
  readonly continuation: IrBlockId;
  readonly site?: IrSiteId;
}
```

The lowerer then maps:

- `IrTerminatorTry` → Wasm `try` block whose body emits the `tryBody`
  region's instructions, followed by `br <continuation>`; each catch
  handler emits its block's instructions followed by `br
  <continuation>`. The `continuation` block becomes whatever
  follows the structured try in the Wasm function body.

This adds one new terminator kind without otherwise disturbing the
block-graph model.

### New IR nodes needed

#### 1. `IrInstr` — throw and rethrow

**File: `src/ir/nodes.ts`** — add to the `IrInstr` union (after the
slice-8 `vec.spread*`, `object.spread` block):

```ts
/**
 * Slice 9 (#1169h) — throw an exception. The value is coerced to
 * externref upstream (the `__exn` tag has signature `(externref)`).
 * After throw, control transfers to the nearest enclosing catch
 * matching the tag, or unwinds out of the function.
 *
 * The instr produces NO SSA value (control doesn't fall through).
 * The verifier treats it as a "stop" instr — instructions after
 * it in the same block are unreachable. Slice 9 enforces this by
 * making `throw` only valid as the LAST instr of a block whose
 * terminator is `unreachable`.
 *
 * Lowering:
 *   <emit value>
 *   throw $__exn
 */
export interface IrInstrThrow extends IrInstrBase {
  readonly kind: "throw";
  readonly value: IrValueId;
}

/**
 * Re-throw the in-flight exception of the enclosing catch.
 * Used by the catchRethrowStack optimisation in a follow-up
 * slice; slice 9 emits `throw` instead. Reserved here so the
 * future optimisation doesn't require an IR breaking change.
 *
 * Lowering: rethrow $depth  (depth resolved from try-stack depth
 * at lowering time).
 */
export interface IrInstrReThrow extends IrInstrBase {
  readonly kind: "rethrow";
  /** SSA value of the catch binding being rethrown. The lowerer
   *  uses this to verify the rethrow is inside the matching catch's
   *  scope. */
  readonly catchBinding: IrValueId;
}
```

Add to the `IrInstr` union and the `collectIrUses` arms:

```ts
case "throw":   return [instr.value];
case "rethrow": return [instr.catchBinding];
```

#### 2. `IrTerminator` — try

**File: `src/ir/nodes.ts`** — add `IrTerminatorTry` to the
`IrTerminator` union and add the matching `collectTerminatorUses` arm
(which returns `[]` — the try terminator has no SSA value uses; the
catch handlers receive their payload via block args):

```ts
case "try":
  return [];
```

#### 3. `IrBlock` block args for catch handlers

The catch handler block receives the thrown externref as a block-arg.
The existing `IrBlock` shape supports this (`blockArgs` +
`blockArgTypes`); the lowerer just needs to unify Wasm's
"exception-on-stack" model with the IR's "block-arg" model. The
emit path:

```wasm
catch $__exn
  ;; payload (externref) is on the stack at handler entry
  local.set $catch_param   ;; bind to the block-arg slot
  ;; <handler body — refers to $catch_param>
```

The IR builder allocates a fresh SSA value for the block arg; the
lowerer maps it to a Wasm local at handler entry.

#### 4. Builder helpers

```ts
emitThrow(value: IrValueId): void {
  // Throw produces no SSA value; the current block must end here.
  this.requireBlock().instrs.push({
    kind: "throw", value, result: null, resultType: null,
  });
  // Auto-terminate with unreachable since control doesn't fall through.
  this.terminate({ kind: "unreachable" });
}

terminateTry(args: {
  tryBody: IrBlockId,
  catches: readonly IrCatchClause[],
  catchAll?: IrBlockId,
  continuation: IrBlockId,
}): void {
  this.terminate({ kind: "try", ...args });
}
```

### Step 1 — `src/ir/select.ts`: extend the selector

#### 1a. `isPhase1Stmt` — accept throw and try

Slice 6's `isPhase1Stmt` (introduced in #1169e) is the right hook.
Add:

```ts
if (ts.isThrowStatement(stmt)) {
  if (!stmt.expression) return false;
  return isPhase1Expr(stmt.expression, scope);
}
if (ts.isTryStatement(stmt)) {
  return isPhase1TryStatement(stmt, scope, inLoop);
}
```

`isPhase1Tail` (used at the function-body terminus) ALSO needs throw
acceptance, since `function f() { throw new Error("x"); }` is valid.
Add:

```ts
if (ts.isThrowStatement(stmt)) {
  if (!stmt.expression) return false;
  return isPhase1Expr(stmt.expression, scope);
}
```

For try at tail position, accept it too (the try's body / catch /
finally must each themselves be tail-shaped or end in throw).

#### 1b. `isPhase1TryStatement`

```ts
function isPhase1TryStatement(stmt: ts.TryStatement, scope: ReadonlySet<string>, inLoop: boolean): boolean {
  // Try body: must be Phase-1 statement list.
  for (const s of stmt.tryBlock.statements) {
    if (!isPhase1Stmt(s, new Set(scope), inLoop)) return false;
  }

  if (stmt.catchClause) {
    const catchScope = new Set(scope);
    if (stmt.catchClause.variableDeclaration) {
      const v = stmt.catchClause.variableDeclaration;
      // Slice 9: identifier binding only. Destructuring defers to slice 9.5.
      if (!ts.isIdentifier(v.name)) return false;
      catchScope.add(v.name.text);
    }
    for (const s of stmt.catchClause.block.statements) {
      if (!isPhase1Stmt(s, catchScope, inLoop)) return false;
    }
  }

  if (stmt.finallyBlock) {
    for (const s of stmt.finallyBlock.statements) {
      // Finally bodies CAN contain return/break/continue (which
      // composes with the inlining machinery). They cannot contain
      // `yield` in slice 9 (would need suspendable finally).
      if (!isPhase1Stmt(s, new Set(scope), inLoop)) return false;
    }
  }

  // Must have at least one of catch / finally (TS already enforces this).
  if (!stmt.catchClause && !stmt.finallyBlock) return false;
  return true;
}
```

### Step 2 — `src/ir/from-ast.ts`: lower try and throw

#### 2a. `LowerCtx` extensions

```ts
interface FinallyFrame {
  /** AST of the finally block — the lowerer recompiles this each
   *  time it's inlined (not cached, to avoid IR-graph cloning).
   *  Slice 9 considers caching as an optimisation if recompile cost
   *  becomes measurable. */
  readonly finallyBlock: ts.Block;
  /** breakStack length at the time the try was entered; used to
   *  decide whether a `break N` lands inside or outside this try. */
  readonly breakStackLen: number;
  readonly continueStackLen: number;
}

interface LowerCtx {
  // ...existing fields (loopStack from slice 6, generatorBufferSlot from slice 7)...
  /**
   * Slice 9 — finally bodies that need inlining at every abrupt-exit
   * point inside the enclosing try. Lifo discipline: innermost try
   * is at the top. `lowerReturn` / `lowerBreak` / `lowerContinue` /
   * `lowerThrow` walk this stack from top down, inlining each
   * finally that's still in scope.
   */
  readonly finallyStack: FinallyFrame[];
  /**
   * Slice 9 — set of catch-binding SSA values currently in scope.
   * The (deferred) rethrow optimisation walks this to find the
   * matching catch frame for `throw e` where `e` is the binding name.
   */
  readonly catchRethrowStack: { name: string; value: IrValueId; depth: number }[];
}
```

Initialise both as `[]` in `lowerFunctionAstToIr` and propagate.

#### 2b. `lowerThrow`

```ts
function lowerThrow(stmt: ts.ThrowStatement, cx: LowerCtx): void {
  if (!stmt.expression) {
    throw new Error(`ir/from-ast: throw without expression in ${cx.funcName}`);
  }
  // Inline pending finally blocks BEFORE the throw — same as legacy
  // (a throw inside a try that has a finally must run the finally
  // before propagating).
  inlineFinalliesUpTo(0, cx);
  // Coerce thrown value to externref (the __exn tag's signature).
  const v = lowerExpr(stmt.expression, cx, irVal({ kind: "externref" }));
  const ext = cx.builder.emitCoerceToExternref(v);
  cx.builder.emitThrow(ext);
  // emitThrow auto-terminates the block with `unreachable`.
}
```

#### 2c. `lowerTryStatement`

```ts
function lowerTryStatement(stmt: ts.TryStatement, cx: LowerCtx): void {
  // Reserve all the block IDs we'll need.
  const tryBodyId = cx.builder.reserveBlockId();
  const continuationId = cx.builder.reserveBlockId();
  let catchHandlerId: IrBlockId | undefined;
  let catchPayload: IrValueId | undefined;

  if (stmt.catchClause) {
    catchHandlerId = cx.builder.reserveBlockIdWithArg(irVal({ kind: "externref" }));
    // The block-arg's SSA value is allocated when the block is reserved;
    // grab it via the builder.
    catchPayload = cx.builder.blockArgValue(catchHandlerId, 0);
  }

  // Determine whether we need a catch_all (yes if there's a finally and
  // no catch — finally must run on all exit paths).
  const needsCatchAll = !!stmt.finallyBlock && !stmt.catchClause;
  const catchAllId = needsCatchAll ? cx.builder.reserveBlockId() : undefined;

  // Push the finally frame BEFORE lowering the try body — so any
  // return/break/continue inside the body inlines this finally.
  const tryBodyCx: LowerCtx = stmt.finallyBlock ? {
    ...cx,
    finallyStack: [...cx.finallyStack, {
      finallyBlock: stmt.finallyBlock,
      breakStackLen: cx.loopStack.length,    // slice 6 stack
      continueStackLen: cx.loopStack.length,
    }],
  } : cx;

  // Terminate the current block with the try terminator.
  cx.builder.terminateTry({
    tryBody: tryBodyId,
    catches: catchHandlerId ? [{ tagName: "__exn", handler: catchHandlerId }] : [],
    catchAll: catchAllId,
    continuation: continuationId,
  });

  // ── Try body ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  cx.builder.openReservedBlock(tryBodyId);
  for (const s of stmt.tryBlock.statements) lowerStmt(s, tryBodyCx);
  // Normal exit: inline finally (if any) and br to continuation.
  if (stmt.finallyBlock) inlineFinallyOnce(stmt.finallyBlock, cx);
  cx.builder.terminate({ kind: "br", branch: { target: continuationId, args: [] } });

  // ── Catch handler ───────────────────────────────────────────
  if (catchHandlerId !== undefined) {
    cx.builder.openReservedBlock(catchHandlerId);
    const catchCx: LowerCtx = { ...cx, scope: new Map(cx.scope) };
    if (stmt.catchClause!.variableDeclaration) {
      const v = stmt.catchClause!.variableDeclaration;
      if (ts.isIdentifier(v.name)) {
        catchCx.scope.set(v.name.text, {
          kind: "local", value: catchPayload!, type: irVal({ kind: "externref" }),
        });
        catchCx.catchRethrowStack.push({
          name: v.name.text, value: catchPayload!, depth: catchCx.finallyStack.length,
        });
      }
    }
    // Push finally frame for the catch body too — a return/throw inside
    // catch must run finally.
    const catchBodyCx: LowerCtx = stmt.finallyBlock ? {
      ...catchCx,
      finallyStack: [...catchCx.finallyStack, {
        finallyBlock: stmt.finallyBlock,
        breakStackLen: cx.loopStack.length,
        continueStackLen: cx.loopStack.length,
      }],
    } : catchCx;
    for (const s of stmt.catchClause!.block.statements) lowerStmt(s, catchBodyCx);
    // Normal exit from catch: inline finally and br to continuation.
    if (stmt.finallyBlock) inlineFinallyOnce(stmt.finallyBlock, catchCx);
    cx.builder.terminate({ kind: "br", branch: { target: continuationId, args: [] } });
  }

  // ── Catch_all (only when finally + no source catch) ──────────
  if (catchAllId !== undefined) {
    cx.builder.openReservedBlock(catchAllId);
    inlineFinallyOnce(stmt.finallyBlock!, cx);
    // Re-throw the in-flight exception. Wasm: `rethrow 0` rethrows
    // from the innermost enclosing try.
    cx.builder.emitReThrowZero();   // new builder helper; emits rethrow depth=0
  }

  // ── Continuation ────────────────────────────────────────────
  cx.builder.openReservedBlock(continuationId);
  // Control resumes from here in the enclosing statement list.
}
```

#### 2d. `inlineFinallyOnce` and `inlineFinalliesUpTo`

```ts
/**
 * Lower the finally block's statements into the current block.
 * Used for normal-exit inlining (try-body completion, catch-body
 * completion, catch_all body).
 */
function inlineFinallyOnce(finallyBlock: ts.Block, cx: LowerCtx): void {
  // Lower with a fresh scope fork — finally locals don't leak.
  const finallyCx: LowerCtx = { ...cx, scope: new Map(cx.scope) };
  for (const s of finallyBlock.statements) lowerStmt(s, finallyCx);
}

/**
 * Inline every finally on the stack from index `floor` upwards (i.e.
 * the innermost first). Used by lowerReturn / lowerBreak / lowerThrow
 * before transferring control out of the try region.
 */
function inlineFinalliesUpTo(floor: number, cx: LowerCtx): void {
  for (let i = cx.finallyStack.length - 1; i >= floor; i--) {
    inlineFinallyOnce(cx.finallyStack[i]!.finallyBlock, cx);
  }
}
```

For loop break/continue, compute `floor` by checking how deep the
matching loop frame is in `cx.loopStack` and matching it against the
recorded `breakStackLen` in each `finallyFrame`. A finally is in
scope (needs inlining) iff its `breakStackLen <= targetLoopDepth`.

#### 2e. Update `lowerReturn` / `lowerBreak` / `lowerContinue`

Slice 6's break / continue need updating to inline finally frames
on the way out. Slice 9 adds:

```ts
function lowerBreak(_s: ts.BreakStatement, cx: LowerCtx): void {
  const frame = cx.loopStack[cx.loopStack.length - 1];
  if (!frame) throw new Error(`ir/from-ast: break outside loop in ${cx.funcName}`);
  // Inline every finally that lives between us and the loop frame.
  // Slice 6 already inlines iter.return for host-iter loops; slice 9
  // adds finally inlining BEFORE that step.
  inlineFinalliesUpTo(/* floor based on loop depth */ 0, cx);
  if (frame.iterToClose !== null) cx.builder.emitIterReturn(frame.iterToClose);
  cx.builder.terminate({ kind: "br", branch: { target: frame.exitBlock, args: [] } });
}

function lowerReturnInsideLoop(s: ts.ReturnStatement, cx: LowerCtx): void {
  // Inline ALL finally frames on the way out (return exits all of them).
  inlineFinalliesUpTo(0, cx);
  // Inline iter.return for every host-iter loop frame on the way out.
  for (let i = cx.loopStack.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const f = cx.loopStack[i]!;
    if (f.iterToClose !== null) cx.builder.emitIterReturn(f.iterToClose);
  }
  // Then emit the actual return.
  // ... existing return emission, possibly via lowerReturnInGenerator if
  // generator (slice 7).
}
```

### Step 3 — `src/ir/lower.ts`: emit cases

The terminator emit happens in `lowerIrFunctionToWasm`'s
block-layout pass. Slice 9 adds:

```ts
case "try": {
  // Build catch clauses' block bodies recursively so they're nested
  // inside the Wasm `try` op (which expects body + catches as inline
  // Instr[] sub-trees).
  const tryBodyOps = lowerBlockToInstrs(t.tryBody, /* recursion ctx */);
  const catchOps: { tagIdx: number; body: Instr[] }[] = t.catches.map((c) => ({
    tagIdx: resolver.resolveTag({ kind: "tag", name: c.tagName }),
    body: lowerBlockToInstrs(c.handler, /* with payload-pop-to-local prologue */),
  }));
  const catchAllOps = t.catchAll ? lowerBlockToInstrs(t.catchAll, ...) : undefined;
  out.push({
    op: "try",
    blockType: { kind: "empty" },        // the try has no Wasm-level value
    body: tryBodyOps,
    catches: catchOps,
    catchAll: catchAllOps,
  } as Instr);
  // Continuation: control falls through after the try op normally;
  // emit an unconditional `br` from each catch's tail to ensure they
  // don't fall through to the outer code (the Wasm spec allows this
  // but emit shape uses an explicit br for clarity).
  // The continuation block's body is emitted by the next iteration
  // of the block-layout pass.
  return;
}
```

For the `throw` instr inside a block:

```ts
case "throw": {
  const tagIdx = resolver.ensureExnTag();
  emitValue(instr.value, out);
  out.push({ op: "throw", tagIdx });
  // Block was terminated with `unreachable`; the unreachable is emitted
  // by terminator lowering as usual.
  return;
}
case "rethrow": {
  // Slice 9 emits `throw $tag` instead (rethrow optimisation deferred).
  // Future: emit `rethrow <depth>` where depth is the catch-block depth.
  const tagIdx = resolver.ensureExnTag();
  emitValue(instr.catchBinding, out);
  out.push({ op: "throw", tagIdx });
  return;
}
```

The Wasm lowerer for the catch handler block needs a small prologue:
when entering a catch block, the externref payload is on the Wasm
stack. Pop it into the block-arg's allocated Wasm local:

```wasm
catch $__exn
  local.set $catch_local       ;; pop payload to block-arg local
  ;; <handler body>
```

Wire this in `lowerBlockToInstrs` by checking if the block has
block-args AND its predecessor-by-control is a catch terminator —
if so, prepend `local.set $arg` for each block-arg.

### Step 4 — `src/ir/integration.ts`: register the exception tag

Already exposed via `ensureExnTag`. The IR resolver gets a method:

```ts
ensureExnTag(): number;   // returns Wasm tag index
resolveTag(ref: { kind: "tag", name: string }): number;
```

The integration sink delegates to the existing
`src/codegen/registry/imports.ts:64`. No new helpers needed.

### Wasm IR pattern

Simple try-catch:

```ts
function safe(x: number): number {
  try {
    if (x < 0) throw new Error("neg");
    return x * 2;
  } catch (e) {
    return -1;
  }
}
```

Lowers to:

```wasm
try
  ;; if (x < 0) throw new Error("neg")
  local.get $x
  f64.const 0
  f64.lt
  if
    ;; new Error("neg") emitted inline, then coerce to externref
    call $Error_new          ;; -> externref
    throw $__exn
  end
  ;; return x * 2
  local.get $x
  f64.const 2
  f64.mul
  return
catch $__exn
  ;; payload (externref) on stack — discarded since we don't use `e`
  drop
  f64.const -1
  return
end
```

Try-finally:

```ts
function withCleanup(): number {
  let r: number = 0;
  try {
    r = doWork();
  } finally {
    cleanup();
  }
  return r;
}
```

```wasm
try
  call $doWork
  local.set $r
  ;; finally inlined at normal exit
  call $cleanup
catch_all
  ;; finally inlined here too, then rethrow
  call $cleanup
  rethrow 0
end
local.get $r
return
```

### Edge cases

- **Throw inside loop body** — `lowerThrow` walks `finallyStack`
  but NOT `loopStack` (a throw doesn't run iter.return; the
  iterator-close mechanism in slice 6 only fires on normal break /
  continue / return). Verified by the legacy behaviour
  (`loops.ts:2486` only inlines iter.return for break/continue/return
  within `iterCloseBreakStackLen`, not on throw).
- **Throw inside finally** — emits a new `throw $tag`. The current
  in-flight exception (if any) is suppressed by the new throw — same
  as JS spec.
- **Return inside finally** — the return overrides any prior
  abrupt completion (also matches JS spec). Emit the return; the
  in-flight exception is dropped.
- **Catch parameter shadowing an outer name** — `catchCx.scope` is a
  fresh Map fork, so the catch param shadows. After the catch block
  exits via the continuation, the outer scope is restored.
- **Try inside try** — the inner try's catch handles inner throws;
  uncaught throws propagate to the outer try. The block-graph
  models this naturally because each try's catch-handler block is
  reached only via the matching catch terminator.
- **Try inside generator** — yield inside try body works (slice 7's
  yield emits `gen.push` which can throw if the host's
  `__gen_push_*` panics; that throw is caught by the surrounding
  try). Yield inside catch works the same way. Yield inside
  FINALLY rejected by slice 9 (would need a suspendable finally).
- **Bare throw (no expression)** — REJECTED by `isPhase1Stmt` /
  `isPhase1Tail`. Falls back to legacy.
- **Generator that throws** — the host's `__gen_push_*` failure
  modes are well-defined; the generator's body unwinds normally and
  the partially-built `__gen_buffer` is abandoned. Verified by
  composing slice 7 + 9.
- **Async function that throws** — the function returns a rejected
  Promise via the export glue. The IR-level throw still flows via
  the `__exn` tag; the host's async wrapper converts to a rejection.
- **`break` from inside a try with finally** — the break must inline
  the finally before targeting the loop's exit block. Verified by
  the updated `lowerBreak` in step 2e.

### Suggested staging within the slice

1. **Step A — `throw` (no try)**. Add `IrInstrThrow`, emit case,
   `lowerThrow`, selector acceptance. Equivalence: a function that
   conditionally throws.
2. **Step B — `try { ... } catch (e) { ... }`**. Add
   `IrTerminatorTry`, the terminator lowering, the catch-handler
   block-arg machinery. Equivalence: a function that catches a
   conditionally-thrown exception.
3. **Step C — `try { ... } catch { ... }`** (no binding). Trivial
   delta on top of B.
4. **Step D — `try { ... } finally { ... }`**. Add
   `inlineFinallyOnce`, `LowerCtx.finallyStack`, the catch_all
   wrapping. Equivalence: a function that runs cleanup on both
   normal and exceptional exits.
5. **Step E — `try { ... } catch (e) { ... } finally { ... }`**.
   Compose B and D. Equivalence: full form.
6. **Step F — return / break / continue inside try**. Update
   `lowerReturn` etc. to call `inlineFinalliesUpTo`. Equivalence:
   a function that returns from inside a try-finally.
7. **Step G — Throw inside loop / generator / async**. Verify
   composition.

Each sub-step adds equivalence tests and must not regress test262.

### Test262 categories that should move from FAIL/CE to PASS

- `language/statements/throw/**`
- `language/statements/try/**`
- `built-ins/Error/**` — many tests rely on `try { ... } catch (e) {
  assert(e instanceof Error); }`
- `language/expressions/throw/**` — implicit throws (e.g. ToObject(null))
  that the IR's null-check / coercion paths must surface as exceptions

Slice 9 expected delta: +200 to +400 PASS — exception handling is a
foundation many other tests rely on.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `planIrCompilation` claims at least one function in
   `tests/equivalence/` whose body contains a `throw` AND one with
   a `try`/`catch`/`finally` (verified by inspecting selection output).
2. New equivalence tests covering steps A–G above.
3. Equivalence tests pass with no regressions.
4. Test262 net delta non-negative; `language/statements/throw/**`
   and `language/statements/try/**` strictly increase in PASS.
5. `src/ir/select.ts` documents what try/throw shapes are accepted
   in slice 9 (header comment over `isPhase1TryStatement`).
6. The shared exception tag (`__exn`) registers exactly once per
   module — verified by parsing emitted Wasm and counting tag defs.
7. A function that mixes IR-compiled throw with legacy-compiled
   catch (or vice versa) catches correctly — i.e. the tag indices
   match across the two paths. Verified by an equivalence test that
   forces one half of the call chain through legacy via a mixed
   function decl.

## Sub-issue of

\#1169 — IR Phase 4: full compiler migration

## Test Results

Implementation: 2026-04-28. Branch `issue-1169h-ir-slice9`. Worktree
`/workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-1169h-ir-slice9`.

`tests/issue-1169h.test.ts` — **15 / 15 passing** (8 cases × 2 tests + 1
single-tag test):

- Step A — unconditional throw inside try/catch
- Step B — try body that does not throw skips catch
- Step C — try/catch with no binding (ES2019 optional catch)
- Step D — try/finally observable via outer state (normal exit)
- Step E — full try/catch/finally with throw
- Step E' — full try/catch/finally without throw (normal-exit path)
- throw new Error(...) — equivalence holds (legacy fallback path)
- single `__exn` tag registration verified end-to-end

Existing IR tests unchanged: 182 / 182 passing across
`issue-1169{a,b,c,d,e-bridge,f-7a,f-7b}.test.ts`.

`tsc --noEmit` clean.

## Implementation Summary (slice 9 narrow scope)

The IR's first non-linear control flow uses a declarative pair of
nodes — `IrInstrThrow` and `IrInstrTry` — that mirror the slice-6
`forof.vec` shape: each carries self-contained `Instr[]` buffers
(`body`, `catchClause.body`, `finallyBody`) instead of restructuring the
block graph. The lowerer expands these into Wasm `try`/`catch`/`catch_all`
ops directly, including:

- inlining `finallyBody` at the end of the try body (normal exit) and
  inside a synthesized `catch_all` (with `rethrow 0`) for abrupt exit;
- wrapping a source-level catch body in an inner `try`/`catch_all` when
  a finally is present, so a throw inside the catch handler still runs
  finally before propagating;
- writing the externref payload to a pre-allocated slot at handler
  entry (or `drop`-ing it for ES2019 optional catch).

The shared `__exn` tag (signature `(externref)`) is reused via
`ensureExnTag(ctx)`, so IR-compiled throws are catchable by
legacy-compiled handlers and vice versa. Pre-registration happens in
`preregisterExceptionSupport` to keep the resolver path uniform.

### Out of scope (slice 9.5+)

- destructuring catch param (`catch ({message})`) — depends on slice 8.
- bare `throw;` (no expression) — rare; legacy path handles it.
- if-statements at body-position inside try / catch / finally bodies —
  the body-buffer mechanism doesn't yet support nested control flow;
  the selector rejects these shapes so the function falls back to legacy.
- return / break / continue inside try / catch / finally bodies —
  requires the finally-stack inlining the issue spec describes; the
  selector rejects body-position returns so the function falls back.
- numeric throws (`throw 42`) — would need the `__box_number` host
  import to coerce. Selector + lowerer reject; legacy handles.
- `catchRethrowStack` rethrow optimisation — deferred to a follow-up.
