# #182 — Arrow function closure type coercion errors

## Status: backlog

## Summary
12+ arrow function tests fail with wasm validation "call[0] expected type externref" errors. Arrow functions that capture outer variables may not correctly coerce types when the variable is used across closure boundaries.

## Motivation
12 test262 compile errors in `language/expressions/arrow-function` with identical error: `call[0] expected type externref, found ...`. This suggests arrow function closures are passing values with wrong types to captured functions or host imports.

Additional ~25 arrow function tests have TS type-not-assignable errors (covered by #145).

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — arrow function/closure codegen
- Type coercion at closure capture/use boundaries

## Complexity
M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Arrow functions correctly coerce captured variable types
- [ ] 12 test262 arrow-function wasm validation errors fixed
