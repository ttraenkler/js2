# Issue 76: Rope/cons-string for O(1) concatenation

## Current status

**Blocked — depends on #75 (string views).** The rope design requires the
FlatString to have the offset field from #75. Once #75 is merged, this can
proceed. Additionally, implementing WasmGC subtyping (String base type with
FlatString/ConsString subtypes) is a significant architectural change that
needs careful design to avoid breaking the existing type system.

## Summary

Implement a rope (cons-string) representation for string concatenation so that
`a + b` creates a lightweight tree node in O(1) instead of copying both strings
into a new flat array in O(n).

## Motivation

Benchmark #73 shows string concat is **6874x slower** than host-call and orders
of magnitude slower than JS. The root cause: every `a + b` allocates a new
`(array (mut i16))` of size `a.len + b.len` and copies both strings
character-by-character. In a loop concatenating 10k strings, this is O(n^2)
total work.

V8 uses ConsString — a binary tree node holding references to left and right
substrings. `a + b` is O(1): allocate a 2-pointer struct. The string is only
flattened to a contiguous array when needed (e.g., for indexOf or charAt).

## Design

### Rope node types

```
;; Flat string (existing, used for literals and flattened results)
FlatString = (struct (field $off i32) (field $len i32) (field $data (ref (array (mut i16)))))

;; Cons node (new, created by concatenation)
ConsString = (struct (field $len i32) (field $left (ref $String)) (field $right (ref $String)))

;; Union type — every string operation accepts either
String = FlatString | ConsString
```

In WasmGC, this requires either:
- **Option A: Tagged union** — A shared supertype struct with a tag field,
  and `ref.cast` to downcast.
- **Option B: i31ref tag** — Use `(ref eq)` as the string type, with
  runtime type checks via `ref.test`.

Option A is simpler and matches the WasmGC subtyping model:
```
$String     = (struct (field $tag i32) (field $len i32))
$FlatString = (sub $String (struct (field $tag i32) (field $len i32) (field $off i32) (field $data (ref $CharArray))))
$ConsString = (sub $String (struct (field $tag i32) (field $len i32) (field $left (ref $String)) (field $right (ref $String))))
```

### Concat operation

```wasm
;; a + b → ConsString in O(1)
(struct.new $ConsString
  (i32.const 1)                    ;; tag = CONS
  (i32.add                         ;; len = a.len + b.len
    (struct.get $String $len (local.get $a))
    (struct.get $String $len (local.get $b)))
  (local.get $a)                   ;; left
  (local.get $b))                  ;; right
```

### Flattening

Operations that need contiguous access (indexOf, charAt, substring, etc.)
flatten the rope first:

```
flatten(s):
  if s is FlatString → return s
  if s is ConsString →
    buf = new array[s.len]
    copy_tree(s, buf, 0)
    return FlatString(0, s.len, buf)

copy_tree(node, buf, pos):
  if node is FlatString → array.copy(buf, pos, node.data, node.off, node.len)
  if node is ConsString →
    copy_tree(node.left, buf, pos)
    copy_tree(node.right, buf, pos + node.left.len)
```

### Flatten-on-demand optimization

- `s.length` → O(1), reads `$len` field from either type (shared supertype)
- `a + b` → O(1), creates ConsString
- `s.indexOf(...)` → flatten first, then search (amortized: first call is O(n), subsequent are O(1) if cached)
- `s.charAt(i)` → can walk the tree in O(log n) without flattening, or flatten

### Flatten caching

After flattening, replace the ConsString's children with the flat result
(V8 does this — "migrating" a ConsString to a flat string). In WasmGC, struct
fields are immutable once set, so instead:
- Store the flattened result in a mutable `$flat` field on ConsString
- Check `$flat` before re-flattening

Or simpler: accept that flattening happens once per method call on the result.
For the common pattern `s = s + chunk` in a loop followed by one `s.indexOf()`,
this is O(n) total — same as the optimal case.

### Small-string threshold

For very short concatenations (e.g., `"a" + "b"`), the cons node overhead
(3 struct fields) exceeds the copy cost. Use a threshold: if `a.len + b.len < 64`,
copy into a flat string directly.

## Impact on existing code

- **String type resolution** — `resolveWasmType` for `string` must return
  `(ref $String)` instead of `(ref $NativeString)`
- **All string helpers** — Must accept `(ref $String)`, flatten if needed
- **String literals** — Continue to be FlatString
- **concat helper** — Replace copy-based implementation with ConsString creation
- **coerceType** — May need to handle String ↔ FlatString ↔ ConsString casts

## Complexity

L — New struct types (String, ConsString), flatten helper, changes to all
string method emitters to accept the union type, threshold logic for small
strings. ~500 lines.

## Dependencies

| Issue | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **#71** | Native strings — this optimizes the #71 concat |
| **#75** | String views — FlatString gains offset field from #75 |
| **#73** | Benchmarks — measure the speedup |

## Expected benchmark impact

- **concat-short**: 5218x slower → ~1x (O(1) cons nodes + one flatten)
- **concat-long**: 104058x slower → ~1x (same principle)
- **indexOf/includes**: small overhead from flatten check (negligible if already flat)
- **Other methods**: unchanged (flat strings behave identically)

## Non-goals

- Balanced rope trees (e.g., rebalancing deep trees) — V8 doesn't do this
  either; flatten is the escape hatch
- Mutable string builder (StringBuilder) — rope subsumes this use case
