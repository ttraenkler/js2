# #822 -- Wasm type mismatch compile errors (907 CE)

## Problem

907 tests fail with WebAssembly.instantiate type mismatch errors. The compiled Wasm module has type errors that V8 rejects at instantiation time. This is the largest compile error category.

## Sub-pattern breakdown

| Sub-pattern | Count | Root cause |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| local.tee expected (ref T), found struct.new (ref T) | 83 | Struct subtyping: struct.new returns exact type but local expects nullable |
| array.get expected (ref T), found extern.convert_any externref | 81 | Missing externref-to-ref coercion after array.get on externref arrays |
| call expected externref, found f64 | 64 | Missing f64-to-externref boxing at call sites |
| array.set expected f64, found array.get externref | 57 | Generator yield-star: reads externref array, writes f64 array without unbox |
| struct.new expected (ref T), found if f64 | 56 | Conditional expressions return wrong ref type for struct fields |
| struct.new expected f64, found local.get (ref T) | 50 | Closure captures: ref-cell local used where f64 expected |
| struct.get expected (ref T), found local.get (ref T) | 35 | Wrong struct type index in local variable |
| call expected (ref T), found extern.convert_any externref | 34 | Passing externref where specific ref type expected |
| not enough args for struct.new (need 3, got 2) | 27 | Missing field value in struct construction |
| local.tee expected (ref T), found local.get (ref T) | 25 | Local type mismatch in tee operations |
| call expected externref, found local.get f64 | 22 | Missing f64-to-externref boxing |
| call_ref expected (ref T), found array.get externref | 19 | Indirect call type mismatch |
| Other patterns | ~354 | Various type mismatches |

## Sample files with exact errors

**Error**: `WebAssembly.instantiate(): Compiling function #8:"test" failed: struct.get[0] expected type (ref null 8), found local.get of type (ref null 9) @+1021`
**Source line**: Object destructuring with escaped property name `{ d\u{65}fault: x }`

## Root cause

Multiple codegen paths in `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` and `src/codegen/expressions.ts` fail to insert correct type coercions:

1. **Missing unbox**: externref values from array.get need `__unbox_number` before use as f64
2. **Missing box**: f64 values need `__box_number` before passing as externref args
3. **Wrong struct type**: Struct field access uses wrong type index when multiple struct types exist
4. **Incomplete struct.new**: Nested destructuring defaults produce too few arguments for struct.new

## Acceptance criteria

- 907 type mismatch compile errors eliminated
- All sub-patterns addressed with correct coercions

## Suspended Work
- **Worktree**: /workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-822-type-mismatch
- **Branch**: issue-822-type-mismatch
- **Done**: 4 commits — member inc/dec coercion, static method funcIdx lookup, if-expression call arg coercion (+ revert of one approach)
- **Remaining**: stack-balance.ts fixCallArgTypesInBody — extending to handle valued if/block expressions that produce a value needing coercion. The uncommitted change walks into if/block to insert coercions on their produced values.
- **Files modified (uncommitted)**: stack-balance.ts (+44 lines: valued if/block handling in fixCallArgTypesInBody)
- **Resume**: Continue from fixCallArgTypesInBody in stack-balance.ts line ~1224. The if/block valued expression handler is partially written — needs the coercion insertion logic completed and testing against the 81 array.get externref pattern tests.

## Sprint-31 Regression Warning

**Work Items A and C**: Safe, net positive. Keep.
**Work Item B** (ref↔ref coercion in callArgCoercionInstrs): Net positive (+900 tests) but adds ref.cast_null that can cause runtime traps. Must run full test262 to verify.
**Work Items C and D**: No-ops (architect spec was wrong about these).

**KEY RULE**: After merging each work item, run full test262 and compare to previous pass count. Do not stack multiple work items without testing between them.

## Implementation Plan

### Why the reverted fix failed

The reverted commit (45fbc88a) added "repair passes" in `repairBody` and expanded `callArgCoercionInstrs` to insert `ref.cast_null` between arbitrary ref types and widened the "safe coercion" set in `fixCallArgTypesInBody`. The problem: repair passes operate on the instruction stream *after* codegen, without full stack simulation context. They guess which instruction produced the operand for a given consumer by walking backwards, but that heuristic breaks for compound expressions (if/block/loop producing values). The widened safe-coercion set allowed coercions in sub-expression positions where the backward walk had already lost track of which argument it was fixing, causing *more* type mismatches than it repaired (+6K CE net).

### Strategy: fix root causes at codegen time, not via post-hoc repair

Each work item below is independent, net-positive, and revertible.

---

### Work Item 1: `return_call` not enough arguments (52 CE)

**Root cause**: `compileReturnStatement` (statements.ts:2986-2991) converts `call` to `return_call` if `canTailCall` passes, but `canTailCall` only checks return-type match. It does NOT verify that the stack contains exactly the callee's parameter count of values. When the caller has additional locals/values on the stack frame (e.g., from try/catch cleanup, closure setup), `return_call` consumes them incorrectly, or there aren't enough.

**Fix**: In `canTailCall` (statements.ts:2835), add a parameter-count check: the callee's param count must equal the number of values the `call` instruction was set up with. Since `call` always has the right number of args pushed before it, the real issue is that `return_call` also implicitly pops the *entire* remaining stack as args. The safe fix is more conservative: only allow tail call when the callee has the *same signature* as the caller (same params AND same results), not just matching results.

**File**: `src/codegen/statements.ts`
- Function `canTailCall` (line ~2835): change the check to compare full function signatures (param count + types), not just return type.
- Alternatively, the simplest safe fix: compare `calleeType.params.length === callerType.params.length` in addition to the existing return type check.

### Work Item 2: `local.tee` type mismatch with `__closure` (18 CE)

**Root cause**: When a closure captures variables, the closure struct type index can differ from the local's declared type index after `addUnionImports` shifts type indices. The local is declared with one struct type but the `local.tee` receives a `struct.new` of a different (shifted) type.

**File**: `src/codegen/stack-balance.ts`
- Function `callArgCoercionInstrs` (line ~1174): the existing code returns `[]` when both sides are ref/ref_null with the same typeIdx but does nothing when typeIdx differs. Add: when `actual.kind` and `expected.kind` are both ref/ref_null and typeIdx differs, return `[{ op: "ref.cast_null", typeIdx: expectedIdx }]`.
- This is exactly what the reverted fix did, BUT only apply it in the `fixCallArgTypesInBody` call-argument context (not in the sub-expression context). The reverted fix failed because it also added this to the widened `isSafeCoercion` set for sub-expressions.
- Keep the existing `inSubExpr` guard: do NOT add `ref.cast_null` to the safe-in-sub-expression list.

---

### Work Item 3: `__vec_get extern.convert_any expected` (22 CE)

**Root cause**: `emitVecHelpers` (index.ts:~1404) builds the `__vec_get` function body. For element types that are GC refs (not externref, not f64, not i32), it emits `extern.convert_any` to box the `array.get` result to externref. But when the array element type is itself a struct/ref type, `array.get` returns `(ref null T)` which is an anyref subtype -- `extern.convert_any` is correct here. The actual CE is that `fixupExternConvertAny` (index.ts:11921) later *removes* the `extern.convert_any` because it sees it follows a `ref.cast` and thinks it's redundant.

**File**: `src/codegen/index.ts`
- Function `fixupExternConvertAny` (line ~11991): the check for `ref.cast`/`ref.cast_null` preceding `extern.convert_any` incorrectly sets `isFuncref = true` when the cast target is a func type. But it should NOT remove `extern.convert_any` after `array.get` -- `array.get` of a ref-typed array produces anyref, and `extern.convert_any` is needed to return externref from `__vec_get`.
- Fix: skip the removal when the `extern.convert_any` is inside `__vec_get` (check function name), OR more robustly, only remove `extern.convert_any` when the preceding instruction provably already produces externref (not anyref/ref).

### Work Item 4: `struct.new expected type mismatch` (17 CE)

**Root cause**: Already partially addressed by `fixStructNewFieldCoercion` (stack-balance.ts:1682). The remaining 17 cases likely involve if-expressions or block-expressions producing a value that becomes a struct.new field -- the forward type-stack simulation in `fixStructNewFieldCoercion` pushes `null` (unknown) for if/block results, so it can't detect the mismatch.

**File**: `src/codegen/stack-balance.ts`
- Function `updateTypeStack` (line ~1810): for `if` and `block` instructions with a non-empty blockType, infer the result type from the blockType and push it onto the type stack instead of `null`. This gives `fixStructNewFieldCoercion` the type information it needs.

---

### Work Items NOT recommended (deferred)

- **call[0] expected type mismatch (23 CE)**: These are test harness function signature mismatches, not compiler bugs. The test function `$assert` receives wrong argument types from the test framework integration. Requires test262 runner changes, not codegen fixes.
- **ref-to-ref coercion in sub-expressions**: The reverted fix's biggest failure was widening the safe coercion set. Do not attempt until Work Items 1-4 are validated independently.

### Edge cases
- Work Item 1: constructors that call super() -- `return_call` must never be used for super calls (different param count)
- Work Item 2: `ref.cast_null` can trap at runtime if the types are truly incompatible (not just shifted). Only safe when the mismatch is from index shifting, not semantic differences. Mitigation: V8 validates at compile time, so a wrong cast will CE instead of silently trapping.
- Work Item 3: must not remove `extern.convert_any` that legitimately converts anyref to externref for function return values

### Test strategy
- Each work item gets its own branch and test262 run
- Compare CE count: must be net decrease with zero new FAILs
- Run equivalence tests between each merge

## Previous Work (Sprint 31)
- **Work Item A branch**: `issue-822-work-item-a` (commit d11fa244) — SAFE, cherry-pick directly
- **Work Item B branch**: `issue-822-ref-coercion` (commit 1042102c) — net positive but needs full test262 verification
- **Work Item C branch**: `issue-822-work-item-c` (commit b86dd2bf) — SAFE, cherry-pick directly
- **Work Item D**: No-op (architect spec was wrong)
- **Reuse**: Cherry-pick A and C first (safe), then B with test262 verification.
