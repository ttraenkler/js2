# #332 -- Export declaration at top level errors

## Status: done

17 test262 tests fail with export declaration errors. These are FIXTURE files (helper modules) that contain export statements, which the test runner tries to compile as standalone modules.

## Error pattern
- export declaration at top level

## Likely causes
- FIXTURE files should be skipped or handled differently by the test runner
- These are not standalone test files but helper modules imported by actual tests

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Reduce test262 failures matching this error pattern

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
1. **Compiler fix**: Added handling for `ExportDeclaration` and `ExportAssignment` in `compileStatementInner` (`src/codegen/statements.ts`). Previously these statement types fell through to the "Unsupported statement" error.
   - `ExportDeclaration` (`export { x }`, `export * from '...'`) is treated as a no-op since it has no runtime effect
   - `ExportAssignment` (`export default expr`) evaluates the expression for side effects and drops the result
2. **FIXTURE files**: Already filtered out by `findTestFiles` in `tests/test262-runner.ts` (line 1778) which excludes filenames containing `_FIXTURE`
3. **Test**: Added `tests/export-declarations.test.ts` with 6 tests covering export default, named exports, export function, and export const

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- handle ExportDeclaration and ExportAssignment in compileStatementInner
- `tests/export-declarations.test.ts` -- new test file with 6 passing tests

### Tests now passing
- All 6 new export declaration tests pass
