# #1177 — TDZ propagation through closure captures

## Problem

When a closure (arrow function, function expression, or transitively-capturing nested call) reads a `let`/`const`/`using` variable that is still in its **Temporal Dead Zone** at invocation time, ECMA-262 §9.1.1.1.1 (GetBindingValue, step 2: _if uninitialized, throw a ReferenceError_) requires a `ReferenceError` throw. The compiler's closure capture machinery currently captures the variable's **value** at struct-construction time but does **not** propagate the TDZ flag, so:

1. The closure body has no way to detect that the source binding is uninitialized.
2. The required `ReferenceError` never fires; instead the closure silently returns the variable's default (`null`/`0`/`NaN`) — or, worse, returns whatever garbage happened to live at the stale outer-local index.

This bug is structurally tied to **#1016c**. PR #30 commit `a554479f1` corrected the call-site capture-index lookup in `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` (replacing `cap.outerLocalIdx` with `fctx.localMap.get(cap.name) ?? cap.outerLocalIdx` so transitively-capturing closures forward the _right_ local). That fix exposed ~70 test262 regressions concentrated in:

- `language/statements/for-await-of/async-{func,gen}-decl-dstr-*.js` (~30 tests) — TDZ on the iterated `let x;` capture
- `language/statements/using/{block,function}-local-closure-get-before-initialization.js`
- `language/statements/await-using/function-local-closure-get-before-initialization.js`
- `language/statements/class/elements/*` — closures referencing TDZ-state instance fields

The reverted patch (`37d40dae7`) restores the stale-index read, which is technically wrong but happens to throw on downstream coercion/property access for some shapes — masking the spec violation. The right fix is a **dedicated TDZ-through-closures pass**: re-apply the call-site correction _and_ propagate the TDZ flag through every closure that captures a TDZ-tracked binding.

### Canonical reproductions

**`block-local-closure-get-before-initialization.js`**:

```js
{
  function f() {
    return x + 1;
  }
  assert.throws(ReferenceError, function () {
    f();
  });
  using x = null;
}
```

`f` is hoisted and captures `x` as a leading param. The arrow `function() { f(); }` transitively captures `x` (via `nestedFuncCaptures`-driven walk in `closures.ts:967-974`). When the arrow is invoked, `x` is still in TDZ, so the call site inside the lifted arrow body must `throw new ReferenceError("x is not defined")` before invoking `f`.

**`for-await-of` async-decl-dstr** (representative):

```js
let x;
async function fn() {
  for await ({ y: x = 1 } of [{ y: null }]) {
    assert.sameValue(x, null);
  }
}
fn();
```

The async function `fn` is lifted into a generator-style closure. The for-await body assigns into `x` (declared in the surrounding module scope). Inside the closure, the assignment is compiled through the destructure default path, which reads the captured value of `x`. The assignment-target write needs to flow back to the outer `x`, which requires `x` to be **boxed** through the closure (already true if `writtenInOuter` detects the assignment) AND the TDZ flag must be `1` so the write doesn't false-trip a TDZ check on the read of `x` for the destructure.

## ECMAScript spec reference

- §8.2.4 [InitializeBinding](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-initializebinding) — sets the binding's `[[InitializationStatus]]` to `initialized`
- §9.1.1.1.1 [GetBindingValue (DeclarativeEnvironment)](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-declarative-environment-records-getbindingvalue-n-s) — step 2: _if `[[InitializationStatus]]` is `uninitialized`, throw ReferenceError_
- §13.3.1 [Let and Const Declarations](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-let-and-const-declarations) — instantiation creates uninitialized bindings; the declaration evaluation is what initializes them
- §14.3 (`using` declarations, explicit-resource-management proposal) — same TDZ semantics apply pre-`using x = ...`

## Root cause

`fctx.tdzFlagLocals: Map<string, number>` stores an i32 local index per let/const that holds the TDZ flag (0 = uninitialized, 1 = initialized). The flag is read by `emitLocalTdzCheck` and written by `emitLocalTdzInit` (`src/codegen/statements/tdz.ts`).

Today, when a closure captures a name that has a TDZ flag in the outer fctx:

1. The flag is **not** part of the closure struct fields. The lifted body has no flag local; `liftedFctx.tdzFlagLocals` doesn't contain the captured name.
2. `compileIdentifier` (`src/codegen/expressions/identifiers.ts:319`) only emits a TDZ check when `fctx.tdzFlagLocals?.get(name)` is truthy. Inside the lifted body it isn't, so reads silently return the default value.
3. The pre-call TDZ check in `compileCallExpression` (`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts:4992-5001`) similarly only fires when the _current_ fctx has the flag. Inside a transitively-capturing arrow, the current fctx is the lifted body which has no flag.

Even if we _did_ register a flag local in the lifted body, capturing the flag as an i32 by value would freeze the flag at struct-construction time:

```js
let g = function () {
  return x;
}; // construct g; flag = 0
let x = 42; // flag = 1, BUT g's captured flag is still 0 → false positive
g(); // wrongly throws ReferenceError
```

So the flag must be captured **by reference** — boxed in an `i32` ref cell whose mutation in the outer fctx is visible to the closure.

The same staleness applies to the **value**: `let x = 42; let g = () => x; ` works today because `g` is constructed _after_ the let-init. For TDZ-captured cases (`g` constructed before `x = 42`), the captured value is also stale. To make `g()` after init return the post-init value, the captured **value** must also flow through a ref cell — i.e., we must treat any TDZ-flagged capture as mutable for boxing purposes.

## Implementation Plan

### Strategy

Add the TDZ flag to the existing closure-capture infrastructure as a **boxed-by-reference** parallel field. Reuse the existing `getOrRegisterRefCellType({kind:"i32"})` (registers `struct __ref_cell_i32 { mut value: i32 }`). Centralise flag set/get through `emitLocalTdzInit` / `emitLocalTdzCheck` so a single boxed-flag detection point keeps every existing call site correct.

Concurrently, force-box the **value** of any TDZ-flagged capture so the closure observes post-init mutations.

### Changes — files & functions

#### A. Re-apply the calls.ts capture-index correction (Stage 1)

**File:** `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`

Function `compileCallExpression`, the "Prepend captured values for nested functions with captures" loop (line ~4947–5012). Replace both `local.get cap.outerLocalIdx` sites with the localMap-first lookup that was in commit `a554479f1` and reverted in `37d40dae7`:

- Line ~4964 (mutable-capture branch, fresh-box path):
  ```ts
  const sourceLocalIdx = fctx.localMap.get(cap.name) ?? cap.outerLocalIdx;
  fctx.body.push({ op: "local.get", index: sourceLocalIdx });
  ```
- Line ~5002 (non-mutable branch):
  ```ts
  const sourceLocalIdx = fctx.localMap.get(cap.name) ?? cap.outerLocalIdx;
  fctx.body.push({ op: "local.get", index: sourceLocalIdx });
  // ...also use sourceLocalIdx in the getLocalType() call below.
  ```

Without Stage 1, transitively-capturing arrows pass `__self_cast` (or whichever local lives at the outer-fctx index) instead of the captured value. Stage 2 below relies on the captured value being correct.

Mirror the same change at the two `cap.outerLocalIdx` sites in the closure-emit path:

**File:** `src/codegen/closures.ts`

- Line ~2339 (in `emitFuncRefAsClosure` mutable-capture branch — fresh ref-cell allocation)
- Line ~2351 (non-mutable branch)

Replace with `fctx.localMap.get(cap.name) ?? cap.outerLocalIdx`. Same rationale; this path emits when a nested function declaration is wrapped as a closure and pushed onto the stack (e.g., assigned to a variable or passed as a callback).

There is one further site at `src/codegen/string-ops.ts:394` (`tagged template processing`). Audit it for the same pattern; apply if it emits captures from a transitively-capturing context.

#### B. Box the TDZ flag in an i32 ref cell on first capture (Stage 2)

**File:** `src/codegen/context/types.ts` (FunctionContext)

Add a sibling field next to `boxedCaptures`:

```ts
/**
 * For TDZ flag locals that have been boxed in an i32 ref cell so that
 * mutations propagate to closures that captured the flag. Each entry
 * records the local index of the ref cell ref and its struct type idx.
 *
 * Once a name is in this map, ALL set/get of its TDZ flag must go
 * through struct.get/struct.set on the ref cell — emitLocalTdzCheck and
 * emitLocalTdzInit must check this map before falling back to local i32 access.
 */
boxedTdzFlags?: Map<string, { refCellTypeIdx: number; localIdx: number }>;
```

`fctx.tdzFlagLocals[name]` continues to point at _some_ local index — but when the entry is also in `boxedTdzFlags`, that local holds a `ref __ref_cell_i32` instead of the raw i32. Helpers route through the ref cell.

**File:** `src/codegen/statements/tdz.ts`

Update both helpers to detect boxed flags. **Same i32 ref cell type** is reused for every flag (the cell's value type is `i32`).

```ts
// emitLocalTdzInit — set the flag to 1
export function emitLocalTdzInit(fctx: FunctionContext, name: string): void {
  const flagIdx = fctx.tdzFlagLocals?.get(name);
  if (flagIdx === undefined) return;
  const boxed = fctx.boxedTdzFlags?.get(name);
  if (boxed) {
    fctx.body.push({ op: "local.get", index: boxed.localIdx });
    fctx.body.push({ op: "i32.const", value: 1 });
    fctx.body.push({ op: "struct.set", typeIdx: boxed.refCellTypeIdx, fieldIdx: 0 });
  } else {
    fctx.body.push({ op: "i32.const", value: 1 });
    fctx.body.push({ op: "local.set", index: flagIdx });
  }
}
```

```ts
// emitLocalTdzCheck — read flag, throw if 0
export function emitLocalTdzCheck(ctx, fctx, name, flagIdx): void {
  // ... existing late-import setup ...
  const boxed = fctx.boxedTdzFlags?.get(name);
  if (boxed) {
    fctx.body.push({ op: "local.get", index: boxed.localIdx });
    fctx.body.push({ op: "struct.get", typeIdx: boxed.refCellTypeIdx, fieldIdx: 0 });
  } else {
    fctx.body.push({ op: "local.get", index: flagIdx });
  }
  fctx.body.push({ op: "i32.eqz" });
  // ... existing `if` + throw ...
}
```

`emitLocalTdzCheck` is in `src/codegen/expressions/identifiers.ts:24`; `emitLocalTdzInit` is in `src/codegen/statements/tdz.ts:28`. Apply the boxed-flag branch in both.

**Audit existing direct flag manipulations** before merging — every site that does `local.set/local.get` on a TDZ flag local must route through the helpers (or through a parallel `boxedTdzFlags` check). The known direct-set sites are all parameter TDZ flags inside lifted functions (closures.ts:651-652, 705-706, 752-753, 799-800), which are local to the lifted scope and **never captured** — they remain unboxed. Verify by `grep -n "tdzFlags\[" src/codegen/closures.ts` after changes; no new direct-set should leak.

#### C. Promote-on-capture (Stage 3) — the actual capture site

Two functions need this: `compileArrowAsClosure` (arrow / function expression) and the captures branch of `compileNestedFunctionDeclaration` (function declaration with captures uses leading-param passing instead of struct).

##### C.1 `compileArrowAsClosure` (`src/codegen/closures.ts`)

The relevant section is **line ~1058–1268** (capture analysis, struct field construction, lifted body prologue).

**Step C.1.a — force-box value when flag is present (line ~1073):**

```ts
const isMutable = writtenInClosure.has(name) || writtenInOuter.has(name) || fctx.tdzFlagLocals?.has(name); // ← NEW
```

This makes the captured value flow through a ref cell so post-init mutations are visible. (Without this, `let x = 42` _after_ a closure construction would still leave the closure observing `0`/`null`/`NaN`.)

**Step C.1.b — register a `boxedTdzFlags` entry on first flag capture (around line ~1080):**

After computing `captures: { name, type, localIdx, mutable, alreadyBoxed }[]`, **before** building struct fields:

```ts
// For each capture that has a TDZ flag in the outer fctx, ensure the flag
// is boxed in an i32 ref cell so subsequent set/get propagates across the
// closure boundary.
const i32RefCellTypeIdx = ((): number | undefined => {
  let needAny = false;
  for (const cap of captures) {
    if (fctx.tdzFlagLocals?.has(cap.name)) {
      needAny = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  return needAny ? getOrRegisterRefCellType(ctx, { kind: "i32" }) : undefined;
})();

if (i32RefCellTypeIdx !== undefined) {
  if (!fctx.boxedTdzFlags) fctx.boxedTdzFlags = new Map();
  for (const cap of captures) {
    if (!fctx.tdzFlagLocals?.has(cap.name)) continue;
    if (fctx.boxedTdzFlags.has(cap.name)) continue; // already boxed by an enclosing closure
    const oldFlagIdx = fctx.tdzFlagLocals.get(cap.name)!;
    // Allocate ref cell, init from current flag value, store ref in a new local.
    fctx.body.push({ op: "local.get", index: oldFlagIdx });
    fctx.body.push({ op: "struct.new", typeIdx: i32RefCellTypeIdx });
    const boxedLocal = allocLocal(fctx, `__tdz_box_${cap.name}`, { kind: "ref", typeIdx: i32RefCellTypeIdx });
    fctx.body.push({ op: "local.set", index: boxedLocal });
    fctx.boxedTdzFlags.set(cap.name, { refCellTypeIdx: i32RefCellTypeIdx, localIdx: boxedLocal });
    // Re-aim the flag entry at the boxed local so downstream
    // emitLocalTdzInit / emitLocalTdzCheck use the ref-cell path.
    fctx.tdzFlagLocals.set(cap.name, boxedLocal);
  }
}
```

**Step C.1.c — add the flag ref cell as an additional struct field (around line ~1112-1138):**

For each capture with a TDZ flag, add a parallel `__tdz_<name>` field of type `{kind:"ref", typeIdx: i32RefCellTypeIdx}` to the struct. Place it _after_ the value field for that capture. Track the field indices so the prologue can pull them out. The simplest layout:

```
field 0 = funcref
field 1 = cap0_value  (boxed, ref __ref_cell_T)
field 2 = cap0_tdzflag (ref __ref_cell_i32) — only if cap0 has a TDZ flag
field 3 = cap1_value
field 4 = cap1_tdzflag                       — only if cap1 has a TDZ flag
...
```

Either build the field list in two arrays and zip them, or attach a parallel `tdzFieldIdx?: number` per capture. Whichever is less surgery against the existing `structFields.map` block.

**Step C.1.d — at construction-time emit (line ~1080 area, the struct.new push):**

For each capture, after pushing the value (existing code), also push the boxed flag ref:

```ts
if (fctx.boxedTdzFlags?.has(cap.name)) {
  const { localIdx: flagBoxLocal } = fctx.boxedTdzFlags.get(cap.name)!;
  fctx.body.push({ op: "local.get", index: flagBoxLocal });
}
```

(The `i32RefCellTypeIdx` is the same shared type for every flag — no per-name registration.)

**Step C.1.e — in the lifted body prologue (line ~1222–1268):**

After pulling the value field into `liftedFctx`'s local (existing loop), if the capture has a TDZ flag, also pull the flag ref cell into a local and register both maps:

```ts
if (fctx.tdzFlagLocals?.has(cap.name)) {
  // The struct field is the i32 ref cell ref.
  const flagRefCellTypeIdx = getOrRegisterRefCellType(ctx, { kind: "i32" });
  const flagBoxLocal = allocLocal(liftedFctx, `__tdz_box_${cap.name}`,
    { kind: "ref", typeIdx: flagRefCellTypeIdx });
  liftedFctx.body.push({ op: "local.get", index: selfLocalForCaptures });
  liftedFctx.body.push({ op: "struct.get", typeIdx: structTypeIdx, fieldIdx: <tdzFieldIdx> });
  liftedFctx.body.push({ op: "local.set", index: flagBoxLocal });
  if (!liftedFctx.boxedTdzFlags) liftedFctx.boxedTdzFlags = new Map();
  liftedFctx.boxedTdzFlags.set(cap.name, { refCellTypeIdx: flagRefCellTypeIdx, localIdx: flagBoxLocal });
  if (!liftedFctx.tdzFlagLocals) liftedFctx.tdzFlagLocals = new Map();
  liftedFctx.tdzFlagLocals.set(cap.name, flagBoxLocal);
}
```

`tdzFlagLocals.set(name, flagBoxLocal)` is what makes existing `compileIdentifier` and `compileCallExpression` (calls.ts:4992) automatically emit the TDZ check inside the lifted body — they don't need to know the flag is boxed; they just call the helpers, which detect `boxedTdzFlags` and route through the ref cell.

##### C.2 `compileNestedFunctionDeclaration` (`src/codegen/statements/nested-declarations.ts`)

A function-declaration callee (e.g. `function f() { return x + 1; }`) does NOT use a struct. Captures are forwarded as **leading parameters at every call site** (calls.ts:4947–5012). The lifted body reads them as ordinary params. So:

- The TDZ check **at the call site** in calls.ts (line 4992-5001) already handles this — provided the _caller's_ fctx has `tdzFlagLocals[cap.name]`. In the existing test failure, the caller is a _transitively-capturing arrow body_. After Step C.1 wires `liftedFctx.tdzFlagLocals` for arrow bodies, the call to `f` from inside the arrow correctly emits the TDZ check.
- The lifted body of `f` itself does NOT need a TDZ flag — because the caller has already validated the binding. `f`'s body just reads its leading param like any other parameter.
- **Exception:** if `f` calls _another_ nested function that captures the same TDZ-flagged name, `f` must forward the TDZ check transitively. Handle this by giving `f` its own TDZ flag local seeded from a new leading "flag" param, only when `nestedFuncCaptures.get(f.name)` indicates `f` calls something that requires the flag.

For Stage 2 v1, defer the cross-function-declaration transitive case (it's rare; the common test262 patterns are arrow-wraps-fn-decl which Step C.1 covers). Note as a follow-up.

**Force-box the value in the no-capture-struct branch:**
At `nested-declarations.ts:204`:

```ts
const isMutable = writtenInBody.has(name) || fctx.tdzFlagLocals?.has(name); // ← NEW
```

If `f` is _itself_ a transitive arrow-style capture (i.e., `f` captures the boxed value), the existing ref-cell path applies and the destructure-default fix continues to land correctly.

#### D. Update the `nestedFuncCaptures` record so transitively-capturing arrows know to forward the flag

**File:** `src/codegen/context/types.ts`

Extend the `nestedFuncCaptures` value entry:

```ts
nestedFuncCaptures: Map<
  string,
  {
    name: string;
    outerLocalIdx: number;
    mutable?: boolean;
    valType?: ValType;
    hasTdzFlag?: boolean; // ← NEW: callee inherits a TDZ-tracked binding
  }[]
>;
```

In `nested-declarations.ts:524-532`, set `hasTdzFlag: fctx.tdzFlagLocals?.has(c.name) ?? false`.

In `closures.ts:967-974` (the transitive-capture loop), when adding a name to `referencedNames` because `f` captures it, ALSO ensure that the closure's analysis sees the TDZ-flag requirement (it already does since `fctx.tdzFlagLocals` will still contain the entry — this is fine).

In `calls.ts:4992-5001`, no change needed: the call-site TDZ check already runs unconditionally based on `fctx.tdzFlagLocals?.get(cap.name)`, which inside the lifted arrow body is now populated by Step C.1.e.

### Wasm IR — the boxed flag pattern

Boxing the flag at first capture (in the outer fctx, at the closure construction point):

```wasm
;; current value of __tdz_x (i32) into a fresh ref cell
local.get  $__tdz_x          ;; the unboxed i32 flag
struct.new $__ref_cell_i32   ;; struct { mut value: i32 }
local.set  $__tdz_box_x      ;; ref __ref_cell_i32

;; then push struct fields for closure construction:
local.get  $x_value_box      ;; ref __ref_cell_T (existing path — value box)
local.get  $__tdz_box_x      ;; ref __ref_cell_i32 (NEW — flag box)
;; ...other captures...
struct.new $closure_struct_X
```

Set the flag (`emitLocalTdzInit` after `let x = ...` runs):

```wasm
local.get   $__tdz_box_x
i32.const   1
struct.set  $__ref_cell_i32 0
```

Read the flag (`emitLocalTdzCheck` before identifier read or capture-pass):

```wasm
local.get   $__tdz_box_x
struct.get  $__ref_cell_i32 0
i32.eqz
if
  global.get  $__strconst_x_is_not_defined
  call        $__throw_reference_error
  unreachable
end
```

Inside the lifted closure body — same shape as outer; the `$__tdz_box_x` local is loaded from the closure struct in the prologue.

### Edge cases

1. **Captures of a name that's already boxed by an enclosing closure** (`alreadyBoxed = true` in the captures list). The flag is already in the enclosing `boxedTdzFlags`; just propagate the existing ref-cell ref forward. Don't re-box.
2. **Closure inside a loop** that wraps the let declaration. The loop creates a new TDZ-flag local each iteration (per-iteration scope). The boxing happens per-iteration; each closure construction freshly captures the current iteration's flag. `analyzeTdzAccessByPos` returns `"check"` for the in-loop case so the runtime check stays — correct.
3. **Per-iteration `let` semantics in `for(let i=0;i<n;i++) closures.push(()=>i)`**. Existing per-iteration local copy in loops.ts:206–464 handles the value side. Our flag boxing is per-iteration too because `tdzFlagLocals` is reset at each loop entry.
4. **Async generator / await-using functions.** `async function fn(){ for await ({ y: x = 1 } of ...) {} }` — `x` is in module scope; `fn` is lifted. Force-boxing the value (Stage 2 step C.1.a) makes the for-await assignment write back through the ref cell. The flag boxing makes the read-before-write TDZ check correct.
5. **`emitFuncRefAsClosure` (closures.ts:2335-2353).** This emits when a nested function declaration is wrapped as a closure (passed as callback, assigned to a variable, etc.). Apply the same Step C.1 changes: force-box flag-tracked captures, push the boxed flag ref as an extra struct field. The trampoline body is plain (only forwards user params), so the flag never enters the trampoline — only the struct.
6. **Static TDZ analysis preserved.** `analyzeTdzAccessByPos` returning `"skip"` (call site is in same fctx and after declaration end) still elides the runtime check at call sites. `"throw"` still emits a static throw. Only `"check"` cases pay the ref-cell cost.
7. **Module-level `tdzGlobals` path is unchanged.** Top-level let/const variables already use a global TDZ flag (`ctx.tdzGlobals`) which is naturally by-reference. No struct boxing needed for module-level captures — `compileIdentifier` line 384-389 / 406-410 already handles them.
8. **Inline-elided TDZ flags (`elideTdzFlags`) — see `index.ts:6010+` `analyzeLetConstFlags`.** The pre-pass elides the flag entirely if no access can possibly be in TDZ. Closures referencing the variable already force `"check"` via `analyzeTdzAccess` cross-function path (identifiers.ts:73-87), so the flag is allocated when needed. No change required here.

### Test files to verify (test262)

Stage 1 (calls.ts re-apply) — local equiv tests:

- existing `tests/issue-1016.test.ts` parameter-default closure-capture cases continue to pass
- new equiv test: an arrow that calls a transitively-captured nested function, where the captured value is a class instance (validates the localMap-first lookup avoids passing `__self_cast`)

Stage 2 (TDZ propagation) — test262:

- `language/statements/using/block-local-closure-get-before-initialization.js` — the canonical case
- `language/statements/using/function-local-closure-get-before-initialization.js`
- `language/statements/await-using/{block,function}-local-closure-get-before-initialization.js`
- `language/statements/using/global-closure-get-before-initialization.js` — module-level (should already pass via tdzGlobals; verify)
- `language/statements/for-await-of/async-func-decl-dstr-{obj,array}-*-init-*.js` (~30 tests) — TDZ on for-await iteration target
- `language/statements/for-await-of/async-gen-decl-dstr-*` (~30 tests)
- `language/statements/class/elements/*get-before-initialization*` if any (instance-field TDZ closures)

Stage 1+2 net: must ≥ recover the +24 net pass from `a554479f1` AND retire the -70 regression cluster, for a target of net ≈ +90 vs. current main.

### Out-of-scope

- Cross-function-declaration transitive TDZ forwarding (function `f` calling function `g` where `g` captures a TDZ-flagged binding _not_ in `f`'s caller frame). Common arrow-wrap pattern is covered; nested fn-decl chains are deferred. Add a follow-up issue if test262 surfaces a cluster.
- Promoting captured TDZ-flagged let/const to globals (an alternative architecture). Rejected: requires a parallel modification of `compileVariableStatement` to handle a `capturedGlobals` write path, and changes the dispatch behavior for the let-init statement. The boxed-flag approach is more localised.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `tests/issue-1016.test.ts` continues to pass; no equivalence-test regressions.
2. CI (sharded test262, full run via PR) shows:
   - **Net +20 or better** vs `main` HEAD at PR open
   - The `for-await-of/async-{func,gen}-decl-dstr-*` cluster: **−5 or fewer regressions**, **+25 or more improvements**
   - The `using/*-closure-get-before-initialization` cluster: **0 regressions**, **≥3 improvements** (block-local + function-local + await-using-function-local)
   - No single error-bucket grows by more than 30 regressions
3. Equivalence tests pass with no new failures (`npm test -- tests/equivalence.test.ts`).
4. Smoke run (`pnpm run test:262 --recheck`) on a 1000-test sample shows the `block-local-closure-get-before-initialization.js` test now PASSing (was FAIL on the reverted state).
5. Diff to `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` is exactly the lines reverted in `37d40dae7` (Stage 1 portion only — the impl plan adds new code in `closures.ts` and `tdz.ts` plus the new `boxedTdzFlags` field).

## Suggested implementation order

1. Stage 1: re-apply calls.ts + closures.ts capture-index correction (~10 lines). Run equivalence tests + smoke a few destructure-default test262 cases.
2. Add `boxedTdzFlags` field to `FunctionContext` and update `emitLocalTdzInit`/`emitLocalTdzCheck` helpers (Stage 2 step B). Local validation: existing behavior unchanged when `boxedTdzFlags` is empty.
3. Wire Stage 2 step C.1 (compileArrowAsClosure) — force-box value, allocate flag ref cell, add struct field, emit prologue. Smoke `block-local-closure-get-before-initialization.js` — should now throw ReferenceError.
4. Wire `emitFuncRefAsClosure` parallel path (closures.ts:2335-2353) for fn-decl→closure wrapping.
5. Audit grep `tdzFlags\[`, `tdzFlagLocals\.set`, and `local.set.*tdz` — ensure no direct-set leaks past the boxed-flag detection.
6. Run sharded CI; investigate any non-target regressions. Iterate.
