# #649 — Residual stack underflow (876 CE)

## Status: in-review
876 tests originally hit "not enough arguments on the stack". #627 fixed void RHS in &&/||/??. Remaining 13 CEs were dominated by type mismatch errors in wrapper constructor contexts.

### Root cause
`isStringType()` in `type-mapper.ts` only checked `ts.TypeFlags.String | StringLiteral`, missing the `String` wrapper object type (`new String("x")` has `ts.TypeFlags.Object` with symbol name "String"). This caused `compileBinaryExpression` to route `new String("1") + 1` through numeric addition instead of string concatenation, producing `f64.add` where `externref` (string) was needed.

### Fix
Enhanced `isStringType()` to also recognize `String` wrapper objects by checking `type.getSymbol()?.name === "String"` when `type.flags & ts.TypeFlags.Object`. Also added `isNumberWrapperType()` helper.

### Impact
- Fixes 11 of 13 remaining CEs (9 addition + 2 subtraction type mismatches)
- Remaining 2 CEs are BigInt literal tests (`1n + 1`) - separate issue domain

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Modified `isStringType()` in `src/checker/type-mapper.ts` to recognize String wrapper object types
- Added `isNumberWrapperType()` helper for future use
- Added 5 equivalence tests for wrapper type + operator patterns

### Files changed
- `src/checker/type-mapper.ts` - enhanced `isStringType`, added `isNumberWrapperType`
- `tests/equivalence/wrapper-string-concat.test.ts` - new test file

### What worked
- Single-function fix in the type checker layer resolved all wrapper-related type mismatches
- The codegen for `new String(x)` already correctly emits string (externref); only the type routing was wrong

### What didn't work
- BigInt tests remain as CEs due to separate issues with BigInt + null/undefined/boolean mixing

## Complexity: M
