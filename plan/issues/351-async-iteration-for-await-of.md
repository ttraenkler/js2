# Issue #351: Async iteration / for-await-of

## Problem
329 test262 tests tagged with `async-iteration` were being skipped. Since #339 made async functions compile by treating `await` as identity, `for await (const x of iterable)` can be compiled as a regular `for (const x of iterable)`.

## Changes
1. Removed `"async-iteration"` from `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES` in `tests/test262-runner.ts`
2. Added equivalence tests in `tests/equivalence/for-await-of.test.ts`

No codegen changes were needed -- the existing `ForOfStatement` handler in `statements.ts` already ignores the `awaitModifier` property and compiles the loop normally.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Removed the `async-iteration` skip filter from test262-runner.ts
- Added 4 equivalence tests covering for-await-of with arrays, let bindings, string iteration, and accumulation
- All tests pass, confirming that for-await-of compiles correctly as regular for-of

### What worked
- The existing ForOfStatement codegen already handles the await modifier transparently (it simply doesn't check for it)
- Since await is compiled as identity (#339), the async iteration semantics are preserved for synchronous iterables

### Files changed
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- removed `async-iteration` from UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES
- `tests/equivalence/for-await-of.test.ts` -- new equivalence test file (4 tests)
