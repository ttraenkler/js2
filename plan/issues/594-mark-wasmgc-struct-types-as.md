# Issue #594: Mark WasmGC struct types as final for V8 devirtualization

## Problem

In WasmGC, struct types that participate in subtyping hierarchies are currently always emitted as non-final (`sub` opcode 0x50). V8 can devirtualize `struct.get`/`struct.set` operations when it knows the struct type is final (no subtypes possible), enabling direct field access without type checks.

## Solution

Added a post-processing pass `markLeafStructsFinal()` that runs after codegen but before dead elimination. It identifies leaf struct types in subtype hierarchies and marks them as final (emitted with `sub_final` opcode 0x4F).

A struct type is marked final when:
1. It has `superTypeIdx` set (participates in subtyping), AND
2. No other struct type references it as its `superTypeIdx` (it's a leaf)

Types without `superTypeIdx` are already implicitly final in the Wasm spec encoding.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added optional `final` field to `StructTypeDef` in `src/ir/types.ts`
- Added `markLeafStructsFinal()` function in `src/codegen/index.ts` that scans all types to find which type indices are used as superTypeIdx, then marks unreferenced (leaf) types as final
- Updated `src/emit/binary.ts` to emit `sub_final` (0x4F) when `t.final` is true instead of always using `sub` (0x50)
- Updated `src/emit/wat.ts` to include `final` keyword in WAT text output for final subtypes
- Called `markLeafStructsFinal()` in both `generateModule()` and `generateMultiModule()`

### Files changed
- `src/ir/types.ts` -- added `final?: boolean` to StructTypeDef
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- added markLeafStructsFinal function and calls
- `src/emit/binary.ts` -- use sub_final when struct is marked final
- `src/emit/wat.ts` -- output `sub final` in WAT text

### What worked
- All inheritance, instanceof, and abstract class tests pass
- Verified in WAT output: leaf types like `$Dog` are `sub final`, parent types like `$Animal` remain `sub`
- Native string types correctly handled: `$NativeString` and `$ConsString` are `sub final`, `$AnyString` stays `sub`
- Dead elimination naturally preserves the `final` field via spread operator

### Tests passing
- tests/inheritance.test.ts (7/7)
- tests/instanceof.test.ts (7/7)
- tests/abstract-classes.test.ts (6/6)
- tests/simd.test.ts (23/23)
