## Problem

`Array.prototype.reduce.call(arrayLike, fn)` and similar patterns fail because array method implementations assumed a true Wasm vec receiver. Array-like objects (with `length` + numeric keys) must also be supported per spec.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `Array.prototype.reduce.call(arrayLike, fn)` works
- [x] `Array.prototype.map.call(arrayLike, fn)` works
- [x] test262 array-call tests pass

## Implementation

Merged via PR #223 (branch `issue-array-call-arraylike`).
