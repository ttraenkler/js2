# #1148 — Investigate skip:103 regression

## Problem

103 tests that were passing in the April 13 baseline (22,450 pass) are now being **skipped** by a filter added in `tests/test262-runner.ts` lines 252–270. The skip filter is:

```
/annexB\/language\/eval-code\/(direct|indirect)\/(func|global)-.*-eval-(func|global)-skip-early-err-/
```

Reason: "Annex B §B.3.3 early-error hoisting: requires direct-eval scope visibility, not observable through JS host eval (#1073 followup)"

## Sample skipped tests
- `test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/func-block-decl-eval-func-skip-early-err-block.js`
- `test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/func-block-decl-eval-func-skip-early-err-for-in.js`
- `test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/func-if-decl-else-decl-a-eval-func-skip-early-err-for-in.js`
(103 total matching `func-*-eval-func-skip-early-err-*` and `func-*-eval-global-skip-early-err-*`)

## Investigation needed

The code comment says these tests "passed as false positives on main (eval was a silent no-op)". This means:
- Before PR #1073, `eval()` was a no-op → tests passed trivially
- After #1073, eval actually runs → tests now fail (because we lack direct-eval scope injection)
- The skip was added to avoid CI noise

**Key question**: Can these 103 tests be made to pass now with our current eval implementation? Or are they genuinely requiring scope-injection that we don't have?

## Investigation steps

1. **Test locally**: Pick 3 representative tests from the skip list, remove them from the skip filter temporarily, compile and run:
   ```
   npx tsx tests/test262-runner.ts --file test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/func-block-decl-eval-func-skip-early-err-block.js
   ```
   What error do they produce?

2. **If they pass**: The skip is wrong — these tests don't need scope injection. Narrow the regex to exclude the passing subset.

3. **If they fail with a fixable error**: Fix the underlying issue and remove the skip.

4. **If they genuinely require scope injection**: Document this as WONT-FIX or create a follow-up issue for scope injection, and record the count (103) in the skip reason for tracking.

## What the tests check

`func-block-decl-eval-func-skip-early-err-block.js` tests:
```js
(function() {
  eval('assert.throws(ReferenceError, function() { f; }); ... { let f = 123; { function f() {} } } ...');
})();
```

The Annex B §B.3.3 extension says: when a function declaration inside a block would produce an early error (e.g., let binding in scope), the `var`-like hoisting does NOT happen. The test verifies `f` is not accessible outside the block.

## Acceptance criteria
- Either: Remove/narrow the skip filter and confirm these tests pass
- Or: Document as false-positives-now-correctly-skipped, close issue with explanation
- Run `npm test -- tests/equivalence.test.ts` — no regressions

## Key files
- `tests/test262-runner.ts:252-270` — the skip filter to investigate
- `test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/func-block-decl-eval-func-skip-early-err-*.js` — the 103 tests

## Test Results (2026-04-20)

Ran all **144** tests matched by the skip regex (`direct/` + `indirect/`, `func-*` + `global-*`), bypassing `shouldSkip`:

```
{ pass: 144, fail: 0, ce: 0, throw: 0 }
```

**The skip was wrong.** Every test the filter suppressed actually passes through our current JS-host eval. The rationale in the old comment ("assertions reference the enclosing function scope… only observable through direct eval") is incorrect for this family of tests: all the relevant assertions (`typeof f`, `assert.throws(ReferenceError, () => f)`) live *inside* the eval string, observing the eval's own scope — not the outer wasm frame's scope. Block-scoped `let f` and the suppressed Annex-B hoisting happen entirely inside the eval string. That's correctly modeled by `globalThis.eval` in the host. No direct-eval scope injection is needed for this particular behavior.

Previously-claimed "false positive on main (eval was a silent no-op)" was true for the CE case but no longer applies: `__extern_eval` actually runs the code now (#1073), the inside-the-eval assertions fire, and they pass.

**Decision:** remove the skip filter (lines 252–272 in `tests/test262-runner.ts`).
Expected CI delta: +144 pass, -144 skip.
