# Issue #564: Worker crashed -- 572 tests lost to worker process crashes

## Problem

572 tests in the test262 runner report as `compile_error` with `"worker crashed"` but
the error message gives no diagnostic information (exit code, signal, spawn error).
Additionally, the `error` event on the forked worker process was not handled, so if
a worker fails to spawn or encounters an IPC error, the promise could hang.

## Fix

In `scripts/run-test262.ts`, the `runBatch()` function now:

1. Adds an `error` event handler on the forked process to catch spawn/IPC failures
2. Captures the exit code and signal in the `exit` handler for descriptive error messages
3. Reports errors with specific detail: `"worker killed by signal SIGKILL"`,
   `"worker exited with code 1"`, or `"worker error: <message>"` instead of
   the generic `"worker crashed"`

## Files Changed

- `scripts/run-test262.ts` -- added `error` handler, improved `exit` handler with code/signal
