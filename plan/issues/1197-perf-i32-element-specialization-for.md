origin: surfaced by 2026-04-27 competitive-benchmark refresh — array-sum is ~9× slower than Node. Per-element box/unbox is the third dominant overhead alongside grow-on-write (#1195) and bounds checks (#1196).

# #1197 — i32 element specialization for `number[]` arrays in i32-shaped expressions

## Problem

For an array typed as `number[]` (or inferred to hold only numbers), js2wasm currently allocates a WasmGC `array<f64>` (or `array<anyref>` for un-narrowed cases). On every `arr[i] = expr` the i32 result of the expression is **promoted to f64** before storage; on every read the f64 is converted back. For the `array-sum` benchmark this happens 2 million times in the hot path.

The benchmark expressions are i32-shaped by the user's explicit annotations:

```js
values[i] = ((i * 17) ^ (i >>> 3)) & 1023;   // & forces i32 truncation
sum = (sum + values[i]) | 0;                  // | 0 forces i32 truncation
```

Despite these explicit i32 markers, we round-trip through f64. V8's SMI tagging makes `i * 17`, `i >>> 3`, `& 1023`, `| 0` all 1-cycle ops on tagged 31-bit ints. We can't replicate SMI tagging inside Wasm, but we **can** specialise the array storage: emit `array<mut i32>` instead of `array<mut f64>`, and lower the i32-shaped expressions directly without the f64 round-trip.

The #1126 int32 inference work shipped this for **scalar locals** (`let x: number` becomes an i32 local when the use-pattern is i32-shaped). Arrays didn't get the same treatment.

## Implementation plan

### Phase 1 — type-inference for array element types

Extend `src/codegen/native-strings.ts`'s int32-inference machinery (or a parallel module — `src/codegen/array-element-typing.ts`) to walk each array allocation and decide if its element type can be `i32`.

A `number[]` array element type can lower to `i32` when ALL of:
1. Every assignment `arr[i] = E` has `E` of inferred type `i32` (i32-shaped per #1126's existing rules — terminates in `| 0`, `>>`, `>>>`, `& mask`, `^ mask`, etc., or comes from another i32 source like `arr.length` or a `for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)` index).
2. Every read `arr[i]` is consumed in an i32 context (passed to an i32-shaped expression, used as another array index, etc.) OR is converted to f64 explicitly via assignment to a `number` non-i32-shaped variable (in which case we emit `f64.convert_i32_s` at the read site).
3. The array is not aliased to a `Float64Array`-or-similar typed view.

If all conditions hold, emit `array<mut i32>` and generate `array.set` / `array.get` with i32 ops. Otherwise fall back to current behaviour.

### Phase 2 — peephole removal of redundant `| 0` after i32 array reads

When the read of an i32 array element is immediately followed by `| 0` (the JS programmer's "trust me this is i32" annotation), the `| 0` becomes a no-op since the value is already i32. Remove via the existing peephole pass (`src/codegen/peephole.ts`).

Same for `& mask` / `>>> 0` patterns where the mask covers the full i32 range.

### Phase 3 — heap-typed array specialization (optional, follow-up)

For arrays allocated as `new Array(n)` or `[]` and used only with i32 elements, also try `Int32Array` semantics — same fast path as Phase 1 but skips the WasmGC array entirely if a TypedArray-like backing store is faster on the target. Defer; Phase 1+2 should be enough to close most of the gap.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `array-sum` competitive benchmark `runtimeArg=1000000` hot runtime improves by **at least 2×** standalone (no escape analysis, no bounds-check elimination). Combined with #1195 + #1196, total improvement should be ~4–6×.
2. New equivalence test in `tests/issue-1191.test.ts`:
   - i32-shaped array → emits `array<mut i32>` (verify via wast disassembly or a dedicated check)
   - Mixed i32/f64 array → falls back to `array<mut f64>` (no regression)
   - Array escapes to a function that may treat elements as f64 → falls back to `array<mut f64>`
   - Read of i32-shaped element followed by `| 0` → peephole eliminates the redundant `| 0`
3. The existing #1126 int32-inference tests (scalar locals) still pass.
4. CI test262 net delta ≥ 0; no arrays-related regressions.

## Out of scope

- SMI-style runtime tagging (we can't do that inside Wasm without giving up GC integration). Static specialisation is the right path.
- Float64Array / typed-array-backed storage for f64 arrays (separate optimisation track).
- Generic numeric tower (BigInt etc.).

## Risk

Type-inference soundness — the inference must be conservative. If we promote an array to i32 storage and then a code path reads an element and treats it as f64 (e.g. passes it to `Math.sqrt`), we get garbage unless the read site converts. The implementation must either:
- Only specialise arrays whose every read is provably i32-consumed, OR
- Insert `f64.convert_i32_s` at every f64-context read site automatically.

The second is simpler and more permissive; soundness is local to each read site.

## Notes

This is the `i32 element specialization` Tier 1 win called out in the array-sum perf analysis after the 2026-04-27 bench refresh. Composes multiplicatively with #1195 (escape analysis) and #1196 (bounds-check elimination).

When all three Tier 1 issues land, expected `array-sum` hot-runtime: ~20–30 ms (down from 145 ms). That's within ~2× of Node and ~5–6× ahead of Javy — the right competitive headline.

## Implementation summary (2026-05-01)

Phase 1 + Phase 2 landed.

**Pre-pass** (`src/codegen/array-element-typing.ts:collectI32SpecializedArrays`):
- Per-function syntactic analysis. Candidate = `let/const arr: number[] = []`
  (or `new Array(n?)` / `Array(n?)`) declared inside the function body.
- Disqualifications: closure capture, escape via function call, return,
  reassignment, any method call other than `.push(<i32-shaped>)`, any element
  write whose RHS is not i32-safe per the local `isI32SafeExprForArray` helper
  (mirrors `collectI32CoercedLocals`'s rules — bitwise/shift/comparison ops,
  arithmetic of i32-safe operands, references to known-i32 locals or for-loop
  counters).
- Fed by `i32CoercedLocals` (already computed by `collectI32CoercedLocals`)
  so `arr[i] = sum` qualifies whenever `sum` is itself i32-coerced.

**Codegen hook**:
- `FunctionContext.i32SpecializedArrays?: Set<string>` (new field).
- `statements/variables.ts` overrides the local's wasm type to
  `ref_null __vec_i32` and sets the transient `_i32ElemArrayOverride` flag on
  the codegen context across the initializer compilation.
- `literals.ts:compileArrayLiteral` (empty-array path) and
  `compileArrayConstructorCall` consult the override and emit `i32` element
  kind in place of the contextual type's `f64`.
- `expressions/new-super.ts` does the same for `new Array(...)`.

**Phase 2 peephole** (`src/codegen/peephole.ts` Pattern 6):
- `i32.const 0; i32.or` → nothing. Wasm validation requires the value below
  `i32.or` to already be i32, so OR-ing with 0 is identity. Safe regardless
  of whether the upstream value came from a specialized array or any other
  i32 source.

**No new host imports**, no runtime changes — pure Wasm-IR optimization.

## Test Results

- `tests/equivalence/issue-1197.test.ts` (new): 14/14 passing
  - 7 behavioural equivalence tests (canonical bitwise pattern, redundant
    `| 0`, Math.sqrt cross-type read, .push, compound bitwise, two arrays in
    one function, nested loops over two specialized arrays)
  - 6 structural WAT-presence tests (`__vec_i32` / `__arr_i32` appears
    only when promotion fires; not when the array escapes / is captured /
    has non-i32-shaped writes / uses .map)
  - 1 peephole test (`(n | 0) | 0 | 0` collapses to ≤2 `i32.or` ops)
- Equivalence regression sweep (~165 tests across array, compound-assignment,
  scope, gradual-typing, bounds-elim, peephole, math, loose-equality,
  long-binary-chains, i32-loop-compare): no new failures vs origin/main.
  Pre-existing failures on baseline (TS-strictness in
  `array-inline-return.test.ts`, `iife-and-call-expressions.test.ts`,
  `gradual-typing.test.ts`) reproduce identically.
