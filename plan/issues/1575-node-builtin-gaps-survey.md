# Node.js built-in module support — gap survey

Companion to the parallel surveys (axios, React, TypeScript, ESLint
next-layer). Those map a **per-package** failure surface; this one maps the
**LANGUAGE-INDEPENDENT host-import surface** that any npm package built on
Node will pull through `src/import-resolver.ts`.

## Method

1. Walked `NODE_BUILTIN_MODULES` (`src/import-resolver.ts:16-50`,
   33 entries).
2. For each module, classified support level by tracing the code path:
   - `preprocessImports` (line 89) replaces the import with `declare const
     X: any`; the binding is added to `nodeBuiltins[]`.
   - `registerNodeBuiltinImports` (`src/codegen/index.ts:7447`) emits a
     **single host import** `__node_<module>` typed `() -> externref` that
     returns the require(module) object verbatim.
   - At call sites, member access + invocation goes through
     `__extern_method_call` (`src/runtime.ts:3391`).
   - A handful of modules have **inlined codegen** that bypasses the
     externref path: `fs` (#1491 readFileSync/writeFileSync, #1035 WASI
     path_open), `crypto` (#1492 randomBytes/randomUUID), `console` (#1493
     stderr routing — global, not import), `process` (#1490 argv/env,
     #1482 WASI environ_get).
3. Confirmed by grepping `src/` for `node:<mod>`, `__node_<mod>`,
   `node_builtin_fn`, `<module>.<method>` codegen dispatch.

## Glossary — what the levels mean

| Level | What runs | What breaks |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **None** | The import resolves to a stub `declare const X: any`; calls go through the opaque-externref host import. With a JS host that has `require`, methods work via runtime extern dispatch. **Standalone (WASI/browser): traps or returns undefined.** | Anything that needs the *shape* of the module at compile time (instanceof, structural typing, dependency injection). No standalone fallback. |
| **Partial** | A few named functions get dedicated host imports (`__node_fs_readFileSync` etc.) bound at instantiation; the rest fall through to the externref path. | Surface beyond the wired names; standalone targets still fail. |
| **Functional** | Enough surface is wired (host imports + types) that common npm packages compile, instantiate, and run on Node host. | Still typically no standalone (WASI/browser) coverage; performance-sensitive paths re-enter JS. |

> Today, the *highest* level reached anywhere is **Partial**, and only for
> `fs`, `crypto`, `console`, `process` after the #1490–#1494 wave landed.
> All 26 other entries in `NODE_BUILTIN_MODULES` are **None** (opaque
> externref pass-through, JS host required at run time).

\* "Blocked-package signal" tracks which of the four parallel-surveyed
target packages (axios, React, ESLint, prettier, TypeScript) named the
builtin as a requirement (per #1032, #1287, #1289, #1400, #eslint-next-layer).
React is intentionally absent from most rows — it's the "no Node deps"
control. ESLint/prettier/TypeScript form the "node-CLI" cluster; axios
forms the "node-network" cluster.

## How "None" actually behaves at runtime

For a "None" builtin, **the import is not a hard compile error**:

1. `preprocessImports` turns `import http from 'node:http'` into
   `declare const http: any` (`src/import-resolver.ts:402`).
2. `registerNodeBuiltinImports` emits `__node_http: () -> externref`.
3. `resolveImport` (`src/runtime.ts:4751`) calls `require("http")` and
   returns the actual module object as externref.
4. `http.createServer({...}, handler)` lowers to `__extern_method_call`,
   which JS-side does `mod.createServer.apply(mod, args)`.

**This works on Node** as long as the caller has `require` and the args
are JS-coercible. It **fails everywhere else** (browser, WASI, standalone
wasmtime) because:
- `_getNodeRequire()` returns `null`,
- The host import resolves to `() => {}`,
- The method call traps on a missing property.

It also fails *on Node* when:
- The user code does `instanceof http.IncomingMessage` — extern objects
  don't participate in WasmGC instance tests.
- The callback signature is non-trivial (Wasm-side closures get
  serialized as extern stubs; `EventEmitter.on("data", fn)` can fire `fn`
  with a Buffer argument the Wasm side can't unpack — see #983).
- The return value is a stream the Wasm code tries to consume by
  property access on a hot path.

### 2026-06-02 validation note

Added `tests/issue-1575.test.ts` as an executable survey guard. It confirms:

- `NODE_BUILTIN_MODULES` currently covers 33 normalized builtin module names.
- Default builtin imports for unsupported modules (`path`, `http`, `events`)
  still route through opaque whole-module imports (`__node_<module>` with
  `node_builtin` intent).
- Typed single-function exceptions remain limited to the current `fs`
  (`readFileSync`/`writeFileSync`, gated by `allowFs`) and `crypto`
  (`randomBytes`/`randomUUID`) paths.
- Unsupported named imports are an even sharper npm gap than the default import
  path: `import { join } from "node:path"` and
  `import { createHash } from "node:crypto"` compile today as generic env
  function stubs (`join`, `createHash`) rather than `node_builtin` or
  `node_builtin_fn` imports. Follow-up builtin work should therefore cover both
  default/namespace and named-import forms.

## Top 5 highest-leverage builtins to invest in

Ranking by (a) number of distinct target packages blocked, (b) breadth of
the package class they unlock, (c) implementation effort needed for a
**Tier 0** (smoke test — minimal surface) milestone.

### 1. `node:path` — pure compute, blocks ESLint/prettier/axios/TS — child issue #1791

- Why: every CLI assembles paths; `path.join`/`path.resolve`/`path.dirname`
  fire in every module loader. Pure-string functions — no I/O — so a
  standalone fallback is feasible (port the Node sources into a
  user-mode TS shim, similar to what we did for #1473's error helpers).
- **Tier 0 test**: `path.join("/a", "b", "../c") === "/a/c"` and
  `path.basename("/foo/bar.ts", ".ts") === "bar"`.
- Implementation tier: host import (#1490-style) for Node target, with
  a TS-port fallback for WASI/standalone (#1471/#1472 pattern). Cost: low
  to medium.
- Cross-ref: blocks #1400 (ESLint), #1032 (axios), TypeScript survey.

### 2. `node:url` — URL/URLSearchParams, blocks ESLint/prettier/axios — child issue #1792

- Why: `new URL(...)`, `URL.fileURLToPath`, `URLSearchParams` are
  *constructor* shapes — not method calls on a require()'d object — so
  the current `__node_url` opaque-externref path can't even reach them
  (you need `new url.URL(...)`, which our extern bridge does support, but
  most code writes the global form). URL is also a **WHATWG global** in
  Node and browsers, which makes it cleaner to expose as a host
  constructor.
- **Tier 0 test**: `new URL("./b", "file:///a/").pathname === "/b"` and
  `new URLSearchParams("a=1&a=2").getAll("a")` is `["1","2"]`.
- Implementation tier: bind `URL` / `URLSearchParams` as host
  constructors (like `Date` is wired). Standalone fallback would mean
  porting a tiny URL parser — defer to a follow-up. Cost: medium.
- Cross-ref: ESLint module loader (file:// paths), axios request
  serialization.

### 3. `node:buffer` + global `Buffer` — required by axios + crypto + zlib — child issue #1793

- Why: Buffer underlies every `node:http` body, every `node:fs` non-utf8
  read, every `node:crypto` digest. Compiled code that touches *any* of
  these crashes on the very first `Buffer.from(...)` because Buffer is
  also a *global* — not just from `require("buffer")`. The opaque-extern
  path **can't** handle the global form at all; codegen needs to
  recognise `Buffer` as an extern class similar to how `Date` is treated.
- **Tier 0 test**: `Buffer.from("hi", "utf-8").toString("utf-8") === "hi"`
  and `Buffer.concat([Buffer.from("a"), Buffer.from("b")]).length === 2`.
  Bonus: passing a `Uint8Array` to a host import takes a Buffer
  view in JS-land without copying.
- Implementation tier: bind `Buffer` constructor and a handful of static
  methods as host imports; map `Buffer.prototype.{toString,slice}` to
  externref method dispatch. Cost: medium-high (encoding matrix is the
  long-tail).
- Cross-ref: #1032 (axios), zlib consumers, anything talking to fs binary.

### 4. `node:events` / global `EventEmitter` — universal Node primitive — child issue #1794

- Why: every Node IO API (`fs.createReadStream`, `http.IncomingMessage`,
  `process` itself) is an `EventEmitter`. Subscribing from compiled code
  requires passing a Wasm closure as a host-side callback. The current
  `__extern_method_call` path *can* pass closures (#1382 wasm-closure JS
  bridge), but the receiver expects `(arg) => ...` JS shape, and the
  argument types (Buffer, Error) need to round-trip cleanly. Wire a
  first-class `EventEmitter` extern class with constrained event shapes.
- **Tier 0 test**:
  ```ts
  import { EventEmitter } from "node:events";
  const e = new EventEmitter();
  let got = 0;
  e.on("tick", (n: number) => { got = n; });
  e.emit("tick", 42);  // got === 42
  ```
- Implementation tier: host-import constructor + one round-trip closure
  pattern. Standalone fallback is feasible (EventEmitter is pure JS, ~200
  lines). Cost: medium; the long pole is the closure-callback contract.
- Cross-ref: unlocks #1032 (axios uses streams under the hood), prepares
  #640 (WASI HTTP) by exercising the same callback wiring.

### 5. `node:http` (+ `node:https`) — direct unblocker for axios — child issue #1795

- Why: axios is the highest-value real-world target on the backlog
  (#1032 high priority). HTTP is also a natural place to land **the
  bidirectional host-import contract**: Wasm passes a request descriptor
  out, host returns a response stream, Wasm reads via `EventEmitter`
  (depends on #4 above). A Tier 0 here is a single "GET URL → string"
  round-trip — that alone validates the whole chain.
- **Tier 0 test**:
  ```ts
  import { get } from "node:http";
  function fetchText(url: string, cb: (s: string) => void): void {
    get(url, (res) => {
      let body = "";
      res.on("data", (chunk: any) => { body += chunk.toString(); });
      res.on("end", () => cb(body));
    });
  }
  ```
  Then test against a localhost server in CI.
- Implementation tier: depends on #3 (Buffer), #4 (EventEmitter). After
  those, http is "wire the host import." Standalone HTTP belongs to
  #640 (WASI HTTP / wasi:http/incoming-handler) — out of scope for
  Tier 0.
- Cross-ref: #1032, #640, #1500 (browser fetch — parallel design).

## Honourable mentions / fast-follows

- `node:util.promisify` — one function, unblocks every old-style
  callback API. Tier 0: `promisify(fs.readFile)(path) → Promise<Buffer>`.
- `node:assert` (strict) — needed by ESLint internals; pure compute, no
  host needed once #1473 (Wasm-native exceptions) lands.
- `node:os.platform/.arch/.homedir/.tmpdir` — three string constants
  resolved at runtime. ~30 lines for a host import + a standalone fallback
  reading `__wasi_runtime` env. Useful for prettier's config search.
- `node:querystring` — pure compute; could share code with the
  `URLSearchParams` from #2.

## Recommended sprint slice (proposal, not a commitment)

The four packages this work unblocks split cleanly along the matrix:

- **`path` + `url` + `__dirname`** (#1494 already in-review): unblocks
  *every* Node CLI (ESLint, prettier, TypeScript). No I/O — pure compute
  — so they double as standalone-mode wins (relevant to #1535's audit).
- **`Buffer` + `events`**: foundation for everything in the "node-network"
  cluster (axios, http frameworks). Specifically gates the Tier-0 axios
  benchmark in #1032.
- **`http` + `https`**: the demonstrator; lands on top of the previous
  two. Pairs with #640 for the WASI variant.

## Out of scope for this survey

- Wiring the actual implementations. Each of the top-5 deserves its own
  ticket with the Tier 0 test as the acceptance criterion.
- Standalone (WASI) coverage for #3–#5; treat that as a follow-up
  alongside #1535 / #1470–#1474.
- Web-platform globals (fetch, Web Streams, TextEncoder); see
  #1500/#1501 in the browser-host track.

## Completion Summary (2026-06-03)

Survey verified against current `main` and finalized.

**Verification:**
- `NODE_BUILTIN_MODULES` (`src/import-resolver.ts:16-50`) still has the same
  33 entries the survey documented.
- `registerNodeBuiltinImports` (`src/codegen/index.ts:9801`) still emits a
  single opaque `__node_<module>: () -> externref` per builtin and binds it as
  a declared global — confirming every "None" row.
- `NODE_BUILTIN_FN_TYPED_STUBS` (`src/import-resolver.ts:68`) still only wires
  `crypto.randomBytes` / `crypto.randomUUID`; `fs.readFileSync`/`writeFileSync`
  remain the other typed-fn exception. No new builtin gained dedicated function
  imports since 2026-06-02, so the Partial-vs-None classification in the matrix
  is unchanged. No matrix rows needed upgrading.

**Child issues filed** (top-5 highest-leverage `None`/`Partial` builtins from
the "Top 5 highest-leverage builtins" section, ranked by blocked-package
signal):

| Child | Builtin | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| #1791 | `node:path` | pure compute; blocks ESLint/prettier/axios/TS; standalone-feasible |
| #1792 | `node:url` | URL/URLSearchParams host constructors; ESLint/prettier/axios |
| #1793 | `node:buffer` + global `Buffer` | underlies http/fs/crypto bodies; axios/zlib |
| #1794 | `node:events` / `EventEmitter` | universal Node IO primitive; closure-callback contract |
| #1795 | `node:http` (+https) | axios GET round-trip; depends_on #1793 + #1794 |

Each child carries problem + Tier 0 acceptance criteria + a concrete
implementation approach, mirroring the survey's per-builtin analysis. #1795 is
explicitly `depends_on: [1793, 1794]` since the http response stream chain
needs both Buffer and EventEmitter.

Honourable-mention builtins (`util.promisify`, `assert`, `os.*`,
`querystring`) are documented above but not filed as child issues yet — they
are lower-leverage fast-follows once the top 5 land.
