# Issue #247: Arithmetic with null/undefined produces wrong results

## Status: in-review
## Summary

Several tests fail because arithmetic operations with null/undefined values produce wrong results. Tests like `S11.5.1_A3_T1.5.js` (multiplication) and `S11.6.2_A3_T1.5.js` (subtraction) check that `null * null === 0`, `undefined - undefined` is NaN, etc. The runtime returns wrong values.

Related: `S11.13.2_A4.1_T1.4.js` (compound assignment with null), `S11.13.2_A4.4_T1.3.js`, `S11.13.2_A4.5_T1.4.js`.

## Root Cause

When null or undefined flow into arithmetic operations, they should be coerced via ToNumber:
- `null` -> 0
- `undefined` -> NaN

The codegen may not be inserting proper coercion when operands are null/undefined typed. Null might be represented as `ref.null` (a struct ref), which cannot directly participate in f64 arithmetic.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- arithmetic operator coercion
- Tests affected: ~6 runtime failures

## Expected Impact

Fixes ~6 runtime failures related to null/undefined arithmetic.

## Suggested Approach

1. In arithmetic expression codegen, when an operand is null-typed or undefined-typed:
   - For null: emit `f64.const 0` instead of the null ref
   - For undefined: emit `f64.const nan` (NaN)
2. Check both binary operators (+, -, *, /, %) and compound assignment operators (+=, -=, etc.)
3. Some of this may already exist (see MEMORY.md notes on null/undefined in f64 context) but may not cover all operator types

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `null * null === 0` evaluates correctly
- [x] `undefined - undefined` produces NaN
- [x] Compound assignment with null/undefined works
- [x] All 10 equivalence tests pass

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Notes

Two root causes fixed:

### 1. Literal null/undefined not detected through type assertions (expressions.ts)
The fast-path in `compileExpression` that emits `f64.const 0` for null and `f64.const NaN`
for undefined only checked the top-level expression node. When null/undefined appeared inside
type assertions like `(null as any)` or `(undefined as any)`, the `AsExpression` wrapper
prevented detection. Fix: unwrap `AsExpression`, `ParenthesizedExpression`,
`NonNullExpression`, and `TypeAssertion` before checking for null/undefined keywords.
Also extended to handle `i32` expectedType (fast mode).

### 2. `__any_to_f64` returned 0 for undefined (index.ts)
The `__any_to_f64` helper in the AnyValue gradual typing system only checked for tag==2 (i32)
and fell through to f64val for everything else. Since undefined (tag=1) has f64val=0.0, it
incorrectly returned 0 instead of NaN. Fix: added tag==1 check returning `f64.const NaN`,
and tag==4 (bool) check converting i32val to f64.
