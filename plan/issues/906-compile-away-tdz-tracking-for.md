# #906 -- Compile away TDZ tracking for definite-assignment top-level numeric locals

## Problem

This simple top-level loop still emits runtime TDZ tracking for `result`:

```ts
function squared(n) {
  return n * n;
}

let result = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
  result += squared(10);
}

console.log(result);
```

Current emitted WAT includes:

```wat
(global $__mod_result (mut f64) (f64.const 0))
(global $__tdz_result (mut i32) (i32.const 0))
...
f64.const 0
global.set 2
i32.const 1
global.set 3
```

For this example, the TDZ state is known statically:

- `result` is initialized immediately
- all later reads occur after that initializer
- there is no closure, deferred execution, or interleaving control flow that can observe an uninitialized read

The runtime TDZ global and writes are unnecessary overhead.

## Goal

Compile away TDZ tracking for top-level/module-init locals when definite-assignment analysis can prove the variable is initialized before every read.

## Requirements

1. Recognize simple top-level/module-init definite-assignment patterns like the example above
2. Avoid creating `__tdz_*` globals or locals for those proven-safe bindings
3. Avoid emitting initialization writes such as `global.set __tdz_result`
4. Preserve runtime TDZ behavior for genuinely dynamic or ambiguous cases
5. Add regression coverage using the example above

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§14.3.1 Let and Const Declarations](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-let-and-const-declarations) — variables are in TDZ from scope entry until their declaration is evaluated
- [§9.1.1.1.4 InitializeBinding](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-declarative-environment-records-initializebinding-n-v) — removes TDZ for the binding
- [§9.1.1.1.2 GetBindingValue](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-declarative-environment-records-getbindingvalue-n-s) — step 3: throw ReferenceError if binding is uninitialized


## Acceptance criteria

- the example above no longer emits `__tdz_result`
- the example above no longer emits TDZ writes in `__module_init`
- runtime TDZ checks remain for cases that cannot be proven safe statically

## Implementation notes

- Added `computeElidableTopLevelTdzNames` in `src/codegen/expressions/identifiers.ts`
  that walks the source file, finds every Identifier resolving to a top-level
  let/const declaration, and runs `analyzeTdzAccess` on each. If every read
  returns `"skip"`, the name is elided.
- `src/codegen/declarations.ts` calls this helper just before allocating the
  TDZ flag globals and removes elidable names from `ctx.tdzLetConstNames`.
  The downstream code paths (`emitTdzInit`, `emitTdzCheck`, the read-site
  analysis at `expressions/identifiers.ts:340`) all already short-circuit
  when `tdzGlobals.get(name)` is undefined, so no other call sites needed
  changes.
- Conservative behaviour preserved: hoisted function declarations that read
  a top-level let/const, forward references, closures captured before init,
  and reads inside a loop that wraps the declaration all still emit runtime
  TDZ tracking (because `analyzeTdzAccess` returns `"throw"` or `"check"`
  for those cases).

## Test results

- `tests/issue-906.test.ts` — 11/11 pass (new). Covers the issue's exact
  example, multi-decl elision, hoisted-function preserve, forward-reference
  preserve, arrow-before-init preserve, arrow-after-init elide, loop reads
  not containing decl elide, unused let elide, end-to-end loop sum.
- `tests/issue-800.test.ts` — 7/7 pass (existing static TDZ optimization).
- `tests/issue-899.test.ts` — 7/7 pass (existing closure-capture TDZ).
- `tests/issue-723-tdz.test.ts` — 7/7 pass (runtime TDZ enforcement).
- `tests/issue-1053-arguments-global-staleness.test.ts` — 1/1 pass.
- `tests/equivalence/var-hoisting-scope.test.ts` — 12/12 pass.
- `tests/equivalence/scope-and-error-handling.test.ts` — 5/5 pass.
- `tests/equivalence/global-type-checks.test.ts` — 9/9 pass.
- `tests/equivalence/global-index-shift-trycatch.test.ts` and
  `multi-file-compilation.test.ts` — 35/35 combined pass.
- Pre-existing failures (verified to fail on `origin/main` without this
  change too, unrelated):
  - `tests/equivalence/tdz-reference-error.test.ts` — 6 fails (validator
    emits TDZ violations as `severity: "warning"`, tests expect `"error"`).
  - `tests/issue-790.test.ts` — 4 fails (function-local TDZ runtime
    behaviour, unrelated to module-level optimization).
