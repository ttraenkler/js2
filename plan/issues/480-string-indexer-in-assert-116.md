# #480 — String() indexer in assert (116 tests)

116 tests skipped for "String() indexer in assert". Investigate what pattern this matches and whether it can be narrowed or removed. The String() constructor as a function is implemented (#349).

## Implementation Summary

**What was done:** Confirmed that the skip filter was already removed. The `String() indexer in assert` skip was removed as part of #349 (feat: String() constructor as function, commit a4f08875). Line 505 of `tests/test262-runner.ts` contains only a comment: `// (Removed: String() indexer skip -- compiler now handles String() coercion)`.

**Resolution:** No code changes needed. The issue was created during a skip analysis pass (c8e57bdf) after the filter had already been removed by #349. This issue is already resolved.

**Files relevant:**
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` (line 505 -- removal comment already present)

**Tests now passing:** The 116 previously-skipped tests are now evaluated normally (no longer skipped by this filter). They will pass or fail based on their actual compilation/runtime behavior.
