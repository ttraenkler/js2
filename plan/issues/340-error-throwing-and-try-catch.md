# #340 -- Error throwing and try/catch/finally

## Status: in-review
## Implementation Summary

### What was done
The throw/catch/finally infrastructure already existed in the codebase (compileTryStatement,
compileThrowStatement, ensureExnTag, binary encoding). The main blocker was that `new Error(msg)`
and related error constructors were being registered as extern classes requiring host imports
(`Error_new`, `TypeError_new`, etc.), which meant instantiation failed unless the host provided
those functions.

Changes made:
1. **Inline Error constructors** (`src/codegen/expressions.ts`): Added handling for
   `new Error(msg)`, `new TypeError(msg)`, `new RangeError(msg)`, `new SyntaxError(msg)`,
   `new URIError(msg)`, `new EvalError(msg)`, `new ReferenceError(msg)` in `compileNewExpression`.
   These now compile inline as externref (the message string), avoiding host imports.

2. **Skip Error types from extern class registration** (`src/codegen/index.ts`): Added Error
   types to BUILTIN_SKIP set and created ERROR_TYPES_SKIP guard in `collectExternFromDeclareVar`
   and `collectExternClass` to prevent generating host constructor imports.

3. **Test262 runner updates** (`tests/test262-runner.ts`):
   - Removed throw-to-return rewriting (`replaceThrowTest262Error`, `replaceOtherThrows`)
   - Removed the throw+try/catch skip filter (was skipping 1,337 tests)
   - Added try/catch wrapper around test body so thrown exceptions set `__fail = 1`

4. **New equivalence tests** (`tests/equivalence/try-catch-throw.test.ts`): 14 tests covering:
   - throw new Error caught by catch
   - throw string/number literals caught
   - code after throw not executed
   - try without throw runs normally
   - nested try-catch
   - throw in catch re-throws to outer
   - try-finally without catch
   - try-catch-finally normal and exception paths
   - throw from called function
   - catch without variable binding
   - new TypeError/RangeError handled inline

### What worked
- The Wasm exception handling proposal instructions (try/catch/catch_all/throw/rethrow) were
  already fully implemented in codegen and binary encoding
- The exception tag infrastructure (ensureExnTag) was already in place
- All 14 new equivalence tests pass
- No regressions in existing tests (555 pass, 7 pre-existing failures)

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- inline Error constructor handling
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- skip Error types from extern class registration
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- remove throw rewriting, add try/catch wrapper
- `tests/equivalence/try-catch-throw.test.ts` -- new test file (14 tests)
