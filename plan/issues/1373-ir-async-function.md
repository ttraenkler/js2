# #1373 — IR: async function support

## Joint architect spec (S53)

Phase A+B of this issue (selector bucket + IR node types) is **done** and
provides the IR contract that the S53 async cluster builds on. The joint
spec at `plan/issues/sprints/53/async-cluster-architect-spec.md` treats this
issue's `IrInstrAwait` / `IrInstrAsyncReturn` / `IrInstrAsyncThrow` node
types as the **authoritative** state-machine representation. #1042's AST
lowering and #1373b's CPS pass both target these nodes.

## Resolution (2026-05-20)

This umbrella issue is **done**; remaining work has been split into follow-ups:

- **Phase A — selector + IR fallback bucket separation** — shipped in PR #328
  (commit `ba7c69ecf`). `src/ir/select.ts:79` introduces the new
  `"async-function"` fallback reason distinct from `"async-generator"`, and
  the body-shape/method checks at `src/ir/select.ts:463-481` bucket plain
  `async function` / `async` class methods into it.

- **Phase B — IR node types** — shipped alongside Phase A.
  `src/ir/nodes.ts:597,615,631` declares `IrInstrAwait`, `IrInstrAsyncReturn`,
  and `IrInstrAsyncThrow`. `src/ir/lower.ts:1773-1778` has the switch arms
  in place; they currently throw with a "Phase C / #1373b — not yet
  implemented" marker so accidental construction surfaces clearly.

- **Phase C — CPS lowering (the actual gate flip)** — tracked separately as
  **#1373b** (`status: blocked`). Phase C depends on **#1326c Phase 1C-B**
  (`emitStandalonePromiseThen` standalone wiring); #1326c Phase 1C-A
  (microtask queue + drain) is in CI as PR #405 but the `.then` integration
  is explicitly deferred to a follow-up PR. The PENDING-await continuation
  wrapper interacts non-trivially with the GC closure infrastructure (per
  the #1326c commit message and the #1373b issue file's "harder than
  estimated" note), so the right time to design it is after Phase 1C-B
  lands a stable `Promise.then` foundation.

No further work belongs in this issue. New scope flows into #1373b.

## Joint spec pointer (S53 architect — 2026-05-20)

The full implementation plan covering this umbrella + #1373b + #1042
is in **`1373b-ir-async-cps-lowering.md`** under
`## Implementation Plan (S53 architect — joint spec for #1042 / #1373 / #1373b)`.

Key points relevant to #1373's scope:

- **Phase A (selector + IR fallback bucket)** — done in PR #328
  (`ba7c69ecf`). The `async-function` bucket count in
  `scripts/ir-fallback-baseline.json` is the gating metric: it goes to
  zero when #1373b Slice 3 (gate-flip) lands.
- **Phase B (IR node types)** — done in PR #328. `IrInstrAwait`,
  `IrInstrAsyncReturn`, `IrInstrAsyncThrow` exist; from-ast does NOT
  emit them yet (Slice 1b in #1373b adds the wiring).
- **Phase C (CPS lowering)** — split into Slice 1 (done, gate=false),
  Slice 1b (from-ast emission), Slice 2 (PENDING-path state machine),
  Slice 3 (gate flip). See #1373b for detailed file:line targets and
  Wasm IR patterns.

This issue stays `status: done` — all umbrella tracking is in #1373b.

## Problem

`async function` declarations are currently rejected by the IR selector. The selector checks:

```typescript
if (stmt.modifiers?.some(m => m.kind === ts.SyntaxKind.AsyncKeyword)) {
  return "async-generator"; // shared with async generators for now
}
```

(The exact check may differ but async functions don't make it to the body-shape check.)

Regular `async function` (not `async function*`) is a common and important pattern. The
#1326 work (async microtask queue Phase 1A/B) is building the standalone `$Promise` WasmGC
struct — once that lands, async functions can be lowered through IR using it.

## Root cause

The IR has no concept of `await` expressions or `Promise` return values. The from-ast lowerer
has no `IrNode` for `await`. The selector therefore rejects all async shapes.

## Dependency

Depends on #1326 Phase 1B (`$Promise` WasmGC struct) being merged. The IR async path will
use `$Promise` as the result type and emit microtask-queue calls for `await`.

## Implementation plan

### Phase A: selector (conditional on #1326 Phase 1B)

In `src/ir/select.ts`:
1. Separate `"async-generator"` rejection into `"async-generator"` (for `async function*`)
   and `"async-function"` (for plain `async function`).
2. Add `"async-function"` as a **conditionally supported** shape when the module has
   `$Promise` struct registered (check via a passed-in flag `supportsAsyncIr: boolean`).
3. Body shape check for async functions: allow `await <expr>` at any point where a tail
   expression is expected (new `isPhase1AsyncExpr` variant).

### Phase B: IR nodes

In `src/ir/nodes.ts`, add:
```typescript
{ kind: "await"; operand: IrNode }           // suspends, stores continuation
{ kind: "async-return"; value: IrNode }       // wraps result in resolved Promise
{ kind: "async-throw"; error: IrNode }        // wraps error in rejected Promise
```

### Phase C: lowering

In `src/ir/lower.ts`:
- `IrNode.await` → emit calls into the microtask queue API from #1326:
  `__promise_then($promise, $continuation_closure)`.
- The continuation closure is a lifted IR function capturing the local state.
- `IrNode.async-return` → `__promise_resolve($result)`.

This is a CPS transform at the IR level — each `await` splits the function into a
pre-await prefix and a post-await continuation. The prefix returns a pending Promise;
the continuation is scheduled via the microtask queue.

### Phase D: integration

The `IrIntegrationReport` will report async functions by their `${name}/continuation_N`
synthesized names. These synthesized functions are emitted as closures via the existing
lifted-closure path (Slice 3).

## Acceptance criteria

1. `async function fetch(url: string): Promise<number> { const r = await doHttp(url); return r.status; }`
   is IR-claimed (with `supportsAsyncIr: true`) and emits via microtask queue.
2. `await` on a non-Promise value wraps it in `Promise.resolve()` before suspending.
3. Unhandled rejection propagation works (async throw reaches the microtask queue).
4. Existing legacy async equivalence tests all pass.

## Files

- `src/ir/select.ts` — separate async/async-generator rejections, add conditional claim
- `src/ir/nodes.ts` — `IrNode.await`, `IrNode.asyncReturn`
- `src/ir/from-ast.ts` — `await` expression lowering
- `src/ir/lower.ts` — CPS transform for await continuations
- `src/ir/integration.ts` — thread `supportsAsyncIr` flag from codegen context

## Notes

This is the hardest IR task. Block it on #1326 Phase 1B. Consider splitting into:
- #1373a: selector + nodes (no lowering yet, just claim infrastructure)
- #1373b: CPS lowering + integration
