# #1121 -- Infer numeric recursive fast path without JSDoc hints on exported entrypoints

## Problem

The competitive recursive Fibonacci benchmark currently depends on JSDoc number
annotations to stay on the efficient numeric codegen path.

Benchmark file:

- `benchmarks/competitive/programs/fib-recursive.js`

Observed behavior:

1. With both JSDoc annotations present:
   - `fib(n)` annotated
   - `run(n)` annotated
   - `js2wasm -> Node.js` and `js2wasm -> Wasmtime` both compile and run on the
     lean fast path
2. With all hints removed:
   - `js2wasm -> Node.js` fails at instantiation
   - `js2wasm -> Wasmtime` regresses to non-WASI imports and much larger output
3. With only the exported `run(n)` annotated:
   - still regresses
   - `js2wasm -> Node.js` returns the wrong result (`0` instead of `55`)
   - `js2wasm -> Wasmtime` still falls off the clean standalone path

That means the current compiler is not inferring the simple numeric recursive
path from the function body and call graph alone.

Issue `#1124` now documents why: the current pipeline does not yet have a real
middle-end where this interprocedural recursive numeric inference can live
cleanly. This issue should therefore be treated as depending on that
architecture direction.

## Why it matters

This is a high-value benchmark and product-story issue:

- the landing-page Fibonacci story should not depend on JSDoc scaffolding
- simple recursive numeric code is a baseline inference case
- requiring type comments for such a small example weakens the claim that
  existing JavaScript can compile unchanged onto the fast path

## Goal

Preserve the current lean recursive numeric lowering for `fib-recursive.js`
without requiring JSDoc number hints on `fib` or `run`.

## Requirements

1. Infer the numeric parameter/return flow for trivial recursive numeric
   functions from body shape and call graph
2. Propagate that inference across the exported entrypoint and the recursive
   helper
3. Keep the recursive benchmark on the same small fast path currently reached
   with explicit number hints
4. Preserve correctness if the function body stops being provably numeric

## Acceptance criteria

- `benchmarks/competitive/programs/fib-recursive.js` works with no JSDoc type
  comments
- `js2wasm -> Node.js` returns the correct result for the benchmark
- `js2wasm -> Wasmtime` stays on the standalone path with no non-WASI import
  leakage
- emitted module size remains in the same small range as the annotated version,
  not the ~4 KB fallback shape
- benchmark timings remain close to the annotated fast-path result

## Notes

- Depends on `#1124`, which establishes the need for a new SSA/type-propagation
  middle-end and explicitly calls out inferring `fib(number) -> number` even
  when TypeScript leaves `fib` as implicit `any`
- This is separate from `#1120`, which targets the iterative `|0` int32 loop
  fast path
- This issue is about inference on a simple recursive numeric kernel, not
  explicit bitwise coercion
