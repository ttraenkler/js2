# #798b -- Catch variable unwrap

## Implementation summary

When a caught exception is stored in the catch variable, unwrap the externref payload correctly. Bundled with #798c (rethrow instruction) in a single commit. The catch variable now correctly holds the exception value whether it came from a Wasm `throw $tag` or a foreign JS exception via `catch_all`.
