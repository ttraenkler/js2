# Issue 21: Array Methods

## Status: done

> Superseded by #26

## Summary
Support common array instance methods: `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.forEach()`, `.indexOf()`, `.includes()`, `.join()`, `.length` (setter), `.splice()`.

## Motivation
Array methods are fundamental to TypeScript. Currently arrays support `[]` indexing, `.length` (getter), and `for...of` iteration, but no method calls.

## Design

### Tier 1: Mutating methods (no callbacks)
These can be implemented as WASM GC array operations:

- `.push(value)` → `array.new` with length+1, copy elements, set last (or use host import for simplicity)
- `.pop()` → return last element, shrink (requires host import since GC arrays are fixed-size)
- `.indexOf(value)` → loop + comparison
- `.includes(value)` → indexOf !== -1
- `.join(sep)` → host import, returns string

Since WASM GC arrays are fixed-length, mutating methods like `push`/`pop` need host-side backing (wrap in JS array) or a different representation.

### Tier 2: Higher-order methods (require callbacks)
Depends on issue #11 (arrow function callbacks):

- `.map(fn)` → create new array, loop and call callback for each element
- `.filter(fn)` → create new array, loop and conditionally include
- `.forEach(fn)` → loop and call callback
- `.reduce(fn, init)` → accumulator loop

### Approach: Host-imported array methods
For simplicity, all array methods become host imports. Arrays passed as externref to the host, which performs the operation natively.

Alternative: compile `.forEach`/`.map` inline (unroll the loop at compile time if callback is an arrow function).

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: detect method calls on array-typed receivers
- `src/codegen/index.ts`: collectArrayMethodImports
- `src/compiler.ts`: array method stubs in generateEnvImportLine
- Depends on: #11 for higher-order methods

## Complexity: L

## Acceptance criteria
- `arr.push(42)` adds element (via host)
- `arr.indexOf(x)` returns correct index
- `arr.map(x => x * 2)` creates new array (depends on #11)
- `arr.forEach(x => console.log(x))` iterates (depends on #11)
- `arr.join(", ")` returns concatenated string
