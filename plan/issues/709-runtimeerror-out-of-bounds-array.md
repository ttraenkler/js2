# #709 — RuntimeError: out of bounds array access (174 FAIL)

## Status: done

## Problem

174 tests fail at runtime with "out of bounds" array access errors. Multiple Array
prototype methods emit raw `array.get` without bounds checking, and index clamping
for negative/out-of-range indices is missing.

## Error signature

```
RuntimeError: out of bounds table access
RuntimeError: array element access out of bounds
```

## Root cause

Investigation revealed the actual root causes differed from the initial hypothesis:

1. **Array destructuring** already had bounds-checked `array.get` via `emitBoundsCheckedArrayGet`
   in both expressions.ts and statements.ts/index.ts.
2. **for-of iteration** was already loop-guarded with `i32.ge_s` + `br_if`.
3. The actual traps came from **Array prototype methods** (pop, shift, at, slice, splice,
   copyWithin, fill, lastIndexOf) that used raw `array.get`/`array.set` without guards.
4. **vec-to-tuple conversion** in type-coercion.ts also lacked bounds checks.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done

1. **compileArrayPop** (expressions.ts): Added `length > 0` guard. When empty, returns
   default value (0/NaN/null) instead of trapping on `data[length-1]`.

2. **compileArrayShift** (expressions.ts): Added `length > 0` guard. When empty, returns
   default value instead of trapping on `data[0]` and avoids `array.copy` with negative length.

3. **compileArrayAt** (expressions.ts): Replaced raw `array.get` with `emitBoundsCheckedArrayGet`
   to handle out-of-bounds indices after negative index adjustment.

4. **compileArraySlice** (expressions.ts): Added `emitClampIndex` for negative start/end
   indices and `emitClampNonNeg` to ensure sliceLen >= 0 before `array.new_default`.

5. **compileArraySplice** (expressions.ts): Added `emitClampIndex` for negative start,
   `emitClampNonNeg` for deleteCount, and clamped deleteCount to remaining elements.

6. **compileArrayCopyWithin** (expressions.ts): Added `emitClampIndex` for target, start,
   end indices and `emitClampNonNeg` for count.

7. **compileArrayFill** (expressions.ts): Added `emitClampIndex` for start/end indices.

8. **compileArrayLastIndexOf** (expressions.ts): Added proper `fromIndex` clamping with
   negative index handling and upper bound clamp to `length - 1`.

9. **emitVecToTupleBody** (type-coercion.ts): Added bounds-checked array reads so that
   vec-to-tuple conversion doesn't trap when the vec is shorter than the tuple.

### Helper functions added

- `emitClampIndex(fctx, idxLocal, lenLocal)`: Clamps negative indices using
  `idx = max(0, len + idx)` and upper-bounds to `len`.
- `emitClampNonNeg(fctx, local)`: Clamps value to >= 0.

### Files changed

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: Fixed 8 Array prototype methods, added 2 helper functions
- `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts`: Fixed vec-to-tuple bounds check
- `tests/array-oob-bounds-check.test.ts`: New test file verifying no OOB traps

### What worked

- All existing array tests continue to pass (no regressions)
- Pop/shift on non-empty arrays still work correctly
- Negative index handling in at(), slice(), copyWithin() works
- Slice with negative indices produces correct length

### What didn't change

- The 69 `ary-ptrn-elem-*` test262 failures are likely caused by arrow function
  parameter destructuring receiving JS externref arrays that fail `ref.cast_null`
  (illegal cast, not OOB). These are a separate issue from the Array method OOB traps.
- Some edge cases (array index 4294967295, setting length to 0 then accessing) are
  inherent to the WasmGC array model and would need a different approach.
