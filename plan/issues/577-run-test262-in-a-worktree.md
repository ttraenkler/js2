# #577 -- Run test262 in a worktree to avoid mid-run code changes

## Status: in-review
When the tech lead edits `src/codegen/*.ts` while a test262 run is in progress, the runner picks up the half-edited file and crashes (e.g., syntax error at `expressions.ts:166`). The compilation cache also becomes invalid mid-run.

## Approach

Before starting a test run, create a temporary git worktree:
```bash
git worktree add /tmp/ts2wasm-test262-run HEAD --detach
cd /tmp/ts2wasm-test262-run
npx tsx scripts/run-test262.ts --full
# copy results back to main worktree
git worktree remove /tmp/ts2wasm-test262-run
```

The test runner should:
1. Create a worktree at the current HEAD
2. Run all tests against that frozen snapshot
3. Copy results (JSONL, report, history) back to the main `benchmarks/results/`
4. Clean up the worktree

This ensures the compiler source is stable throughout the entire run, even if the tech lead is actively coding.

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added automatic worktree isolation to `scripts/run-test262.ts`. When the script is invoked normally, it:

1. Creates a temporary detached git worktree at HEAD in `/tmp/ts2wasm-test262-<timestamp>`
2. Symlinks `node_modules` and `test262` into the worktree (avoids copying large directories)
3. Symlinks `benchmarks/results` so results, cache, and previous JSONL are accessible
4. Copies the runner scripts (`run-test262.ts`, `test262-worker.ts`, `test262-runner.ts`) from the working tree into the worktree so uncommitted runner changes are picked up
5. Re-executes itself from the worktree with `--in-worktree <results-dir>` flag
6. Cleans up the worktree on completion, error, or signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM)

The compiler source (`src/`) comes from the git HEAD snapshot in the worktree, frozen for the entire run.

### Flags added
- `--no-worktree` -- skip worktree creation, run in-place (useful for CI)
- `--in-worktree <dir>` -- internal flag used by the re-exec, not for user invocation

### What worked
- Symlinked `node_modules` and `test262` to avoid copying hundreds of MB
- Used `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` to find the main repo root, supporting runs from agent worktrees where `test262`/`node_modules` may only exist at the original checkout
- Used the tsx CLI binary directly (not `node --import tsx`) because ESM bare-specifier resolution doesn't follow symlinked `node_modules` from `/tmp`
- Graceful fallback: if worktree setup fails, falls through to in-place execution

### What needed iteration
- ESM resolution doesn't follow symlinked `node_modules` from a different cwd -- had to use absolute path to tsx binary
- Empty directories left by `git worktree add` (e.g., empty `test262/` dir) had to be detected and replaced with symlinks to the real content
- The worktree gets HEAD's version of scripts, not working-tree changes, so runner scripts are copied over

### Files changed
- `scripts/run-test262.ts` -- added worktree isolation wrapper (~110 lines at top of file)
