# #1083 — Extras-forward call sites double-compile trailing arg expressions

## Problem

`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` has six call-site paths introduced by
#1053 (#96, commit a1ba0f23) that forward "extra" runtime args beyond the
callee's formal param count via the `__extras_argv` module global. All six
paths follow the same shape:

```ts
emitSetExtrasArgv(ctx, fctx, expr.arguments as unknown as ts.Expression[], paramCount);
for (let i = paramCount; i < expr.arguments.length; i++) {
  const extraType = compileExpression(ctx, fctx, expr.arguments[i]!);
  if (extraType !== null) {
    fctx.body.push({ op: "drop" });
  }
}
```

`emitSetExtrasArgv` already compiles each extra argument expression (to
build the externref vec stored in `__extras_argv`). The subsequent loop
then **compiles the same expressions again** and drops the results. The
second compile is dead code — its only purpose appears to be keeping the
surrounding call-site scaffolding aligned with the non-extras path, but
the generated `drop` instructions are not needed because the stack is
already balanced after the global.set.

## Why this matters

1. **Wasted codegen work** — each extra argument walks the TS AST twice,
   emits twice the Wasm instructions, and gets dropped. For a call with 5
   trailing extras this is 5× duplicated expression codegen per call site.

2. **Duplicate module registrations** — `compileExpression` for an
   expression like `foo()` (where `foo` is a closure) registers a closure
   struct type, possibly an import, and potentially a generic
   instantiation entry. Running it a second time can:
   - double-register non-idempotent module entries (invalid Wasm)
   - re-emit type-index-sensitive sequences that were already emitted once
   - produce invalid stack shapes if the second compile's result type
     differs from the first (e.g. generic resolution changed mid-compile)

3. **Invalid-wasm failure mode, not compile-time error** — the failure
   surfaces only at `WebAssembly.instantiate` time (or later, if the
   invalid section is lazily validated). No compile-time diagnostic
   catches this.

## Fix sketch

Delete the trailing `for` loop in all six call sites. The `emitSetExtrasArgv`
call already consumes the extra argument expressions, leaves the stack
balanced, and stores the result in the module global. The only reason to
keep the loop would be if a call-site layer above expected the trailing
args on the Wasm stack — they don't, because the parent emits a call with
`formalCount` args, not `actualCount` args.

**Verify first**: grep for patterns like
`"arguments": expr.arguments.length > paramCount"` in calls.ts to confirm
no downstream code reads a trailing-arg side effect before deleting the
loop. If any side effect is required, replace the second compile with an
empty-body pass that just preserves source positions for source maps.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] All six `emitSetExtrasArgv`-followed-by-recompile sites in calls.ts
      collapsed to a single `emitSetExtrasArgv` call each.
- [ ] `tests/issue-1053.test.ts` still passes 9/9.
- [ ] Equivalence test suite unchanged.
- [ ] No new test262 regressions.

## Relationship

- Latent bug introduced by #96 (commit a1ba0f23). Discovered during the
  2026-04-11 #96 self-audit conducted as part of the #1080 CI baseline
  drift investigation. Orthogonal to the baseline drift — this is a
  correctness/performance bug, not the cause of the regression gate issue.

## Risks

- If any of the six paths relies on the recompile for a side effect we
  haven't identified, removing it could break a narrow class of inputs.
  Mitigation: keep the test suite as the safety net; add a targeted test
  for any side effect that gets flagged during implementation review.

## Investigation (2026-04-17)

**Finding: false positive.** All 7 `emitSetExtrasArgv` call sites in `calls.ts`
(lines 2762, 3131, 3210, 3264, 3346, 3402, 4664) use an if/else pattern:

```ts
if (calleeReadsArgs*) {
  emitSetExtrasArgv(ctx, fctx, expr.arguments, paramCount);
} else {
  for (let i = paramCount; i < expr.arguments.length; i++) {
    const extraType = compileExpression(ctx, fctx, expr.arguments[i]!);
    if (extraType !== null) { fctx.body.push({ op: "drop" }); }
  }
}
```

The `emitSetExtrasArgv` call and the compile+drop for-loop are **mutually exclusive
branches**, not sequential. The for-loop is the fallback path for functions that
do NOT read `arguments` — it evaluates extra args for side effects and drops the
results. This is correct JS semantics: `foo(a, b, sideEffect())` must evaluate
`sideEffect()` even if `foo` only declares two parameters.

Verified against the original commit a1ba0f23 (#1053) — the if/else pattern was
introduced from day one. The issue description incorrectly claims they run
sequentially.
