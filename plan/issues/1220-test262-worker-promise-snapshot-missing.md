# #1220 — test262-worker: Promise snapshot + prototype cleanup gaps (+29 tests)

## Problem

Two test isolation bugs in `scripts/test262-worker.mjs` cause 29 tests to fail
in shared fork workers even though the compiler output is correct.

### Bug A — Promise not snapshotted (26 tests)

`_STATIC_SNAPSHOTS` (line ~211) restores mutated static methods between tests for
`Array`, `Object`, `String`, `Number`, `Math`, `JSON`, `Reflect`, `RegExp` — but
NOT `Promise`. Tests that mutate `Promise.resolve = function(...) {...}` and never
restore it poison all subsequent tests in the same fork that call `Promise.all`,
`Promise.race`, etc. internally.

Error: `L46:3 Promise.resolve is not a function`

### Bug B — Number/TypedArray/Iterator prototype poisoning (3 tests)

Tests that set non-configurable properties on `Number.prototype.next`,
`TypedArray.prototype.length`, or `Iterator.prototype.next` leak those properties
into subsequent tests in the same fork, which then fail with
`Cannot redefine property: next` / `Cannot redefine property: length`.

## Fix

### Bug A (1 line in `scripts/test262-worker.mjs`)

Add to `_STATIC_SNAPSHOTS`:
```js
["Promise", Promise, ["resolve", "reject", "all", "allSettled", "any", "race"]],
```
The existing `_restoreMethodProp` machinery handles restoration automatically.

### Bug B (~30 LOC in `scripts/test262-worker.mjs`)

After each test in the fork cleanup step, delete any extra own properties added to:
- `Number.prototype`
- `%TypedArray%.prototype`  
- `Iterator.prototype`

Use `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` to diff against the known baseline and delete additions.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The 26 Promise-related tests no longer fail with "Promise.resolve is not a function"
  when run in the same shard as a test that mutates Promise.resolve
- [ ] The 3 "Cannot redefine property" isolation tests pass
- [ ] No regression in the existing _STATIC_SNAPSHOTS tests (Array, Object, etc.)
- [ ] Changes confined to `scripts/test262-worker.mjs` only

## Out of scope

- Pattern 2B (instanceof TypeError unwrap — 10 tests): real compiler bug, defer to S47
- Pattern 2C (mapped arguments Cannot redefine — 9 tests): separate issue, real compiler bug
