# node:http (+ https) — GET round-trip host import (axios unblocker)

## Problem

axios (#1032, high priority) is the highest-value real-world target on the
backlog and it requires `node:http`/`node:https`. Today both are the opaque
`__node_http` / `__node_https` externref imports: `http.createServer` /
`http.get` lower through `__extern_method_call`, but the response is an
`EventEmitter` stream the compiled code cannot consume (no first-class
EventEmitter — see #1794) and bodies are `Buffer`s the compiled code cannot
unpack (no first-class Buffer — see #1793).

## Acceptance criteria

Tier 0 (JS-host target) — a single GET → string round-trip:

```ts
import { get } from "node:http";
function fetchText(url: string, cb: (s: string) => void): void {
  get(url, (res) => {
    let body = "";
    res.on("data", (chunk: any) => {
      body += chunk.toString();
    });
    res.on("end", () => cb(body));
  });
}
```

- Compiles, instantiates, and against a localhost test server returns the
  served body string through `cb`.
- `import { get } from "node:https"` resolves the same way (TLS plumbing is the
  host's; no extra Wasm surface).

## Implementation approach

1. **Depends on #1793 (Buffer) and #1794 (EventEmitter)** — the response
   `.on("data", chunk => chunk.toString())` chain needs both. Land those first.
2. Wire `http.get` / `http.request` as host imports that return an
   EventEmitter-shaped response object (reusing the #1794 callback contract).
3. This is the natural place to land the **bidirectional host-import
   contract**: Wasm passes a request descriptor out, host returns a response
   stream, Wasm reads via EventEmitter.
4. `createServer` and the full IncomingMessage/ServerResponse class surface are
   out of scope for Tier 0 (client GET only).
5. Standalone HTTP belongs to #640 (wasi:http/incoming-handler) — out of scope
   here; browser fetch is the parallel #1500 track.

## Test

`tests/issue-1795.test.ts` — spin up a localhost server, compile the Tier 0
`fetchText`, assert the returned body. Gate behind #1793 + #1794 landing.

## Implementation (2026-07-17, fable-s2)

- `NODE_BUILTIN_FN_TYPED_STUBS` (import-resolver.ts) gains `http`/`https`
  `get` + `request` — `__nodefn__http__get` → `require("http").get` via the
  existing `node_builtin_fn` intent.
- `makeNodeBuiltinFnAdapter` (runtime.ts) wraps wasm-closure args as JS
  callables via the identity-cached `_maybeWrapCallableUnknownArity` bridge
  (Node either threw on or ignored the raw struct).
- The response `res: any` externref's `.on(...)` listeners classify as
  DEFERRED via the new any-receiver listener-name fallback
  (callback-classification.ts) — no type symbol to key the per-class
  allowlist on.
- **#3329 fixed en route** (blocking: the acceptance shape shares `body`
  between the `data` and `end` listeners): deferred callbacks now get the
  needsThis-style `localMap` rebind, so sibling stored callbacks alias ONE
  ref cell.

## Test Results

- `tests/issue-1795.test.ts`: 3/3 — acceptance shape end-to-end against a
  localhost server ("hello-1795" through the cb param), multi-chunk
  accumulation (part1-part2-part3), https binding-liveness.
- `tests/issue-1794.test.ts` multi-listener test upgraded to the SHARED
  accumulator (33) per #3329 acceptance; 5/5.
- Sweep: issue-1695, issue-2861, issue-2128, issue-3051, issue-2029,
  issue-859, issue-929 — all pass.
- Buffer round-trip note: `chunk.toString()` rides #1793 (landed); the
  EventEmitter contract rides #1794 (same PR stack).
