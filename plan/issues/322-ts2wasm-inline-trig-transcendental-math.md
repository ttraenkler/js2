# [ts2wasm] Inline trig/transcendental Math methods as pure Wasm

## Summary

Replace host imports for `Math.sin`, `Math.cos`, `Math.exp`, `Math.log`, etc. with pure Wasm polynomial approximations, eliminating JS host dependency for all Math methods except `Math.random`.

## Motivation

Aligns with the project's core principle: **never delegate to JS host**. Currently 16 one-arg and 2 two-arg Math methods are host-imported. All are implementable as pure Wasm using well-known numerical algorithms.

## Methods to inline

### Already native Wasm opcodes (no work needed)
`abs`, `neg`, `ceil`, `floor`, `trunc`, `nearest`, `sqrt`, `min`, `max`, `copysign`, `clz`

### Phase 1: Core functions (others derive from these)
- `sin`, `cos` — range reduction + minimax polynomial (fdlibm/musl approach)
- `exp`, `log` — range reduction + polynomial
- `atan` — polynomial approximation

### Phase 2: Derived functions
- `tan` — `sin/cos`
- `asin`, `acos` — derived from `atan` + `sqrt`
- `atan2` — `atan` with quadrant handling
- `log2`, `log10` — `log(x) * LOG2E` / `log(x) * LOG10E`
- `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh` — from `exp`
- `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh` — from `log` + `sqrt`
- `cbrt` — Newton's method seeded with `sqrt`
- `pow` — `exp(y * log(x))` with integer fast path
- `expm1`, `log1p` — numerically stable variants
- `hypot` — `sqrt(x*x + y*y)` with overflow protection

### Must remain host import
- `random` — requires entropy source

## Implementation approach

Emit each method as a Wasm function (not inlined at every call site). Reference implementations: musl libc (`src/math/`), fdlibm, or CORE-MATH. Target precision: within 1-2 ULP of IEEE 754.

## Priority

Low — host imports work correctly once #321 is fixed. This is a purity/independence improvement, not a correctness fix.

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `sin`/`cos` with range reduction + polynomial
- [ ] Implement `exp`/`log`
- [ ] Implement `atan`
- [ ] Derive remaining functions from Phase 1 primitives
- [ ] Add precision tests against JS `Math.*` for edge cases (0, pi, -0, Infinity, NaN, denormals)
- [ ] Remove corresponding host imports
- [ ] Keep `Math.random` as sole remaining Math host import
