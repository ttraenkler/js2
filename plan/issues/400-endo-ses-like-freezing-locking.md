# #400 -- Endo/SES-like freezing/locking of insecure language features

## Status: backlog

## Summary

Add compile-time hardening inspired by [Endo/SES (Secure ECMAScript)](https://github.com/endojs/endo) to eliminate insecure language features from compiled Wasm output. Since ts2wasm controls the entire compilation pipeline, dangerous patterns can be statically rejected or neutralized rather than requiring runtime lockdown.

## Motivation

Wasm modules compiled from untrusted TypeScript should not be able to:
- Escape the sandbox via eval, Function constructor, or dynamic code generation
- Pollute shared state via prototype mutation
- Exfiltrate data via covert channels (timing, error messages)
- Access ambient authority (globalThis, import(), document, etc.)

SES achieves this at runtime by freezing intrinsics and restricting eval. ts2wasm can do better by rejecting these patterns at compile time — zero runtime overhead.

## Scope

### Phase 1: Static rejection of dangerous patterns
- `eval()` and `new Function()` — compile error (already partially skipped)
- `with` statement — compile error (already skipped)
- Dynamic `import()` — compile error
- `document`, `window`, `navigator` — compile error unless explicitly declared
- `__proto__` assignment — compile error or no-op

### Phase 2: Intrinsic lockdown
- `Object.prototype` mutation — reject at compile time
- `Array.prototype` mutation — reject at compile time
- `Function.prototype` access — restrict to .name/.length/.call/.apply
- `Object.setPrototypeOf` — currently stubbed as no-op, keep it that way
- `Object.defineProperty` — currently won't-implement, enforce

### Phase 3: Compartment-like isolation
- Per-module globalThis (already the case — no shared global)
- No cross-module prototype pollution (structs are isolated by design)
- Compile-time capability checking — modules declare what host APIs they need
- Import allowlists — only declared imports are permitted

### Phase 4: Optional strict mode
- Compiler flag `--hardened` to enable all restrictions
- Default: permissive (current behavior)
- Hardened mode: reject all Phase 1-3 patterns as compile errors
- Report: list of security-relevant patterns found in source

## Design notes

ts2wasm has a natural advantage over SES: WasmGC structs are not JS objects, so there are no prototype chains to freeze. The struct-based object model is inherently more secure than JS objects. Key areas where security matters:

1. **Host imports** — the `src/runtime.ts` bridge is the attack surface. Hardened mode should minimize host imports and audit each one.
2. **externref escape hatch** — values boxed to externref flow through JS host, potentially exposing capabilities. Hardened mode should restrict externref usage.
3. **String operations** — currently delegated to host. Pure Wasm string ops (already the goal) eliminate this vector.

## Complexity: L (phased)

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Phase 1: eval/Function/with/import() are compile errors
- [ ] Phase 2: Prototype mutation is rejected
- [ ] Phase 3: Per-module isolation is enforced
- [ ] Phase 4: `--hardened` flag gates all restrictions
