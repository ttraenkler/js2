# #1225 — Nested destructuring from null/undefined: missing TypeError

## Problem

~244 test262 tests in `for-of/dstr`, `assignment/dstr`, and `class/dstr` expect
TypeError to be thrown when a nested destructuring pattern encounters `null` or
`undefined`, but our compiler doesn't throw.

These are **not** the same as #1224 (which is about the guard firing too EARLY,
before a default is applied). Issue #1225 is about the guard NOT firing when
it SHOULD.

## Failing patterns

### Pattern 1 — for-of assignment with nested null element (~126 tests)

```js
var x;
assert.throws(TypeError, function() {
  for ([{ x }] of [[null]]) {}  // inner element is null → should throw
});
```

The for-of iterates `[[null]]`, yielding `[null]`. Then `[{ x }]` destructures
`[null]`: first element is `null`. Then `{ x }` destructures from `null` →
spec-required TypeError.

### Pattern 2 — assignment destructuring with nested null (~26 tests)

```js
var _;
assert.throws(TypeError, function() {
  0, [[ _ ]] = [null];  // [_] = null → should throw
});
```

Outer pattern `[[_]]` over `[null]`: first element is `null`. Inner `[_]` tries
to iterate `null` → TypeError.

### Pattern 3 — class method with nested null initializer (~92 tests)

```js
var C = class {
  *method({ w: { x, y, z } = undefined } = { }) {}
};
assert.throws(TypeError, function() {
  c.method();  // w=undefined, initializer=undefined, then {x,y,z}=undefined → TypeError
});
```

1. No arg → param defaults to `{}`
2. Extract `w` from `{}` → `undefined`
3. Apply initializer `= undefined` → still `undefined`
4. Destructure `{ x, y, z }` from `undefined` → TypeError

The third step is key: after applying an initializer that evaluates to
`undefined`, the code does NOT re-check if the value is still undefined
before proceeding to destructure the nested pattern.

## Root cause

In nested destructuring, the null/undefined guard is not applied uniformly:

1. **For-of assignment path** (`compileForOfAssignDestructuringExternref` in
   `statements/loops.ts`): when an extracted element is passed to the nested
   pattern compilation, the null guard might not be emitted for the nested call.

2. **Assignment nested path** (`emitArrayDestructureFromLocal` in
   `expressions/assignment.ts` around line 1510): the function calls
   `emitExternrefAssignDestructureGuard` for externref sources. But the
   nested element extracted from an outer vec might have type `externref` (null
   encoded as ref.null.extern) and the guard might not be reached when the
   outer vec is compiled as a typed WasmGC array.

3. **Class method / generator method param path** (`destructuring-params.ts`):
   after applying an initializer that evaluates to `undefined`, if the
   initializer expression returns `undefined` (or ref.null.extern), the
   subsequent nested pattern destructuring must re-check for null/undefined
   and throw. The post-initializer check is missing.

## Fix plan

### Step 1: Reproduce each pattern

Write `tests/issue-1225.test.ts` with all three patterns and confirm they fail
before the fix.

### Step 2: For-of nested null (Pattern 1)

In `compileForOfAssignDestructuringExternref` (loops.ts ~line 1490), when
yielding each element from the iterator and handing it to the nested pattern
destructuring function, ensure the null/undefined guard is emitted for the
nested element BEFORE passing it to the nested destructuring compilation.

Look for the call site where the iterator element is extracted and passed to
a nested object/array destructuring function. Add `emitExternrefAssignDestructureGuard`
if missing.

### Step 3: Assignment nested null (Pattern 2)

In `emitArrayDestructureFromLocal` (assignment.ts ~line 1501), check the
code path for externref elements. When element i is extracted from a WasmGC
array and the element's type is externref, ensure the nested destructuring
call emits the null guard.

Look at what happens when the element is passed to a recursive/nested
destructuring call for array or object patterns.

### Step 4: Class method nested initializer evaluating to undefined (Pattern 3)

In `destructuring-params.ts` (the function that handles parameter destructuring
with initializers), after emitting the initializer expression and checking if
the value was `undefined` (to decide whether to apply the initializer), if the
initializer ITSELF returns `undefined` (or null), the code must emit the
null/undefined guard AGAIN before proceeding to destructure the nested pattern.

Look for the code path:
1. Value is undefined → apply initializer
2. Initializer result is STILL undefined
3. → guard should fire for the nested pattern

Specifically: the `if (value === undefined) value = initializerExpr` substitution
returns `undefined` as the new value. The subsequent nested pattern must see
this as null/undefined and throw.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `tests/issue-1225.test.ts` covers all 3 patterns and passes
2. At least 200 of the ~244 failing tests pass
3. No regression in tests that correctly pass `null` through destructuring
   when there IS a working default (different from #1225 which has no default
   or a default that evaluates to null/undefined)
4. No regression in #1224's acceptance criteria

## Test cases

```js
// Pattern 1: for-of with nested null
var x;
let threw = false;
try { for ([{ x }] of [[null]]) {} } catch (e) { threw = e instanceof TypeError; }
assert(threw); // must throw TypeError

// Pattern 2: assignment nested null
var _;
try { [[ _ ]] = [null]; } catch (e) { assert(e instanceof TypeError); }

// Pattern 3: class method nested undefined initializer
class C { *method({ w: { x, y, z } = undefined } = {}) {} }
try { new C().method(); } catch (e) { assert(e instanceof TypeError); }

// Regression guard: valid nested destructuring must still work
var [[ a ]] = [[1]];
assert.strictEqual(a, 1);

var [{ b }] = [{ b: 42 }];
assert.strictEqual(b, 42);
```
