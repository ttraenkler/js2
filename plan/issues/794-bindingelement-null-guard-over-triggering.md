# #794 -- BindingElement null guard over-triggering in destructuring (537 fail)

## Problem

537 tests fail with "TypeError (null/undefined access)" during destructuring:
- 381 "BindingElement with array binding pattern and initializer"
- 156 "BindingElement with object binding pattern and initializer"

The null guard system throws TypeError on valid values that are a different struct type than expected, same root cause as #792 but in destructuring-specific paths.

## Fix approach

In destructuring codegen, the null check before accessing struct fields should use `ref.is_null` (genuine null only), not `ref.test $Struct` (which fails for different struct types). The #792 multi-struct dispatch fix addressed this for property access but not for destructuring.

## Files to modify

- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — array/object destructuring variable declarations
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — destructureParamArray, destructureParamObject
