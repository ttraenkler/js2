# #1074 — Surface ESM `export default` as a named Wasm function export

## Problem

When `compileProject` is pointed at an ESM module whose only export is a
default — e.g. `lodash-es/identity.js`:

```js
function identity(value) { return value; }
export default identity;
```

the emitted Wasm binary is 102 bytes and contains **zero function exports**.
The `export default` declaration is parsed by TypeScript and the source file
is fed through codegen, but the default binding is not surfaced into the Wasm
module's exports table.

This blocks every npm library whose public API is shaped as
`export default <fn>` — including every `lodash-es/<fn>.js` file, most
single-function utilities (`ms`, `mitt`, `nanoid` single-purpose exports),
and most React component modules.

## Evidence

From `tests/stress/lodash-tier1.test.ts` (the #1031 stress harness):

```ts
runIfInstalled(
  "compileProject on ESM lodash-es/identity.js: `export default` not emitted as Wasm export",
  () => {
    const result = compileProject("node_modules/lodash-es/identity.js", { allowJs: true });
    const mod = new WebAssembly.Module(result.binary);
    const funcExports = WebAssembly.Module.exports(mod).filter((e) => e.kind === "function");
    expect(funcExports).toEqual([]);  // current broken behavior, will flip
  },
);
```

102-byte binary = minimal Wasm envelope, no user code. Codegen is recognizing
the module has no reachable exports and emitting nothing.

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§16.2.3.6 Runtime Semantics: Evaluation — ExportDeclaration](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-exports-runtime-semantics-evaluation) — `export default expr` creates a binding named "default"
- [§16.2.1.6 ModuleDeclarationLinking](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-moduledeclarationlinking) — links export names to module namespace object


## Root cause hypothesis

The Wasm export collection pass walks named exports (`export function foo`,
`export { bar }`) but does not treat `export default <ident>` as a named
export. The default binding should be surfaced as either:

- **Option A**: `default` export name — the Wasm export is literally named
  `default` (matches the ESM semantics).
- **Option B**: `<filename>` export name — the default is re-exported under
  a derived name (e.g. `identity` for `lodash-es/identity.js`).

Option A is more spec-correct but awkward from a JS host that wants to do
`instance.exports.default(x)` — "default" is a reserved-ish word. Option B
is ergonomic but requires filename-based derivation logic. The TypeScript
compiler already knows the declaration name bound to the default — use that.

**Recommended**: Option C — export the default under BOTH its declaration
name (`identity`) AND the literal name `default`, so either invocation path
works. Only emit both if the declaration has a name; for anonymous
`export default function() {}`, fall back to `default` only.

## Scope

1. Identify where Wasm exports are collected — likely in
   `src/codegen/index.ts` or a `collectExports` helper.
2. Walk the source file's `ExportAssignment` nodes (TS AST for `export default`
   or `export = `) and resolve the bound declaration.
3. If the binding resolves to a named function or class, emit it under both
   names; if anonymous, emit as `default` only.
4. For `export = identity` (legacy CJS-compatible form), treat identically.
5. Add tests against `lodash-es/identity.js` (one-liner default), an anonymous
   default function, and a named-class default.
6. Verify `compileProject("node_modules/lodash-es/identity.js")` produces a
   module with at least one callable function export, and invoking it round-
   trips a value.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `compileProject` on any ESM file whose API is `export default fn` emits
      at least one Wasm function export.
- [ ] The #1031 stress test assertion for `lodash-es/identity.js` flips from
      "no exports" to "identity(x) === x for x in sample values".
- [ ] Existing named-export tests still pass.
- [ ] Anonymous `export default function() {...}` exports under the name
      `default`.
- [ ] Named `export default identity` exports under both `identity` and
      `default`.

## Non-goals

- **CJS `module.exports = fn`** — separate issue (#1075).
- **Re-exports** (`export { default } from './other'`) — covered once the
  primary default export works, but may need a follow-up.
- **Changing the ESM parsing path** — TypeScript already parses this
  correctly; the gap is in the Wasm export collector.

## Relationship to #1031

- **#1074** is the third prerequisite for the #1031 Tier 1 lodash demo.
  #1060 (ModuleResolver) and #1061 (allowJs forwarding) resolve the module
  graph correctly, #1062 and #1063 fix codegen bugs that prevent the output
  from validating, and **#1074** surfaces the exports so the host can
  actually invoke them.
- Without #1074, even fully-fixed codegen produces a Wasm module that the
  host cannot call into — it's "compiles" without "runnable".

## Notes

- This gap surfaced via the #1031 stress test, which is exactly what the
  stress tests are for.
- Should be straightforward once the export collector is located — the TS
  AST walk is a few lines, and the Wasm export-emit side just needs a new
  entry.
