# #4376 — v8x + js2wasm as an engine-free Deno substrate

## Objective

Determine whether js2wasm can sit behind v8x's `rusty_v8`-compatible Rust API
so that:

1. Deno-facing code continues to call the API it already knows;
2. raw TypeScript module graphs retain their type information and compile
   directly to WasmGC rather than being transpiled to JavaScript;
3. Wasmtime executes the result without V8, JavaScriptCore, or QuickJS; and
4. a deployed artifact can run without shipping the js2wasm compiler.

The spike deliberately asks the compatibility question before trying to expose
Deno APIs as a new WASI world. Deno's Rust/JavaScript boundary is an object,
module, promise, and callback protocol, not a filesystem-style syscall API.

## Architecture verdict

The approach is viable as a staged architecture, but the spike is not yet a
portable Deno runtime.

```text
build time
  application .ts + Deno wrappers + op manifest
                   |
                   v
          js2wasm --platform deno
                   |
                   v
             linked WasmGC

run time
  deno_core / Rust host calls rusty_v8 API
                   |
                   v
          v8x compatibility layer
                   |
                   v
 shared Engine + Module + Linker + InstancePre
                   |
                   v
       private store + instance per module
                   |
                   v
       compiled wrappers call typed host ops
```

The first internal ABI should use ordinary typed Wasm imports. WIT/component
interfaces can describe the stable outer runtime boundary later, and WASI can
provide standard capabilities such as files, clocks, and sockets. Neither
WASI nor the Component Model replaces the JavaScript object graph that
`deno_core` and its wrappers share.

## What the spike implements

The patch in `examples/v8x-js2wasm-spike/v8x-js2wasm.patch` targets v8x
`v149.4.0-rc.4` at commit
`22cf7342405794d6e1cd851aa43a9b3447654742` and adds an opt-in
`engine_js2wasm` backend.

The implemented vertical slice provides Rust-owned:

- platform and isolate startup;
- contexts, Unicode strings, handles, and persistent handles;
- function/object templates and basic object/property storage;
- module compilation, resolver callbacks, graph instantiation, and evaluation
  promises; and
- exception values plus the complete simdutf compatibility surface.

The module path gathers untouched `.ts` sources through v8x's existing module
resolver, passes the linked graph to js2wasm with `platform: "deno"`, and
precompiles the WasmGC result for embedded Wasmtime 47.0.3. Production v8x
shares one compiler-free Engine and direct-Rust host Linker, caches one
Module/InstancePre per trusted artifact, and gives every evaluated module a
private store/instance that remains alive with its v8x module handle.

The integration fixture enters through the public `rusty_v8` API, evaluates a
typed three-module graph, and calls a Rust-owned `Deno.cwd()` implementation
through two primitive `v8x:deno` imports. It verifies the returned UTF-16
length and checksum against the host working directory and rejects a vacuous
result if no host op was called.

The test binary links neither JSC nor QuickJS. On macOS, `otool -L` reports
only `/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib`.

## Unchanged `deno_core` probe

The consumer probe uses Deno commit
`1d4e6c1cb855b62a7fb572c6c138e4e8b4e7fa44` (Deno 2.9.2,
`deno_core` 0.407.0) and replaces only its workspace `v8` dependency:

```toml
v8 = { package = "v8x", path = "/path/to/v8x", default-features = false, features = ["simdutf", "engine_js2wasm", "js2wasm_runtime_compile", "js2wasm_diagnostic_abi"] }
```

No `deno_core`, `serde_v8`, or Deno JavaScript/TypeScript wrapper source is
patched. All Rust source compiles successfully against the new backend with
the Wasmtime dependency graph resolved in the probe lockfile.

A strict normal link now succeeds through an opt-in diagnostic ABI feature.
That feature supplies weak, fail-loud definitions for the exact 237 symbols
referenced by the pinned executable; every unimplemented call prints its exact
symbol and aborts. Strong backend implementations override those definitions.
This is an execution instrument, not a supported deployment configuration and
not evidence that the remaining functions have semantics.

The strict unchanged executable now initializes the platform and isolate,
installs Deno's callbacks and initial `Deno.core` object graph, evaluates the
exact pinned wrapper/module/application sequence, and exits successfully. The
module trace enumerates exactly nine `v8x:deno` scalar bridge imports and seven
deferred Promise/eval imports. The nine Deno imports bind to real Rust host ops;
the seven deferred imports are prelinked but are not executed by this path.

Running the unchanged pinned `deno_core` `hello_world` example against the
precompiled artifact exits 0 and prints exactly:

```text
The sum of
1,2,3
is
6
Exception:
TypeError: serde_v8 error: invalid type; expected: array, got: Number
```

This retires the diagnostic bootstrap stop for the exact program. It is a
value-level vertical slice, not evidence that unexecuted Deno APIs or the
remaining diagnostic ABI have semantics.

### Primordials boundary

`00_primordials.js` captures trusted copies of JavaScript built-ins such as
`Object`, `Array`, `Promise`, and `Reflect` before application code can
monkey-patch them. Deno's later wrappers use those private copies for stable
internal behavior. Primordials are therefore JavaScript object identities and
functions, not Rust ops and not WASI calls.

The compiler adapter had previously
omitted side-effect JavaScript imports because it did not set `allowJs`; fixing
that exposed and then fixed two honest compiler boundaries:

1. #4378 lowers the exact pristine
   `Reflect.getPrototypeOf(Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]())` capture through
   the native empty-array iterator and returns the genuine shared iterator
   prototype.
2. #4380 makes empty-object widening inspect arrow/function-expression IIFE
   bodies, preventing `primordials` from becoming a null carrier during the
   first property write.

The exact pinned `00_primordials.js`, `00_infra.js`, `02_timers.js`,
`01_core.js`, `mod.js`, and `hello_world_usage.js` sources now compile as one
state-sharing standalone/`deno` program. The raw artifact is 3,975,227 bytes
on the measured Darwin arm64 producer, with SHA-256
`452d485bd70d7cb8d5d7958e0aebfddf71463a8cb9710de56dffc9ff23f50e85`.
Raw Wasm layout is producer-platform-specific: the Linux x64 CI producer emits
the same byte count and passes the same value checks with SHA-256
`0738f4ca2b8852ee7262bd306efb70754dc4c7d5532288af2b16f46caca0eeda`.
The regression test therefore pins the six source hashes, graph shape, imports,
size, and behavior rather than one platform's raw-artifact digest.
Target-gated standardized `try_table` lowering lets Wasmtime 47.0.3 precompile
it to a distinct 62,035,464-byte target-specific artifact with SHA-256
`05b75d7f1e46f92565c42e5a8a3e336983e7e2b0eecfe4889dadab9075988a5a`.
The ignored precompile/bootstrap test passes 1/1 in 500.49 seconds.

The Node-side import emulator boots the raw module in two isolated stores.
Both stores advance through wrapper/module/usage values `42`/`43`/`44`, commit
exactly two sum transactions and six UTF-16 print transactions, reproduce the
exact serde `TypeError` and six output strings, and call none of the seven
deferred Promise/eval imports. The strict v8x follow-up recognizes the same six
pinned source hashes and order through the public `rusty_v8` lifecycle, loads
the precompiled artifact, binds the nine scalar imports to Rust, and completes
the unchanged `deno_core` example. General Rust/Wasm object identity, module
live bindings, and asynchronous op semantics remain separate work.

## What “306 ABI symbols” meant

The initial unchanged-`deno_core` link reported 306 distinct unresolved
symbols in the v8/inspector/shared-handle ABI. This number was a linker
inventory, not 306 missing Deno APIs and not 306 equally important runtime
features. It included:

- symbols needed immediately during startup;
- symbols referenced by compiled Rust code but not executed by this probe;
- overloads and lifecycle helpers representing one semantic operation; and
- inspector/debugger paths unrelated to a minimal production runtime.

The spike implements 106 distinct `v8__*` functions, 10 shared-pointer
compatibility functions, and all 43 simdutf functions. The current diagnostic
layer provides 237 exact weak, fail-loud definitions for functions referenced
by the pinned executable but not yet implemented strongly. None is executed by
the successful exact `hello_world` path. The useful progress measure is
observable behavior through the real host bridge, not trying to drive an
inventory to zero with empty stubs.

## Compiler-free deployment answer

Yes: after build-time compilation and Wasmtime precompilation, the deployed
runtime needs only the target-specific trusted `.cwasm` artifact, the Rust/v8x
host layer, and compiler-free embedded Wasmtime. It does not need js2wasm,
Node, Cranelift, or a JavaScript engine.

The spike now proves this explicitly: one test saves the linked Wasm artifact,
and a second invocation evaluates it while the configured compiler path is
`/compiler-is-not-installed`. The production `deno` target must still package
the application, real Deno wrappers, and generated op manifest as that one
ahead-of-time linked program.

## Compile-time cost

The compatibility analyses increase the deterministic #3437 harness traversal
count from 111,568 to 131,133 (+17.5%). This exceeds the prior 15% ceiling, so
the dedicated harness budget is intentionally rebanked with the repository's
provided update command. A follow-up should consolidate the added per-file
scans; this PR accepts the measured compile-time cost for the prototype rather
than hiding it behind a looser percentage margin.

## Spike acceptance

- [x] Preserve raw TypeScript source and use its types during js2wasm
      compilation; do not transpile it to JavaScript first.
- [x] Enter through v8x's public `rusty_v8` module lifecycle.
- [x] Compile and evaluate a linked multi-file graph in Wasmtime without JSC
      or QuickJS.
- [x] Resolve canonical `file:` imports to compileMulti's virtual filesystem
      identity, including incremental compilation (#4377).
- [x] Compile unchanged `deno_core` Rust source against `engine_js2wasm`.
- [x] Advance the diagnostic startup path through `Deno.core`, the exact pinned
      wrapper/module/application sequence, and the six-line `hello_world`
      result from unchanged Rust `deno_core`.
- [x] Keep unimplemented ABI paths fail-loud instead of adding success-shaped
      no-op stubs.
- [x] State the compiler-free deployment shape and the current sidecar
      limitation separately.

## Follow-up acceptance

- [x] Embed Wasmtime, share the Engine/Linker/precompiled Module/InstancePre,
      and keep one isolated store/instance alive per v8x module runtime.
- [x] Compile all six exact pinned wrapper/module/application sources as one
      state-sharing program and prove stages `42`/`43`/`44` in two isolated
      instances.
- [x] Add `02_timers.js`, `mod.js`, and the exact `hello_world_usage.js`
      application to that state-sharing program.
- [x] Bind a first Rust op (`Deno.cwd()`) through explicit typed imports.
- [x] Bind the exact `op_sum`/`op_print` scalar bridge, including the serde
      `TypeError` and UTF-16 output semantics.
- [ ] Generate the broader Rust op table and preserve general exception,
      promise, and microtask ordering across the bridge.
- [ ] Return module namespaces and live bindings through the v8x handles.
- [ ] Add dynamic imports, top-level await, synthetic modules, and non-`file:`
      specifier handling as demanded by executed Deno paths.
- [x] Save and run a proof artifact without the compiler sidecar or Node.
- [x] Include JavaScript side-effect modules in the virtual graph and compile
      the pinned unchanged `00_primordials.js` through its first two compiler
      boundaries (#4378, #4380).
- [x] Emit standardized `try_table` EH so the exact wrapper artifact loads in
      v8x's embedded Wasmtime (#2997).
- [x] Route the pinned wrapper/module/application sequence through v8x's public
      `rusty_v8` lifecycle and real Rust host imports.
- [x] Prove the same path from the unchanged pinned Rust `deno_core`
      `hello_world` executable with exact output and exit status.
- [ ] Replace the narrow scalar/callback bridge with general shared
      object/function identity.
- [ ] Package the real Deno wrapper/application artifact for distribution.

The current Darwin arm64 six-source raw bootstrap artifact is 3,975,227 bytes with SHA-256
`452d485bd70d7cb8d5d7958e0aebfddf71463a8cb9710de56dffc9ff23f50e85`.
Linux x64 CI emits the same byte count and semantic result with SHA-256
`0738f4ca2b8852ee7262bd306efb70754dc4c7d5532288af2b16f46caca0eeda`;
the raw binary digest is not treated as cross-platform canonical.
The compiler-side proof boots it in two stores, reaches `42`/`43`/`44` twice,
records two sums and six prints per store, and executes none of the seven
deferred imports. Wasmtime precompilation passes 1/1 in 500.49 seconds and
produces a separate 62,035,464-byte `.cwasm` with SHA-256
`05b75d7f1e46f92565c42e5a8a3e336983e7e2b0eecfe4889dadab9075988a5a`.
The pinned unchanged Deno commit `1d4e6c1` then exits 0 with the exact six lines
above through real Rust ops. Prior controls remain: the broader focused audit
passed 109/109 relevant tests; five `issue-1472.test.ts` failures reproduced on
pristine `origin/main`; simdutf passed 14/14; and the first `Deno.cwd()`
source-compile and compiler-free AOT integrations passed 1/1 each. The smaller
1,434,192-byte precompiled fixture belongs to that earlier `cwd` proof, not the
current Deno-core artifact.

## PR #5148 checkpoint continuation (2026-08-29, branch claude/deno-integration-map52s)

The draft checkpoint PR #5148 (codex/deno-runtime-integration-checkpoint) was
merged onto `claude/deno-integration-map52s`, reconciled with current main,
and its declared test gaps driven down. Fixed on that branch:

- Promise expandos on the native `$Promise` (`$bag` slot was added but
  `$Promise` never joined `BUILTIN_INSTANCE_CARRIER_STRUCT_NAMES`) — 3 tests.
- Reflected Symbol/Promise constructor statics + runtime-eval slot peel: the
  nullish-callee arm's non-nullish half now dispatches through
  `__apply_closure` instead of answering `undefined` — 3 tests.
- Linked-realm bare identifier reads (symbol-less names no longer classified
  as #3505 cross-module leaks) — fixed shared-globalThis bareRead/bareCall
  and both v8x graph-compiler failures — 3 tests.
- Detached-buffer `.byteLength` (dyn-view arm gated to dynamic receivers;
  bare-vec fallback clamps the -1 marker) — 1 test.
- Realm `Int8Array` identity (seed the #4490 identity carrier, not
  `$__ta_ctor`) and hoisted-capture types for literals the declaration
  promotes to the open `$Object` representation (`{ __proto__: null }`) —
  2 tests.

Remaining known gaps (all reproduce at the checkpoint merge point or on
origin/main — none introduced by the continuation):

- `uncurryThis`: a bare `Function.prototype` VALUE read
  (`const fp = Function.prototype`) throws a raw wasm exception during
  module init (pre-existing; direct `Function.prototype.bind` reads work).
- deno-core bootstrap `createTimer`: lifted-body local-index remapping
  (`references local 2413, but only 35 params + 350 locals`) — the
  PR-documented remapping gap.
- compile-multi finalizer parity's Array-proto-iterator case: sits on the
  host-lane CPR override machinery, which fails 6/7 of
  `tests/issue-1719-cpr.test.ts` on origin/main in this container.
- `#2623` box-depth (3) and `#1312` async recursion (1): pre-existing at the
  merge point.
- `tests/issue-2928-runtime-link.test.ts` "returns and invokes an interpreted
  closure across the Wasm module boundary": hangs in an uninterruptible wasm
  loop until the 20-minute vitest timeout — present since the checkpoint
  merge (reproduced at the merge point with none of the continuation fixes
  applied).

## Current artifact refresh (2026-08-31)

The current exact artifact measures 10,004,942 bytes with SHA-256
`88e2d7dfef7e5fba490bdf79802b7242a11d0cb1eedc2d0ca393ed24416af024`.
It imports exactly nine `v8x:deno` bridges and two deferred `runtime-eval`
imports, with no `env::Promise_new` import. Two isolated stores still complete
the `42`/`43`/`44` stages and all bridge checks. Against the clean checkpoint
without the composed patch (10,007,948 bytes), the patch reduces the artifact
by 3,006 bytes; the larger artifact size predates it.

## Implementation notes (2026-08-31): unoptimized runtime-eval provider

The failed full provider was not a module-init chunking miscompile. Its
unoptimized chunks initialize the interpreter correctly: direct construction,
non-script `FunctionEmitter` emission, and manually constructed interpreted
closures all work. The distinguishing path is real Acorn parsing of a dynamic
Function/direct-eval body. Acorn emits reflective `fn.call(...)` sites; the
interpreter represents those as `GetProp("call")` followed by generic `Call`,
which materializes `%Function.prototype.call%` instead of taking the AOT
static-call rewrite.

That reflected native-prototype member had no standalone body and fell through
to the generic refusal closure. The exception left `createDynamicFunction`/
direct eval unable to return a callable, so only the simple `"1 + 2"` eval
canary passed. The fix gives the standalone `%Function.prototype.call%` value a
receiver-aware variadic body: it separates `[thisArg, ...args]` and invokes the
target through `__apply_closure`, preserving AOT and interpreted callable
carriers. The pre-existing full-provider `__runtime_function_canary` is the
causal regression: Acorn's real dynamic-function parse uses this reflective
route and now returns `3` in a fresh zero-import baseline-only Node build.

An independently compiled user module that performs an indirect eval of a
function declaration still reaches a separate cross-module exception before
the reflective call result can surface. That pre-existing declaration/link
path is not claimed fixed here and must not be used as this change's regression
assertion; a provider-internal function-expression `GetProp("call") + Call`
control returns `42` with this fix.

The initial spike merged in
[#4396](https://github.com/loopdive/js2wasm/pull/4396). The compiler/runtime
follow-ups and primordials bootstrap merged in
[#4404](https://github.com/loopdive/js2wasm/pull/4404). The v8x-side changes are
tracked in
[`loopdive/v8x#1`](https://github.com/loopdive/v8x/pull/1) from
[`codex/js2wasm-module-backend`](https://github.com/loopdive/v8x/tree/codex/js2wasm-module-backend)
through commit `3095ded9b69055ecc936109cf71d270d4acf6c79`, which adds the strict
unchanged-`deno_core` proof on top of the earlier public `Script::Run` bridge.
