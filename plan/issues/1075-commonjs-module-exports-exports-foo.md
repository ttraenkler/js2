# #1075 — CommonJS `module.exports` / `exports.foo` support

## Problem

The vast majority of existing npm packages still ship as CommonJS:
`module.exports = <fn>`, `module.exports.foo = ...`, `exports.foo = ...`,
and `const x = require("y")`. js2wasm currently handles neither the CJS
export forms nor the `require(...)` import form, which means any npm package
that hasn't been converted to ESM is uncompilable through `compileProject`
regardless of the other module-graph fixes in #1060/#1061/#1074.

## Evidence

From `tests/stress/lodash-tier1.test.ts` (the #1031 stress harness):

```ts
runIfInstalled(
  "compileProject on CommonJS lodash/identity.js: no ESM exports emitted",
  () => {
    const result = compileProject("node_modules/lodash/identity.js", { allowJs: true });
    const mod = new WebAssembly.Module(result.binary);
    const funcExports = WebAssembly.Module.exports(mod).filter((e) => e.kind === "function");
    expect(funcExports).toEqual([]);  // CJS path emits nothing
  },
);
```

Real-world impact: `lodash` (main CJS build), `react` (CJS build path), the
majority of older packages on npm, and every package whose main field points
at a CJS file.

## Scope

### Phase 1 — Recognize CJS forms in the TS AST

TypeScript parses CJS files when `allowJs: true` + `checkJs: true` (which
#1061 enabled). The resulting AST expresses `module.exports = x` as a
`BinaryExpression` assignment to a `PropertyAccessExpression`. Scope:

1. Detect `module.exports = <expr>` at top level — treat `<expr>` as the
   module's default export (mirroring #1074 semantics).
2. Detect `module.exports.foo = <expr>` and `exports.foo = <expr>` — treat
   as named exports.
3. Detect `const { a, b } = require("x")` — treat as ESM named imports.
4. Detect `const x = require("x")` — treat as ESM default import.
5. Detect `const x = require("x").foo` — treat as named import of `foo`.

Use the same function-export collection path added in #1074 so ESM and CJS
produce the same Wasm export shape.

### Phase 2 — `require(...)` in the module graph

`ModuleResolver` currently handles ESM import specifiers. Extend it to treat
`require("x")` call expressions as module references equivalent to
`import x from "x"`. `resolveAllImports` walks the TS AST for imports; add
a parallel walk for top-level `require` calls.

Edge case: `require` inside a conditional or inside a function body. For now,
only recognize top-level `require` calls; nested `require` is dynamic and
belongs in a future phase.

### Phase 3 — The `exports` object aliasing

CJS allows `module.exports = exports = { foo }` and similar patterns. In
practice:

- `module.exports = x` replaces the exports binding entirely.
- `exports.foo = x` adds a property to the existing exports object.
- `module.exports.foo = x` is equivalent to `exports.foo = x`.
- `module.exports = require("./other")` re-exports another module — handled
  by resolving the require and forwarding all its exports.

The simplest correct model: build an internal "CJS exports table" during the
AST walk, collapse assignments in source order, and emit the final table as
Wasm exports at the end.

### Phase 4 — Interop with ESM consumers

An ESM file `import lodash from 'lodash/identity'` should resolve to the CJS
`module.exports = identity` and expose `identity` as the default. Mirror the
Node resolver's behavior: the default import of a CJS module is
`module.exports` itself.

## Non-goals

- **`require.resolve`, `require.cache`, `require.main`, `__dirname`, `__filename`**
  — these are Node runtime concerns, not module format concerns. Handle under
  #1044 (Node builtin host imports).
- **Dynamic `require()`** (runtime-computed path) — belongs to #1066 (eval
  standalone) / #1006 (eval JS-host) territory, not static compilation.
- **Circular CJS requires** — CJS has its own cycle semantics that differ
  from ESM; document the limitation and match ESM's cycle handling initially.
- **`__esModule` interop flags** — emit them in the host wrapper where
  needed, but don't introduce them into the compiled guest.
- **Live bindings** — CJS exports are snapshots; ESM exports are live. Do
  not attempt to preserve ESM live-binding semantics through a CJS re-export
  in phase 1.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `compileProject("node_modules/lodash/identity.js")` emits at least one
      Wasm function export that returns its argument unchanged.
- [ ] The #1031 stress test assertion for CJS `lodash/identity.js` flips from
      "no exports" to a working round-trip test.
- [ ] `compileProject("node_modules/lodash/clamp.js")` resolves its internal
      `require("./lodash.baseClamp")` chain and produces a working export
      (depends on #1062 clamp codegen landing).
- [ ] A synthetic fixture at `tests/fixtures/cjs-mixed/index.js` that uses
      `module.exports = {...}` with both a default-like aggregate and named
      properties compiles and exposes all the expected names.
- [ ] A synthetic fixture that uses `const { readFileSync } = require("node:fs")`
      resolves (assuming #1044 Node host imports; may be skip-gated).
- [ ] CJS compilation does not regress ESM tests.

## Risks

- **Subtle semantic gaps between CJS and ESM**: live bindings, `this` in CJS
  module body, top-level `arguments`, top-level `return`. Document each
  deviation; don't try to be perfect in phase 1.
- **`require` is a global in CJS**; it's not declared. The compiler must
  recognize unresolved `require` identifiers at top level as a CJS
  directive, not a missing binding.
- **Mixed ESM+CJS**: a file that uses both `import` and `require` is
  formally invalid ESM but works in TypeScript's `allowJs + checkJs`. Pick
  ESM form when both are present.

## Relationship to #1031

- **#1075 is the fourth prerequisite** for the #1031 Tier 1 lodash demo via
  the CJS `lodash` entry (not `lodash-es`). With #1074 handling ESM defaults
  and #1075 handling CJS, both the main and ESM variants of lodash become
  compilable once #1060/#1061/#1062/#1063 are in place.
- Many real-world npm packages will only be reachable via #1075 — lodash-es
  is the exception, not the rule, in the wider ecosystem.

## Notes

- CJS support is a feature-flag candidate: `--target standalone` with CJS
  disabled is simpler; `--target js-host` with CJS enabled matches real-world
  needs. Start with CJS always-on since the AST detection is cheap and
  identifying CJS files statically is reliable.
- Follow-up candidates once #1075 lands: `.cjs` extension handling,
  `package.json` `"type"` field respecting, `exports` field map resolution.

## Carry-over from the closed PR #3687 (2026-07-31)

PR #3687 (branch `codex/1400-eslint-e2e` @
`561c933af16651e49f50556b8128967892ce529e`, closed unmerged) grew
`src/cjs-rewrite.ts` from 157 to ~500 lines. Part of that is a **source-level**
CommonJS export surface, which is this issue's territory and a different
mechanism from `main`'s codegen-level pattern matching in
`src/codegen/declarations.ts`:

- `module.exports = …` anywhere in the file is rewritten to a mutable
  `__cjs_default_export` binding, prefixed with
  `let __cjs_default_export = Object.create(Object.prototype); const exports = __cjs_default_export;`
  and suffixed with `export default __cjs_default_export;`
- a file that mutates a **free `exports`** object without `module` (the
  esrecurse UMD shape) gets `const exports = {};` plus a synthesized export
  footer
- the cheap pre-check widens from `source.includes("require(")` to also match
  `/\bexports\b/`, so export-only CJS files are no longer skipped unparsed

`main` already handles `module.exports = <fn>` / `module.exports = { … }` /
`exports.foo = <fn>` through `declarations.ts` (proved by
`tests/issue-3654.test.ts`'s `lib/helper.js` compiling and running through
`compileProject`). So the value here is the shapes that pattern matching does
**not** reach — free `exports` mutated inside an IIFE, and `module.exports =
factory()` — not a wholesale replacement. **Measure which shapes actually fail
on `main` before adopting the rewrite**; swapping mechanisms is a much larger
change than closing the residual shapes.

The *graph-linking* half of that same file (nested/residual `require()`
selection) is tracked separately as **#3930** — coordinate, since both edit
`cjs-rewrite.ts`.
