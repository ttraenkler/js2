# #575 — Class statement tests all return 0 (651 FAIL)

## Status: open

ALL 651 "returned 0" failures are in `language/statements/class`. No other category has this problem. This means there's a single bug in how class declarations (not expressions) compile their test wrapper.

Likely cause: the test262 wrapper generates a `test()` function that contains the class declaration + assertions. The function returns 0 (default) instead of the assertion result, because:
1. The class body compiles but the assertion call at the end doesn't contribute to the return value
2. Or: the `test` function's return type is wrong (i32 instead of the assertion's externref)
3. Or: the assertion runs but its result gets dropped before the return

Note: `language/expressions/class` tests PASS — only `statements/class` fails. The difference is declaration vs expression position.

## Complexity: M
