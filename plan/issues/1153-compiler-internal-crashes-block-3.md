## Implementation Summary

Rewrote `restoreBuiltins()` in `scripts/test262-worker.mjs` to snapshot all own property descriptors of compiler-critical prototypes at startup (Array, String, Number, Boolean, RegExp, Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet, Error, Function, Object, Promise, Date) and restore any drift/deletions after every test. Uses value-assignment restore. Follow-up fix (#1157) additionally restored RegExp.prototype accessor descriptors.

**Result**: +2,351 net test improvements, 2,363 improvements / 12 regressions. Merged as PR #246 (2026-04-21).

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED (2026-04-21)

**The three crashes are NOT compiler bugs.**  They are **test262 prototype
poisoning** leaking into subsequent compilations in the shared unified worker
(`scripts/test262-worker.mjs`).  Each of the three crash signatures reproduces
reliably with a one-line poison:

| Crash | Poison that triggers it |
|-------|-------------------------|
| `constructSigs.reduce is not a function`     | `delete Array.prototype.reduce` |
| `cache.set is not a function`                | `delete WeakMap.prototype.set`  |
| `commentDirectiveRegEx.exec is not a function` (and sibling `shebangTriviaRegex.exec`) | `delete RegExp.prototype.exec` |

Reproduction (`.tmp/probe-1153-poison.mjs` / `probe-1153-weakmap.mjs` in the
issue-1153 worktree) loads `scripts/compiler-bundle.mjs`, compiles a trivial
TypeScript source, deletes one prototype method, then recompiles — producing
the exact crash message observed in test262 CI output.

The existing sandbox in `test262-worker.mjs` (`restoreBuiltins()`) only covers
`Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]`, numeric-index accessors on
`Array.prototype`, `Object.prototype` additions, and
`Map.prototype.{get,set,has}`.  It does not restore `Array.prototype.reduce`,
`WeakMap.prototype.set`, `RegExp.prototype.exec`, or any of the other methods
the TypeScript compiler + our codegen rely on internally.  That's why 3,585
tests surface compile_error:wasm_compile crashes with these three signatures
— once a test deletes one of those methods, every subsequent test in the same
worker fork inherits the poison until the fork is recreated
(RECREATE_INTERVAL=100).

### Why the April 19 cascade made it visible

Before PR #195/PR #177, a large fraction of the 3,585 affected tests were
skipped earlier in the pipeline (compile-time type errors etc.), so they
never reached the point where they could poison the shared process.  The
April 19 PRs made more tests progress past the skip filter, exposing the
latent poison-leak defect.

## Fix

Rewrite `restoreBuiltins()` in `scripts/test262-worker.mjs` to snapshot **all
own property descriptors** of the compiler-critical prototypes at startup,
and restore any drift / delete any added keys after every test.  Covers:
Array, Object, Function, String, Number, Boolean, RegExp, Map, Set, WeakMap,
WeakSet, Error, Promise, Symbol, Date.  Non-configurable poison that can't
be reversed exits the worker for pool restart (existing behavior, now with
clearer logging).

Validated: `.tmp/probe-1153-worker-restore.mjs` poisons
`Array.prototype.reduce`, `WeakMap.prototype.set`, `RegExp.prototype.exec` in
a loop; every poison reproduces the original crash, and every call to the
updated `restoreBuiltins()` returns the compiler to a clean state.

# #1153 — Compiler-internal crashes block ~3,585 tests

## Problem

Three distinct TypeError crashes in our compiler prevent ~3,585 test262 tests from even reaching code generation. These are compile-time failures *inside the compiler itself* (not in generated Wasm), surfacing as `compile_error:wasm_compile` buckets.

| Crash signature | Tests affected | Biggest bucket |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| `commentDirectiveRegEx.exec is not a function` | 2,096 | TypedArray/prototype (515), String/prototype (402), Set/prototype (133) |
| `constructSigs.reduce is not a function` | 1,306 | Array/prototype (138), statements/class (72), Object/defineProperty (69) |
| `cache.set is not a function` | 183 | annexB/eval-code (40), WeakMap/prototype (12) |

## Context

After the April 19 cascade (PR #195 + PR #177), the baseline dropped from **22,450 → 21,324** (peak April 17-18 → current). The well-understood clusters (#1147 _start, #1149 null_deref, #1150 async-dstr, #1152 Array proto `.call`) account for ~500 of the regressions. The remaining ~600 net drop — plus ~3,000 tests that now compile-error-crash — is almost entirely from these three compiler-internal errors.

These are **not** part of PR #195 or PR #177's direct regression fingerprint (PR #177's CI showed zero `constructSigs.reduce` crashes). They appeared between the PR #177 CI run (April 19 17:04) and current main. Root cause must be identified by bisecting the intervening commits.

## Crash site #1: `constructSigs.reduce is not a function`

**Source**: `src/codegen/index.ts:4985`
```ts
const constructSigs = refType.getConstructSignatures();
const sig =
  constructSigs.length > 0
    ? constructSigs.reduce((a, b) => (b.parameters.length > a.parameters.length ? b : a))
    : undefined;
```

TypeScript's `Type.getConstructSignatures()` is declared to return `readonly Signature[]`. If at runtime it returns something without `.reduce`, we're either:
1. Calling it on a non-`Type` object (wrong `refType`), or
2. Hitting a TS internal bug where the array is wrapped/proxied

**Check**: log `typeof constructSigs`, `Array.isArray(constructSigs)`, and `Object.getPrototypeOf(constructSigs)` at the crash site; report the `refType.flags` and kind.

## Crash site #2: `cache.set is not a function`

**Source**: `src/codegen/helpers/body-uses-arguments.ts:28` and `:40`
```ts
cache.set(node, true);
...
cache.set(node, false);
```

`cache` is presumably a `WeakMap<ts.Node, boolean>` or `Map`. If it's neither, `.set` isn't available. Either:
1. `cache` is getting reassigned to `null`/`undefined` on the module object, or
2. The cache parameter is not the expected type at call sites.

**Check**: `grep -n "bodyUsesArguments\|body-uses-arguments" src/`, trace all call sites, verify `cache` initialization.

## Crash site #3: `commentDirectiveRegEx.exec is not a function`

This is inside **TypeScript's own compiler** (`commentDirectiveRegEx` is a TS-internal identifier, not ours — grep `node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.js`). It fires when TS tries to scan a source file for `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error` directives and the internal regex has been overwritten or the scanner state is corrupt.

Likely cause: **we're instantiating the TS scanner/parser in a way that corrupts shared global state**. Candidates:
- Re-parsing the same file multiple times with conflicting compiler options.
- Passing a mutable array as `commentDirectives` to a function that overwrites `commentDirectiveRegEx` on the imported TS namespace object.
- Our code monkey-patching a `ts.*` export.

**Check**:
```
grep -rn "commentDirective\|ts\.\(Scanner\|createScanner\)" src/
grep -rn "typescript.*=.*require\|ts =" src/compiler.ts src/codegen/index.ts
```

## Acceptance criteria

1. All three TypeErrors eliminated — no test262 test produces `L1:0 Codegen error: ... is not a function`.
2. Recovery of at least 2,000 tests from compile_error → pass/fail (whichever is correct per-test).
3. `npm test` passes on all suites (including equivalence).
4. Bisect commit identified and noted in this issue for the team retrospective.

## Investigation plan (order matters — each narrows the next)

1. **Bisect `constructSigs.reduce` first** (smallest file, most self-contained). Pick one failing test:
   ```
   test/built-ins/Array/prototype/map/15.4.4.19-3-3.js
   ```
   Run `npx tsx src/cli.ts <test>` with `git bisect start <current-HEAD> ad819fe3` (22450 baseline SHA) and a bisect script that compiles that test and greps for "constructSigs.reduce".
2. **Once the introducing commit is found for crash #2**, inspect what it changed about `getConstructSignatures()` call sites or the `refType` source. Fix in-place or guard (`Array.isArray(constructSigs) ? ... : []`).
3. **Repeat for `cache.set`** — probably the same commit or one nearby, since both are internal invariant violations that likely share a cause (build artifact staleness, dual TS instance, or an ES module interop edge case).
4. **`commentDirectiveRegEx.exec` last**: if crashes #1 and #2 share a root cause (e.g., a dual TypeScript instance where our code and TS's internal code are reading different modules), fixing that root cause will likely fix #3 for free.

## Hypotheses to test first

- **H1: dual TypeScript instances.** `src/compiler.ts` imports `typescript` one way, and a helper imports it another way (e.g., `import * as ts` vs `import ts from`). When both are in play, `instanceof ts.SomeType` fails and `.reduce` (added via prototype extension?) or internal caches diverge. Check `grep -rn "from \"typescript\"\|require(\"typescript\")" src/`.
- **H2: ESM/CJS interop.** A recent bundler/tsconfig change (PR #238, `module: esnext`) might have broken TS's CommonJS assumptions. Check if PR #238 is the bisect target.
- **H3: build artifact staleness.** `dist/` or `.tmp/` has stale compiled output that's loaded at runtime, mismatched with source. Check `find dist .tmp -name "*.js" -newer src/compiler.ts`.

## Don't

- **Don't wrap each call site in try/catch.** That would silence the 3,585 errors but leave the bug live. Fix the root cause.
- **Don't downgrade TS.** We need whatever current TS behavior we built on; the issue is almost certainly in our import/interop surface, not TS.
