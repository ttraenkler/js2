# Issue #549: Security — playground path traversal via symlinks

## Problem

The test262 file API endpoint in `playground/vite-plugin-test262.ts` checks
`resolved.startsWith(testBase)` after `normalize()`, but does not resolve
symlinks. An attacker could place a symlink inside `test262/test/` pointing
to an arbitrary location on the filesystem, and the `startsWith` check would
pass since the normalized path still begins with `testBase`.

## Fix

Use `realpathSync` to resolve symlinks on both the resolved path and the
base directory, then re-check `startsWith` against the real paths.

## Files

- `playground/vite-plugin-test262.ts`
