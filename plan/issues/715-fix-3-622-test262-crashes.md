# #715 -- Fix 3,622 test262 crashes: emitNullGuardedStructGet missing ctx parameter

## Status: done

## Problem

After cherry-picking 13 fixes to main, 3,622 test262 tests started crashing with:
"Internal error compiling expression: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"

The error occurred whenever a mutable closure capture (boxed ref cell) was read or
compound-assigned. The root cause: issue #695 changed `emitNullGuardedStructGet` to accept
`ctx: CodegenContext` as its first parameter (needed for `typeErrorThrowInstrs`), but issue
#702 added two new call sites that used the OLD signature without `ctx`.

When called as `emitNullGuardedStructGet(fctx, objType, ...)`:
- `fctx` (FunctionContext) was bound to the `ctx` parameter
- The ValType `objType` was bound to the `fctx` parameter
- Inside the function, `fctx.locals.length` tried to access `.locals` on a ValType object,
  which is undefined, causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"

## Fix

Added the missing `ctx` argument to both call sites:

1. Line ~2645: `compileIdentifier` -- reading a boxed closure capture
2. Line ~7786: `compileCompoundAssignment` -- compound assignment on a boxed closure capture

## Implementation Summary

- **What was done**: Added missing `ctx` first argument to 2 call sites of `emitNullGuardedStructGet`
- **Files changed**: `src/codegen/expressions.ts`
- **Root cause**: Merge conflict between #695 (changed function signature) and #702 (added new call sites with old signature)
- **Tests**: All closure capture patterns now compile without internal errors
