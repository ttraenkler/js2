# #644 — Integrate conformance report as playground panel

## Status: open

The test262 conformance report (benchmarks/report.html) should be a panel inside the playground IDE, not a standalone page. Clicking a test file path should open it in the playground's file browser/editor.

### Requirements
1. Report renders as a collapsible panel in the playground layout
2. Clicking a file path opens the test262 source in the editor panel
3. Error line is highlighted in the editor
4. Error patterns section shows grouped errors with expandable file lists
5. Live filtering by status (pass/fail/CE/skip) and search

### Approach
- Extract report rendering logic into a reusable module
- Add a "Conformance" tab to the playground's panel system
- Wire file clicks to the editor's `openFile(path, line)` API
- **Shared HTTP server with #725**: the local dev server that serves wasm/source maps
  for V8 stack trace resolution also serves the report UI, test262 sources, and
  playground. One server, multiple uses:
  - `/report.html` — conformance dashboard with trend chart (#714)
  - `/test262/{path}` — test source files (clickable from report)
  - `/wasm/{hash}.wasm` + `.map` — compiled binaries with source maps (#725)
  - `/playground/` — the IDE with conformance panel
- Browser can open wasm source maps in DevTools for interactive debugging

## Complexity: M
