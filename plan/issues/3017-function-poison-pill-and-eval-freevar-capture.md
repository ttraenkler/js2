## Problem

The diagnostic work on #2960 / PR #2548 (dynamic `eval` / `new Function`
diagnostics) established that 3 apparent test262 regressions were coincidental
"pass" losses — those tests were only passing because they leaned on OTHER
pre-existing bugs, not because the compiler implemented the feature under test.
Removing the coincidental support surfaced TWO real, distinct, currently
unimplemented spec-semantics gaps. This issue documents both so they can be
scheduled deliberately.

Neither gap was introduced by #2548; both are pre-existing feature holes that
the sharper diagnostics simply made visible.

---

### Gap 1 — Function `.caller` / `.arguments` poison-pill accessors do not throw

Per ES spec, reading (or writing) the `caller` or `arguments` own property of a
strict-mode function must throw a `TypeError` — the so-called "poison pill"
accessor pair (`%ThrowTypeError%`). This applies to any function that is strict,
including every function created via the `Function` constructor and any function
with an explicit `"use strict"` directive.

Currently the compiler returns `undefined` for `.caller` / `.arguments` on a
real callable instead of throwing.

**Repro:**

```js
var foo = new Function("'use strict';");
foo.caller;      // spec: throws TypeError; actual: returns undefined
foo.arguments;   // spec: throws TypeError; actual: returns undefined
```

**test262 files:**
- `test/language/statements/function/13.2-5-s.js`
- `test/language/statements/function/13.2-13-s.js`

**Direction (not a spec):** the function object's property lookup path needs a
poison-pill accessor for `caller`/`arguments` on strict functions that throws
`TypeError` on get/set rather than resolving to `undefined`. Scope: which
functions count as "strict" (Function-constructor-created, `"use strict"`
bodies, modules) and whether the throw is on the own-property or via the
prototype accessor pair.

---

### Gap 2 — Free-variable capture in the meta-circular `eval` / `Function` shim child module

When `Function("return f();")()` is invoked and `f` is a free variable resolved
from the enclosing lexical scope, the current meta-circular shim compiles the
Function body into a child module that does NOT have access to that free
variable. The result is a spurious `"null is not a function"` runtime error
instead of either correctly resolving `f` or throwing the spec-correct
`ReferenceError` when `f` is genuinely unbound.

**Repro:**

```js
(function () {
  "use strict";
  Function("return f();")();   // actual: "null is not a function" runtime error
})();
```

Note that per spec, functions created by the `Function` constructor are created
in the **global** scope, NOT the caller's scope — so `f` here (a local of the
IIFE) is genuinely NOT visible to the Function body, and the spec-correct
outcome is a `ReferenceError` for an unresolved `f` at call time. The bug is
that the shim produces a different, misleading error (`"null is not a
function"`) rather than the correct `ReferenceError` (or correct resolution when
`f` IS a global). Getting the scoping and the error shape right is the work.

**test262 file:**
- `test/built-ins/Function/15.3.5.4_2-77gs.js`

**Direction (not a spec):** the child-module code path for the eval/Function
shim needs a defined story for free-variable resolution — resolve against the
global environment (spec-correct for the `Function` constructor), and surface a
proper `ReferenceError` for a truly unbound identifier rather than a
downstream null-call error.

---

## Acceptance criteria

1. `new Function("'use strict';").caller` and `.arguments` throw `TypeError`
   (and the two `13.2-*-s.js` test262 files pass).
2. `(function(){"use strict"; Function("return f();")();})()` produces the
   spec-correct `ReferenceError` (unbound global `f`), not a
   `"null is not a function"` error (and `15.3.5.4_2-77gs.js` passes).
3. No net test262 regression relative to the post-#2548 baseline.

## Notes

- Origin: diagnostic follow-up from #2960 / PR #2548.
- The two gaps are independent in mechanism (function-object property semantics
  vs. eval/Function shim scoping) but share an origin and both touch the
  dynamic-`Function` story, so they are filed together. A dev may split them
  into two PRs if that keeps each change small; treat the acceptance criteria as
  independently landable.
- **Gap 2's normative design is now specified** (architect, 2026-07-04) in
  `docs/architecture/runtime-eval-interpreter.md` **§14** (unified name
  resolution, consumer 2): the shim child module compiles free identifiers
  with *eval-code linkage* against a global-environment handle passed from the
  parent module (its globalThis `$Object`), with a root-miss →
  `ReferenceError`. Implementing that section satisfies acceptance criterion 2
  AND fixes the deeper sharing bug (eval'd `var x` landing in the child's
  globals, invisible to the parent). Gap 2 is independent of the #2928
  interpreter and schedulable anytime.
