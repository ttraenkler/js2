# #1043 — `process.env.NODE_ENV` compile-time constant + DCE

## Problem

React, prettier, and many other real-world libraries guard dev-only code paths with `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production')` (or `!== 'production'`). When the compiler ignores this idiom, the dev-mode branches compile too — roughly doubling the surface area and exposing many more bugs than a production build would. This is a significant surface-area amplifier for #1033 (react) Tier 1-2 especially.

## Approach

1. Add a compile-time flag `--define process.env.NODE_ENV=production` (or similar) that substitutes `process.env.NODE_ENV` references with a string literal during the TypeScript pass, before codegen sees them.
2. Rely on existing dead-branch elimination (`src/codegen/dead-elimination.ts`) to prune the now-constant branches. If DCE doesn't catch `if ('production' === 'production')`, extend it.
3. Also handle `typeof process === 'undefined'` and `typeof window === 'undefined'` forms — React uses these for environment detection.

Alternatively, pre-run the source through esbuild's `--define` if the bundled-input workaround from #1041 is already in place. That is probably the cleanest path and zero compiler work.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') { A } else { B }` emits only `A`'s code in production mode and only `B`'s code in dev mode (verified by inspecting the compiled Wasm)
- [ ] React `react.production.min.js` compiles with less surface area than `react.development.js` in the #1033 harness
- [ ] No runtime cost for the substituted expression (not even a string load)

## Non-goals

- Full-fledged environment-based build variants
- A plugin system for arbitrary compile-time constants (keep scope to `process.env.NODE_ENV` and obvious `typeof` checks)

## Related

- Parent: **#1033** (react — biggest beneficiary)
- Architecture: `plan/design/architecture/npm-stress-compiler-gaps.md` cross-cutting gap #8
- Coordinate with: **#1041** (pre-bundled stress tests — esbuild `--define` is the easy alternative path)

## Implementation Summary

**Status**: code complete, tests pass, ready for PR.

The core machinery (text-level substitution in `src/compiler/define-substitution.ts` and constant-folding of literal-vs-literal `if` conditions in `src/codegen/statements/control-flow.ts::evaluateConstantCondition`) already existed in main. This issue completes the feature by:

1. **CLI surface**: added `--define KEY=VALUE` (repeatable) and `--mode production|development` shorthand to `src/cli.ts`. The shorthand auto-installs `process.env.NODE_ENV`, `typeof process`, `typeof window` defines via the existing `buildDefaultDefines` helper.
2. **Experimental-IR fold gap**: the legacy codegen path already constant-folded `if ("production" === "production")`, but the experimental-IR path (default-on for numeric kernels) lowered to `br_if` regardless. Added `evaluateConstantCondition`-based folding to `src/ir/from-ast.ts::lowerStatementList` and `lowerTail`. With the fold, the IR path emits **only** the live arm's instructions — no condition compute, no `if` block, no dead-arm code.
3. **Tests**: `tests/issue-1043.test.ts` (18 tests) — text-level substitution, end-to-end `===` / `!==` folding for `process.env.NODE_ENV` and `typeof process` / `typeof window`, WAT-level absence assertions for the dead arm, dead-branch tolerance for unsupported syntax, CLI integration for both `--define` and `--mode`.

## Test Results

- Issue suite: **18/18 pass** locally (`tests/issue-1043.test.ts`).
- Equivalence regression check: **identical to baseline** (32 files / 105 tests fail on both clean main and this branch — pre-existing, unrelated).

## Acceptance criteria status

- [x] `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') { A } else { B }` emits only `A`'s code in production mode and only `B`'s code in dev mode — verified by WAT-level assertions in `tests/issue-1043.test.ts` (`f64.const 999` / `f64.const 777` absent from `$test`).
- [ ] React harness comparison — deferred; depends on #1033 harness landing.
- [x] No runtime cost — verified: WAT for the if statement collapses to a single literal in both legacy and IR paths.
