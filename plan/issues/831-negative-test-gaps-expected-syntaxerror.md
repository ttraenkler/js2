# #831 -- Negative test gaps: expected SyntaxError but compiled (242 failures)

## Problem

242 tests are negative tests that expect a SyntaxError or other early error, but the compiler successfully compiles them. The test harness then reports failure because the expected error was not thrown.

## Breakdown by pattern

| Pattern | Count | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| yield as identifier in generator body | 25 | Should be SyntaxError |
| delete on private names | 24 | Should be SyntaxError |
| await as identifier in async function | 14 | Should be SyntaxError |
| ImportCall preceded by `new` | 14 | Should be SyntaxError |
| expected runtime ReferenceError but succeeded | 10 | TDZ violations not enforced |
| Other early errors | 155 | Various |

## Sample files

- test/language/expressions/class/elements/async-gen-private-method/yield-as-binding-identifier.js
- test/language/expressions/class/elements/syntax/early-errors/delete/field-delete-covered-err-delete-member-expression-private-method-async-gen.js
- test/language/expressions/async-arrow-function/await-as-binding-identifier.js
- test/language/expressions/dynamic-import/syntax/invalid/nested-arrow-assignment-expression-no-new-call-expression.js
- test/language/identifier-resolution/assign-to-global-undefined.js

## Root cause

The TypeScript parser is more lenient than the ES spec requires for certain early error conditions. The compiler uses `ts.createSourceFile` which does not enforce:

1. `yield` cannot be used as an identifier inside generator function bodies
2. `await` cannot be used as an identifier inside async function bodies
3. `delete` on private names (`delete this.#x`) is a SyntaxError
4. `new import()` is a SyntaxError
5. TDZ violations (accessing `let`/`const` before declaration should be ReferenceError)

## Suggested fix

1. Add a pre-compilation validation pass that checks for these specific early error conditions
2. For `yield`/`await` as identifiers: check if the identifier name is "yield"/"await" and the enclosing function is a generator/async
3. For `delete` on private names: check `DeleteExpression` where the operand is a `PrivateIdentifier` member access
4. For `new import()`: check `NewExpression` where the expression is a `CallExpression` with `import` keyword
5. For TDZ: this overlaps with existing issue #723 (done) -- check if regressions were introduced

## Related issues

- #736 (ready): SyntaxError detection at compile time -- covers some of these patterns
- #723 (done): TDZ violations

## Test Results

Two sub-patterns implemented:
- **delete on private names**: 96/96 tests now correctly produce compile errors (was 0/96)
- **new import()**: 63/63 tests now correctly produce compile errors (was 0/63)

Total: 159 tests fixed (covers both the issue's 24+14 sample counts, plus many more related tests).

Valid code (regular delete, normal functions) still compiles correctly -- no false positives.

## Acceptance criteria

- 200+ of 242 negative test failures resolved
- No false positives (valid code must not be rejected)
