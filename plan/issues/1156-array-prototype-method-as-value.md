# #1156 — `Array.prototype.<method>.call(obj, nonFn)` → "number N is not a function"

## Problem

164 test262 regressions report `"error":"number 1 is not a function"` (or `"number 0"`, etc.) with `error_category: wasm_compile`. The V8 error `"number X is not a function"` is produced when the host's `Array.prototype.reduce` / `forEach` / `every` / `map` / … receives a value of type number where it expects a callback.

Sample failing tests (all from `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/reduce/`):

```
test/built-ins/Array/prototype/reduce/15.4.4.21-9-b-10.js
test/built-ins/Array/prototype/reduce/15.4.4.21-9-b-25.js
test/built-ins/Array/prototype/reduce/15.4.4.21-9-c-ii-29.js
```

All tests use `Array.prototype.reduce.call(arrayLike, numericSentinel, ...)` or similar. The number is intended to be passed through as the **initialValue** (2nd arg) — but the compiled wasm is passing it as the **callbackfn** (1st arg), hence V8's "number N is not a function".

This is the same class of regression as **#1152** (Array.prototype higher-order methods via `.call()`) but in a different slot — #1152 covers the callback being an *object* (typically `{}` from a faked prototype), while this one covers the callback being a *number*. The underlying fix for both is likely the same: `Array.prototype.X` must resolve to a true JS function reference, not to whatever externref result the post-#195 `__extern_get` chain is returning.

## Sample failing tests

Beyond `reduce`, expect the same pattern in:
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/every/*`
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/some/*`
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/map/*`
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/forEach/*`
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/filter/*`

## Root cause

Same as #1152: PR #195 (`fix(#1026)`) routes `String.prototype` / `Number.prototype` / `Boolean.prototype` through `__extern_get(__extern_get(globalThis, "<Ctor>"), "prototype")`. The narrowing intentionally excludes `Array.prototype`, but a later property-access path (`Array.prototype.reduce`) still ends up with an externref that, when `.call`-ed, causes argument shuffling to happen one slot off — the receiver (arrayLike) ends up in the function slot, and subsequent args shift down.

This bug was masked before PR #195 by a pre-existing codegen path that handled `Array.prototype.<method>` specially. That specialization apparently does not fire when the method lookup itself goes through the externref path for `.call`.

## Fix approach

1. Resolve #1152 first — the method-as-value path that it establishes for `Array.prototype.<method>.call` must also cover numeric-initial-value cases. The fix should be purely in the codegen for `PropertyAccessExpression` on `Array.prototype` followed by `.call(...)`.
2. Verify that the `.call` wrapper preserves argument ordering: `fn.call(thisArg, ...args)` → the compiler must emit `fn(thisArg, ...args)` with `this` substituted, not shuffle `thisArg` into the callback slot.
3. Add a scoped test `tests/issue-1156-reduce-numeric-init.test.ts` covering:
   - `Array.prototype.reduce.call([1,2,3], (a,b)=>a+b, 0)` — initialValue = 0
   - `Array.prototype.reduce.call({0:1,1:2,length:2}, (a,b)=>a+b, 1)` — arrayLike + initialValue
4. Confirm the 164 tests pass; re-run equivalence tests.

## Acceptance criteria

- All sample failing tests pass.
- The error string `"number N is not a function"` count in the test262 results drops to 0.
- No regressions in `tests/equivalence.test.ts`.
- #1152 resolves simultaneously (same codepath).

## Test Results (2026-04-21)

After #1152 (PR #247) landed, the landscape changed. The 3 sample failing tests
named in the problem section now show a different failure mode: instead of
"number 1 is not a function" at runtime, the compiler emits invalid Wasm —
`local.set` with nothing on the stack — during `WebAssembly.instantiate`.

**Root cause (post-#1152)**: `compileArrayLikePrototypeCall` for `reduce`,
`reduceRight`, and `map` builds a `*ResultToExternref` coercion block with
`closureInfo.returnType?.kind === "f64" | "i32" | "ref" | "ref_null"` branches
and a final fall-through `[]`. That fall-through is correct for
`returnType.kind === "externref"` (call_ref already leaves an externref on the
stack), but WRONG for `returnType === null` (void callback): call_ref leaves
nothing, yet the following `local.set accTmp/mappedTmp` requires one value.

**Fix**: treat the two cases separately — push `ref.null.extern` for void
callbacks, keep the empty fall-through for the `externref` case.

**Validation**:

- 3/3 scoped tests in `tests/issue-1156.test.ts` pass (reduce, reduceRight, map
  with void callbacks on array-likes).
- 3/3 sample reduce tests from the problem section no longer throw validation
  errors: 15.4.4.21-9-b-10.js PASS, 15.4.4.21-9-b-25.js FAIL ret=2 (assertion
  about obj prototype walk — unrelated), 15.4.4.21-9-c-ii-29.js PASS.
- Sampled 40 of the 164 baseline targets: 9 PASS, 5 assertion-FAIL, 0
  validation errors, 26 unrelated runtime throws (ArrayBuffer/BigInt/DataView/
  Function/Iterator paths that were bundled under this error bucket but are
  separate regressions).
- Equivalence suite: 2 failures in `tests/array-methods.test.ts` (pop, shift)
  are pre-existing — identical before and after this fix.

**Expected net test262 delta**: ~9-40 of the 164 recover as PASS (the
reduce/reduceRight/map-via-call cases). The remaining failures belong to
other issues that were misclassified into the same error bucket.
