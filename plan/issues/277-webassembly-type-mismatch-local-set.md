# Issue #277: WebAssembly type mismatch -- local.set externref vs concrete types

## Status: done
completed: 2026-03-12

## Summary
~41 tests fail with "WebAssembly.instantiate(): Compiling function failed: local.set expected type externref, found ..." The codegen assigns concrete-typed values (struct refs, i32, f64) to locals declared as externref, or vice versa. The local type declaration and assignment coercion need to agree.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group A

## Complexity: M

## Scope
- Audit local variable type declarations vs actual assigned value types
- Insert coercion instructions when assigning to externref-typed locals
- Consider widening local types when multiple value types flow into a local
- Update variable assignment in `src/codegen/statements.ts` and `src/codegen/expressions.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Local variable assignments use consistent types with proper coercions
- At least 20 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added coercion instructions when assigning concrete types (f64, i32, struct refs) to externref-typed locals
- Widened local types when multiple value types flow into a local
- Fixed local.set type mismatches across variable assignment paths

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — coercion in assignment paths
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — variable declaration type widening
- `tests/issue-277.test.ts` — tests (all passing)

### Impact
~41 type mismatch errors fixed
