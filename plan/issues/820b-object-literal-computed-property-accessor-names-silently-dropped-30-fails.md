# #820b — Object literal computed-property accessor names silently dropped

## Problem
`{ get [0]() {...}, set [0](v) {...} }` — accessor is silently dropped.
obj['0'] then returns undefined; test262 null-derefs in the assert harness.

## Root cause
src/codegen/literals.ts line 247 rejects ComputedPropertyName outright
("computed: out of scope"). Same restriction at line 360. Patch adds
resolveAccessorPropName() that handles literal-only computed expressions.

## Fix
~16 LOC change; see literals-ts-patch.diff. Test in issue-820b-test.ts.

## Impact: ~30 fails
- language/expressions/object/accessor-name-* (~22)
- language/computed-property-names/object/* (~7)
- language/computed-property-names/class/* (a couple)
