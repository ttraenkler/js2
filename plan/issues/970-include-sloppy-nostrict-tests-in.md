# #970 — Include sloppy tests in runner

## Problem

The test262 runner pre-filters sloppy (noStrict) tests so they never run. The report page's "strict mode" toggle has no effect because strict_pass === pass in all runs.

## Fix

1. Runner: stop skipping noStrict tests, tag results with `sloppy: true`
2. Run index: record separate strict_pass/strict_total excluding sloppy tests
3. Report: toggle already exists, will work once data is available

## Acceptance Criteria

- Sloppy tests run and appear in results JSONL
- strict_pass/strict_total differ from pass/total in run index
- Report toggle filters correctly
