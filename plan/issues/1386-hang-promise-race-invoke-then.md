# #1386 — Promise.race invoke-then hang

## Problem

`test/built-ins/Promise/race/invoke-then.js` is in HANGING_TESTS. The test hangs —
either during compilation or at runtime.

Per the backlog note in #860: the test previously hung at runtime (Promise.race loop),
but may now error instead of hang. Needs fresh investigation to determine current
behavior.

## Investigation steps

```bash
npx tsx -e "
import {compile} from './src/index.ts';
import {readFileSync} from 'fs';
const src = readFileSync(
  'test262/test/built-ins/Promise/race/invoke-then.js', 'utf-8'
);
const t0 = Date.now();
const r = compile(src, {fileName:'test.ts'});
console.log('compile:', Date.now() - t0, 'ms');
if (!r.success) { console.log('CE:', r.errors[0].message); process.exit(0); }
const timeout = setTimeout(() => { console.log('HANG at runtime'); process.exit(1); }, 5000);
const {instance} = await WebAssembly.instantiate(r.binary, {});
clearTimeout(timeout);
instance.exports.test?.();
console.log('PASS/FAIL — no hang');
" 2>&1
```

## Expected outcome

If compile hang: trace the recursive compilation path causing unbounded recursion.
If runtime hang: trace the Promise.race iteration that never terminates.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Test terminates within 5 seconds (pass, fail, or CE — no hang).
2. Remove the HANGING_TESTS entry for `test/built-ins/Promise/race/invoke-then.js`.
3. No regression in Promise.race suite.

## Investigation result (senior-dev, 2026-05-08)

**Compile no longer hangs.** Empirically verified via the suggested probe
(through `wrapTest`):

```
shouldSkip: { skip: false }
compile elapsed: 1563 ms
compile success: false
compile errors count: 6
5s threshold: PASS
```

The 6 compile errors are TypeScript-style type mismatches on
`p1.then = p2.then = p3.then = function(a, b) {…}` — our compiler
infers the lambda returns `void` while `.then` expects
`Promise<TResult1 | PromiseLike<TResult1>>`. These errors are
correct behavior for a TS-strict compiler; the test source is
sloppy-mode JS that monkey-patches `.then` directly.

The historical "hang" referenced by the comment ("#408: Promise.race
compilation hang") no longer reproduces — the compiler completes
quickly and produces deterministic errors. Reclassifying this entry
from `skip` → `compile_error` is a bookkeeping move, not a regression
(the test was never passing).

Fix: remove the HANGING_TESTS entry. Test will report as `compile_error`
in baseline tally. No runtime hang risk because the test never reaches
runtime.
