# #691 — Pipeline architecture: interleave stages and minimize memory pressure

## Status: open

### Current architecture (sequential per batch)
```
Worker: [load 12K files] → [compile all] → [run all] → [return all results]
                    ↑ peak memory: all sources + all binaries + all instances in RAM
```

### Proposed: streaming pipeline
```
Worker:  load(1) → compile(1) → run(1) → emit(1) → load(2) → compile(2) → ...
                              ↑ peak memory: 1 source + 1 binary + 1 instance
```

### Memory pressure reduction

**1. Immediate release after each stage:**
```typescript
for (const test of batch) {
  const source = readFileSync(test.path, "utf-8");  // ~10KB
  const wrapped = wrapTest(source, meta);
  // source can be GC'd now
  
  const result = compile(wrapped.source);
  // wrapped can be GC'd now
  
  if (result.success) {
    const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(result.binary, imports);
    // result.binary (potentially 100KB+) can be GC'd now
    // result.wat (potentially 500KB+) can be GC'd now
    
    const ret = instance.exports.test();
    // instance can be GC'd now
    
    parentPort.postMessage({ file, status, error });
    // Only the 200-byte result message survives
  }
}
```

**2. Don't hold WAT in memory:**
Currently `compile()` returns both `binary` and `wat`. WAT is only for debugging. Skip it during test runs:
```typescript
compile(source, { skipWat: true })  // saves ~500KB per compilation
```

**3. Don't hold source map in memory:**
Source maps are large. Only generate when needed (error enrichment):
```typescript
compile(source, { sourceMap: false })  // save ~200KB per compilation
// Re-compile with sourceMap: true only for failed tests
```

**4. Worker-level GC hints:**
After each test, nudge V8 to collect:
```typescript
if (global.gc) global.gc();  // requires --expose-gc
// Or: allocate a large ArrayBuffer and immediately release it to trigger GC
```

**5. Compile result pooling:**
Reuse the compile result object instead of allocating new ones:
```typescript
const resultPool = { success: false, binary: null, wat: null, errors: [] };
compile(source, { into: resultPool });  // mutate instead of allocate
```

### Interleaving across workers

With #689's work-stealing queue and #690's small batches:
```
Worker 1: load(A) → compile(A) → run(A) → emit(A) → load(E) → ...
Worker 2: load(B) → compile(B) → run(B) → emit(B) → load(F) → ...
Worker 3: load(C) → compile(C) → run(C) → emit(C) → load(G) → ...
Worker 4: load(D) → compile(D) → run(D) → emit(D) → load(H) → ...
                  ↑ peak: 4 × (1 source + 1 binary) ≈ 4 × 600KB = 2.4MB
                    vs current: 4 × (3000 sources + binaries) ≈ 4 × 2GB = 8GB
```

### Expected impact
- Peak worker memory: **2GB → ~300MB** per worker (one test at a time)
- Can run **8+ workers** in 16GB container instead of 4
- Test run time: **~same or faster** (compile/run is CPU-bound, not IO-bound)
- Results stream in real-time instead of batch

### Quick wins (no architecture change)
1. `skipWat: true` during test runs — saves 500KB per compile
2. `sourceMap: false` for passing tests — saves 200KB per compile
3. Set `result.binary = null` after instantiation — immediate GC
4. Set `source = null` after wrapTest — immediate GC

## Complexity: M (quick wins), L (full pipeline)
