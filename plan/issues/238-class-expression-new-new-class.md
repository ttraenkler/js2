# Issue #238: Class expression new -- `new (class { ... })()` pattern

## Status: done

## Summary

158 tests fail with "Unsupported new expression for class: __class". These tests use inline class expressions in `new` expressions, like `new (class { constructor() { ... } })()`. The class compiles but the `new` expression does not recognize the inline class as a valid constructor target.

## Root Cause

The `collectAnonymousClassesInNewExpr` function in `src/codegen/index.ts` had a `!inner.name` guard that prevented named class expressions (e.g., `new (class MyClass { ... })()`) from being pre-registered. Only truly anonymous class expressions were collected. Named class expressions fell through to the type-checker path, which could not find them in `classSet` because they were never registered.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- collection phase for class expressions in new expressions
- Tests affected: ~158 compile errors

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `new (class { ... })()` compiles and instantiates correctly (already worked via #273)
- [x] Named inline class expressions work: `new (class C { ... })()`
- [x] No regression in existing class/new tests

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Removed the `!inner.name` guard from `collectAnonymousClassesInNewExpr` in `src/codegen/index.ts`. This allows both anonymous and named class expressions inside `new` expressions to be pre-registered with synthetic names. For named class expressions, the synthetic name includes the original name (e.g., `__anonClass_MyClass_0`) to aid debugging.

### What worked
- The fix was a one-line change (removing the `!inner.name` condition and adjusting synthetic name generation)
- The body compilation phase (`compileAnonymousClassBodiesInNode`) already lacked the `!inner.name` guard, so no changes were needed there
- The `compileNewExpression` handler already looked up classes via `ctx.anonClassExprNames` which works for both named and anonymous class expressions

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- removed `!inner.name` guard in `collectAnonymousClassesInNewExpr`, added name-based synthetic name for named class expressions

### Tests
- Added `tests/issue-238.test.ts` with 5 test cases covering anonymous, named, with-method, and with-args patterns
- All equivalence tests pass with no regressions
