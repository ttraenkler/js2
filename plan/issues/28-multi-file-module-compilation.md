# Issue 28: Multi-file module compilation

## Status: done

## Summary
Support `import { foo } from "./bar"` where both files are compiled into a single Wasm module, with cross-file function calls resolved at compile time.

## Motivation
Real projects use multiple files. Currently only single-file compilation is supported. External imports are resolved to `declare` stubs, but local file imports should be compiled together.

## Design

### Approach: Merge before codegen
1. Accept multiple source files as input
2. Parse and type-check all files together (tsc's `createProgram` already supports this)
3. Collect all function/type declarations across files into a single IR module
4. Resolve cross-file references during codegen (function calls, type references)
5. Emit a single Wasm module

### API change
```ts
compile(sources: string | Record<string, string>, options?)
```
When `sources` is a `Record<string, string>`, keys are file paths and values are source code.

### CLI change
Accept multiple input files or a directory.

## Scope
- `src/index.ts` — accept multiple sources
- `src/compiler.ts` — multi-file program creation
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — cross-file declaration collection
- `src/cli.ts` — multi-file input
- Tests: new `tests/multi-file.test.ts`

## Complexity: L

## Acceptance criteria
- Two files: `math.ts` exports `add()`, `main.ts` imports and calls `add()`
- Compiled into a single Wasm module with both functions
- Circular imports between two files work
