# #974 — Generate feature table JS/WAT examples from TypeScript

## Problem

The JS and WAT code examples in the landing page feature table are hand-maintained HTML. They get out of sync, have HTML escaping issues, and don't update when the compiler improves.

## What to build

A TypeScript script (`scripts/generate-feature-examples.ts`) that:

1. Defines each feature as a `{ name, js, description }` object
2. Compiles each JS snippet with `compile(src, { emitWat: true })`
3. Extracts the most relevant function from the WAT output (prefer named functions over `__module_init`, truncate at ~15 lines)
4. Cleans up the WAT for readability (add comments, simplify type refs)
5. Outputs a JSON file (`public/feature-examples.json`) with `{ name, js, wat, description }` per feature
6. The landing page reads this JSON at build time and renders the feature table

## Key requirements

- JS examples must be valid TypeScript that compiles successfully
- WAT output must be the ACTUAL compiler output (cleaned up, not hand-written)
- HTML escaping handled automatically (no manual `&lt;` etc.)
- Script runs during `build:pages` to keep examples fresh
- Features that need host imports should be tagged `hostImport: true`

## Current examples location

The 48 features are currently inline in `index.html` lines ~1280-2200. The script replaces all that with data-driven rendering.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `pnpm run generate:feature-examples` produces correct JSON
- Landing page renders from JSON, not inline HTML
- All JS examples compile without errors
- WAT matches actual compiler output
- No manual HTML escaping needed
