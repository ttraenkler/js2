# #376 -- Decorator syntax support

## Status: in-review
10+ tests use class decorators (@decorator), which cause compile errors because TypeScript diagnostic codes related to decorators were not suppressed.

## Pragmatic approach

Rather than implementing full decorator semantics (which would be very complex), we suppress all decorator-related TypeScript diagnostics and compile decorated classes as regular classes, ignoring the decorators. This resolves the compile errors.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added 17 decorator-related TypeScript diagnostic codes to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` in `src/compiler.ts` (codes 1206, 1207, 1236, 1237, 1249, 1270, 1271, 1278, 1279, 1329, 1433, 1436, 1486, 1497, 1498, 8038, 18036)
- Added 7 syntactic decorator diagnostic codes to `TOLERATED_SYNTAX_CODES` (1206, 1207, 1436, 1486, 1497, 1498, 8038) -- these are critical because syntactic errors abort compilation entirely
- Codes 1238-1241 were already present from issue #271
- Added equivalence test `tests/equivalence/decorator-syntax.test.ts` with 3 test cases

### What worked
- The codegen already ignores decorators naturally -- class/method declarations are processed without looking at decorator nodes in the AST
- The only issue was TypeScript diagnostics blocking compilation

### Files changed
- `src/compiler.ts` -- added diagnostic codes to DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES and TOLERATED_SYNTAX_CODES
- `tests/equivalence/decorator-syntax.test.ts` -- new test file (3 tests)

### Tests now passing
- decorator-syntax.test.ts: 3/3 pass (class decorator, method decorator, multiple decorators)

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Decorated classes compile (decorators ignored)
- [x] 10+ compile errors resolved (17 new diagnostic codes suppressed)
