# #1209 — js2wasm hosted lane: ESM resolver error in benchmark harness

## Problem

The `js2wasm -> Node.js (hosted)` lane in `labs/benchmarks/compare-runtimes.ts`
fails with `runtime-error: Error: node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:271` for
all benchmarks except fib-recursive (which shows a different compile-error).

Observed in the 2026-04-29 benchmark run:

```
| js2wasm -> Node.js (hosted) | | | | runtime-error: Error: node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:271 |
```

This means the hosted-mode runner (`labs/benchmarks/competitive/run-node-wasm-program.mjs`)
fails before the Wasm module even executes.

## Likely cause

The hosted Wasm module needs JS host imports (e.g. `__box_number`, `wasm:js-string`
builtins). The Node.js runner either:
1. Does not provide the required imports, or
2. Fails to resolve a module path (e.g., `wasm:js-string` spec module) in this environment

The `node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:271` traceback points to Node's ESM resolver
rejecting a module specifier — likely `wasm:js-string` or a related import specifier
that requires a flag or env setup that the runner doesn't enable.

## Investigation

1. Read `labs/benchmarks/competitive/run-node-wasm-program.mjs` — check what imports it
   attempts to instantiate the Wasm module with
2. Reproduce the error with a minimal example:
   ```bash
   BENCHMARK_FILTER=fib bash labs/benchmarks/run.sh 2>&1
   ```
   and inspect the full stderr from `evaluateJs2WasmNode`
3. Check if Node.js `--experimental-wasm-modules` or `--experimental-vm-modules`
   is required
4. Check if the hosted Wasm module uses `wasm:js-string` imports and whether the
   Node.js version in the lab supports them

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `js2wasm -> Node.js (hosted)` shows timing numbers for at least `fib` and `array-sum`
- [ ] No `runtime-error` or `compile-error` for those benchmarks
- [ ] Or: a clear note in the harness explaining why hosted mode is intentionally skipped
  (e.g., "wasm:js-string not supported in Node.js 22") with status `unavailable`
  instead of `runtime-error`
