# #136 — Loose equality (== / !=)

## Problem
`==` and `!=` with mixed types are skipped. JS loose equality has complex coercion rules (ToNumber, ToPrimitive, etc.).

## Scope
- `null == undefined` → true
- `0 == false` → true
- `"" == 0` → true
- `"42" == 42` → true
- Object-to-primitive via valueOf/toString

## Implementation
- For same-type operands: delegate to `===`
- For number/string: convert string to number, then compare
- For boolean/other: convert boolean to number, then compare
- For null/undefined: equal to each other, not to anything else
- Can implement as a runtime helper function or inline dispatch
