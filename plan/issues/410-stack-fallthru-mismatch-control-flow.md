# #410 -- Stack fallthru mismatch: control flow branches leave wrong stack state

## Status: in-review
590 tests fail with "expected N elements on the stack for fallthru, found M". This is a Wasm validation error where control flow branches (if/else, switch cases, try/catch) leave different numbers of values on the operand stack.

## Root cause (actual)

The root cause was NOT control flow branch imbalance. Instead, it was duplicate/unfilled placeholder functions in the Wasm module:

1. **Duplicate method functions**: `ensureStructForType` in `index.ts` pre-registers placeholder functions (empty body) for object literal methods so call targets can be resolved early. Then `compileObjectLiteralForStruct` in `expressions.ts` creates a *second* function with the actual body and pushes it to `ctx.mod.functions`, leaving the first placeholder with an empty body. Both functions get emitted to Wasm, and the empty-body placeholder fails validation when its return type requires a value.

2. **PropertyAssignment closures mistakenly pre-registered**: For `valueOf: function() { ... }` patterns (PropertyAssignment with function expression initializer), the pre-registration creates a placeholder function. But these are compiled as closures (eqref struct fields), not direct method calls -- so the placeholder function never gets its body filled.

## Fix

Two changes:

1. **`expressions.ts` (compileObjectLiteralForStruct)**: When compiling a MethodDeclaration, check if a placeholder already exists via `ctx.funcMap.get(fullName)`. If so, reuse it instead of creating a duplicate. This prevents empty-body placeholder functions from lingering.

2. **`index.ts` (ensureStructForType)**: Only pre-register `MethodDeclaration` nodes, not `PropertyAssignment` with function initializers. The latter are compiled as closures and the placeholder function would never be filled.

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] All if/else branches produce matching stack depths at merge points
- [x] Reduce stack fallthru CEs by 200+
- [x] Equivalence tests: 5 failures -> 3 failures (remaining are unrelated: string_indexOf import, test mismatch)

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Fixed duplicate placeholder functions for object literal methods by reusing pre-registered placeholders
- Fixed unfilled placeholder functions for PropertyAssignment closures by narrowing pre-registration filter

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- compileObjectLiteralForStruct: check for existing placeholder before creating new function
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- ensureStructForType: only pre-register MethodDeclaration, not PropertyAssignment with function initializers

### Tests
- Equivalence tests: 650 pass, 3 fail (down from 5 fail, all 3 remaining are unrelated)
- "object literal method" test now passes
- "getter returns computed value" test now passes (was timing out)
- "valueOf coercion" tests now pass
