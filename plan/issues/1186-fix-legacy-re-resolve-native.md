# #1186 — Legacy `compileForOfString` produces invalid Wasm in `nativeStrings: true` mode

## Problem

`compile(source, { nativeStrings: true })` produces invalid WebAssembly
when the source contains `for (const c of <string>)`. The Wasm
validator fails with:

```
CompileError: function fn failed: call[0] expected externref, found local.get of type i32
```

Reproducible on `main` (without any IR changes):

```ts
const source = `
  export function fn(s: string): number {
    let n = 0;
    for (const c of s) { n = n + 1; }
    return n;
  }
`;
const r = compile(source, { experimentalIR: false, nativeStrings: true });
// r.success === true, but...
WebAssembly.compile(r.binary);  // throws CompileError
```

## Root cause

`compileForOfString` (`src/codegen/statements/loops.ts:~1487`) reads
`ctx.nativeStrHelpers.get("__str_charAt")` and embeds the resulting
funcIdx as a literal in the emitted `call` op. The funcIdx was
captured at registration time, but `addLateImport` / `addImport` calls
that happen later in the compilation pipeline shift the entire
function index space — and the legacy `shiftLateImportIndices` pass
walks bodies and updates `funcMap`, but does NOT touch
`ctx.nativeStrHelpers`. So `__str_charAt`'s captured funcIdx becomes
stale, and at runtime points at whatever import landed at that
position (in the reproducer above, that's `__is_truthy`).

The IR path (#1183, slice 6 part 4) sidesteps this by re-resolving
funcref names against `ctx.mod.functions[i].name` at lowering time —
post-shift safe. The legacy path needs the same treatment.

## Fix options

**Option A (preferred): re-resolve at the call site in `compileForOfString`**

Replace the funcIdx capture with a name walk:

```ts
let charAtIdx: number | undefined;
for (let i = 0; i < ctx.mod.functions.length; i++) {
  if (ctx.mod.functions[i]!.name === "__str_charAt") {
    charAtIdx = ctx.numImportFuncs + i;
    break;
  }
}
if (charAtIdx === undefined) {
  reportError(ctx, stmt, "for-of on string: __str_charAt helper not available");
  return;
}
```

This keeps the change scoped to one site. Other consumers of
`ctx.nativeStrHelpers` may have similar bugs — audit them but only
touch the ones that fire in real-world code.

**Option B: extend `shiftLateImportIndices` to also rewrite `ctx.nativeStrHelpers`**

More invasive but kills the bug class once. Walk
`ctx.nativeStrHelpers` and shift each entry by the same delta as
`funcMap`. Risk: if any helper was registered AS an import (vs a
defined function), the shift logic differs — need to verify each
entry's source.

I recommend **A** for this issue: smallest blast radius, easy to
land, easy to test. **B** can come as a follow-up if more sites with
the same staleness pattern surface.

## Audit list (other consumers of `ctx.nativeStrHelpers`)

Probably-safe (registered + used in a single phase, no inter-shift
sites):
  - `__str_concat` / `__str_equals` — used inline by string `+` /
    `===` lowering, but that lowering reads from
    `ctx.nativeStrHelpers` at use site each time. Likely safe but
    confirm.
  - `__str_flatten` — similar pattern.

Probably-unsafe (capture + emit pattern):
  - `__str_charAt` (THIS ISSUE)
  - any helper called from a wrapper-emit path that captures the
    funcIdx into a local var before emitting the body

Quick audit: `grep -rn 'nativeStrHelpers.get' src/codegen/` and
inspect each call site for the capture-vs-walk pattern.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `compile(source, { nativeStrings: true })` with the reproducer
   above produces valid Wasm that runs and returns `5` for
   `fn("hello")`. (Note: native-mode JS-string param coercion is a
   separate test-runtime issue tracked in #1187 — for the test here,
   use an inline string literal as in #1183's tests.)
2. New equivalence test in `tests/issue-1186.test.ts` mirroring
   `tests/issue-1183.test.ts`'s native-mode cases but exercising the
   LEGACY path (`experimentalIR: false`).
3. After the fix, the dual-run cases I disabled in
   `tests/issue-1183.test.ts` (the native-mode `dualRun` calls) can
   be re-enabled. Nice to verify but not required for this issue.
4. CI test262 net delta ≥ 0; native-strings test262 sub-suite
   strictly improves.

## Out of scope

- Option B (the `shiftLateImportIndices` extension) — defer to a
  follow-up after this fix lands.
- A full audit of every `ctx.nativeStrHelpers.get(...)` call site for
  similar bugs — spot-fix the known sites, file follow-ups for any
  others surfaced.

## Implementation Notes (senior-developer, 2026-04-27)

### Fix applied

Replaced the funcIdx capture in `compileForOfString`
(`src/codegen/statements/loops.ts:~1487`) with a name walk against
`ctx.mod.functions[i].name`. Mirrors the IR resolver pattern from
#1183 (`src/ir/integration.ts:resolveFunc`'s `ctx.mod.functions`
fallback). The resolved index is `ctx.numImportFuncs + i` — the
absolute funcIdx in the post-shift index space.

The change is local to one site (option A from the spec). Other
`ctx.nativeStrHelpers.get(...)` consumers in the legacy codebase
were left as-is; if they exhibit the same staleness pattern each
should be filed as its own issue with a reproducer.

### Verification

  1. Local probe — both legacy and IR modes produce valid Wasm and
     identical runtime results for 5 representative test cases
     (count chars, empty string, single-char, `c.length` in body,
     BMP unicode). All 10 (5 cases × 2 modes) pass.
  2. New regression test `tests/issue-1186.test.ts` — 11 cases:
     - 5 legacy+nativeStrings cases asserting expected runtime values
     - 5 legacy↔IR equivalence cases (re-enabling the dual-run that
       #1183 had to skip due to this bug)
     - 1 host-strings sanity check
  3. Prior IR tests pass unchanged (128/128 across #1169d / #1169e /
     #1182 / #1183 / `tests/ir/`).
  4. Local equivalence suite — exit 0.

### Files touched

  - `src/codegen/statements/loops.ts` — name-walk lookup for
    `__str_charAt`, ~25-line comment block explaining the rationale.
  - `tests/issue-1186.test.ts` — new regression test (11 cases).
  - `plan/issues/ready/1186.md` — these implementation notes.

### Related work unblocked

  - #1183's `tests/issue-1183.test.ts` native-mode dual-run cases
    (currently asserting against JS-computed expected values
    instead of legacy parity) can be re-enabled in a follow-up
    after this lands.
  - #1187 (test-runtime JS↔native-string coercion) becomes more
    valuable once this lands — broader native-strings test surface
    flows through dual-run with a coercion helper.
