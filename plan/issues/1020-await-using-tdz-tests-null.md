# #1020 — await-using TDZ tests: null_deref crash in assert_throwsAsync

## Problem

4 `await-using` tests crash with `null_deref` inside `assert_throwsAsync()`:

- `test/language/statements/await-using/block-local-use-before-initialization-in-prior-statement.js`
- `test/language/statements/await-using/function-local-use-before-initialization-in-prior-statement.js`
- `test/language/statements/await-using/global-use-before-initialization-in-prior-statement.js`
- `test/language/statements/await-using/syntax/await-using-invalid-assignment-statement-body-for-of.js`

These tests all follow this pattern:

```javascript
asyncTest(async function () {
  await assert.throwsAsync(ReferenceError, async function() {
    x; await using x = null;  // TDZ: x used before await using declaration
  });
});
```

## Root cause

`await using` is not implemented in ts2wasm (tracked in #990). The compiled function body for `async function() { x; await using x = null; }` produces broken Wasm that causes a null dereference trap when called.

These tests were **previously passing as false positives**: when `assert_throwsAsync(fn: () => void)` called `fn()` as a void Wasm call, the broken compilation happened to produce a catchable Wasm exception, which the `catch (e) { return; }` block caught — masking the real crash.

The fix in #1014 changed `fn: () => any` (to capture thenable returns from async generators). With `fn: () => any`, `fn()` uses `call_ref` with an `externref` return type. This different code path causes the broken `await using` compilation to produce an uncatchable null dereference trap instead of a catchable exception.

## Why these are false positives

These tests are checking TDZ behavior of `await using` — a feature from the explicit resource management proposal. Since `await using` is not implemented, the tests should be **skipped**, not accidentally passing.

The tests are currently skipped in `shouldSkip()` via the rule added in #1020 (`await-using` path + `asyncHelpers.js` include) and will be re-enabled when `await using` is properly supported.

## Fix

Implement `await using` statement support in ts2wasm (depends on #990 for early error detection). Once the statement is compiled correctly:
1. The inner function body should throw `ReferenceError` (TDZ violation) when `x` is accessed before `await using x = null`
2. `assert_throwsAsync` will catch the throw and the tests will pass correctly

## Current workaround

Skip these 4 tests (added in #1014 via `AWAIT_USING_ASYNC_NULL_DEREF_TESTS` set in `test262-runner.ts`).
