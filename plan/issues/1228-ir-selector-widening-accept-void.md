# #1228 — IR selector widening: accept `void` return + `any` params

## Problem

The corpus measurement from #1169q showed 0% IR claim rate on test262. Two
selector gaps blocked all functions:

1. **`return-type-not-resolvable` (void): 68.1%** — functions returning `void`
   (assert helpers, side-effect-only setters, etc.) were rejected because the
   selector only accepted `f64`/`bool`/`string`/`object` returns.
2. **`param-type-not-resolvable` (any): 15.9%** — functions with `any`-typed
   parameters were rejected because the selector had no `AnyKeyword` arm.

Together these account for ~84% of selector fallbacks on test262 — and they're
unblocked by extending two functions in `src/ir/select.ts` plus the matching
arms in `src/codegen/index.ts`'s `resolvePositionType`.

## Implementation

### Selector layer (`src/ir/select.ts`)

- Extended `ResolvedKind` to include `"any"` and `"void"`.
- `resolveParamType` now recognizes `AnyKeyword` → `"any"`.
- `resolveReturnType` now recognizes `VoidKeyword` → `"void"` and
  `AnyKeyword` → `"any"`.
- `whyNotIrClaimable` and `isIrClaimable` thread an `isVoidReturn` boolean
  down to `isPhase1StatementList` so void functions can have a non-return
  tail.
- `isPhase1Tail` now accepts:
  - bare `return;` (no expression) when `isVoidReturn`
  - `ExpressionStatement` (e.g. a call) when `isVoidReturn` — the lowerer
    synthesizes the implicit empty-values terminator after the side effects.

### Lowering layer (`src/codegen/index.ts`, `src/ir/integration.ts`, `src/ir/from-ast.ts`)

- `resolvePositionType` lowers `AnyKeyword` to `irVal({ kind: "externref" })`.
- The dispatcher's override map carries `returnType: IrType | null` where
  `null` means the function has zero Wasm result types.
- `compileIrPathFunctions`'s `IrTypeOverrideMap` and `calleeTypes` accept
  the nullable returnType.
- `lowerFunctionAstToIr` constructs the `IrFunctionBuilder` with `[]`
  result types when `returnType === null`. `LowerCtx.returnType` is now
  nullable.
- `lowerTail` accepts:
  - bare `return;` in void functions → `terminate({ kind: "return", values: [] })`
  - `ExpressionStatement` in void functions → lower for side effects, discard
    value, then implicit return with empty values.

### Graceful fallback for unsupported externref ops

`===`/`!==`/`==`/`!=` on externref operands throws a clean fallback error in
`lowerBinary` (the IR has no model for ref-equality between externrefs in
WasmGC; the legacy path handles it correctly via host string-compare /
boxed-number-compare). The function falls back to legacy without producing
invalid Wasm.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **`tests/issue-1228.test.ts`** covers selector + end-to-end:
   - 5 selector-layer assertions: any-param, void-return, void+early-return,
     any-param + void-return composition, and call-graph closure with a
     numeric kernel + void wrapper.
   - 4 end-to-end assertions: void-with-mutable-global, any-pass-through,
     void-with-bare-return, graceful-fallback for `===` on externref.
   - All 9 cases pass.

2. **No regression** in existing IR test suite. All 124 IR tests
   (`ir-frontend-widening`, `issue-1169a/d/o/p`, `ir-numeric-bool-equivalence`)
   still pass.

3. **Corpus measurement** confirms the rejection categories shifted away
   from void/any. Pre-fix histogram showed `return-type-not-resolvable=68%`
   + `param-type-not-resolvable=16%` + `body-shape-rejected=16%` = 100%
   fallback. Post-fix: those two reasons drop sharply, replaced by:
   - `body-shape-rejected: 56%` (now the dominant gap — driven by the
     test262 harness wrapper's identifier-assignment patterns
     `__assert_count = __assert_count + 1;` which Phase 1 doesn't accept)
   - `param-shape-rejected: 23%` (default/optional/rest params)
   - `call-graph-closure: 17%` (transitive drops)
   - `param-type-not-resolvable: 4%` (residual `any` cases without explicit
     annotation that propagation can't resolve)

   The headline 0% claim rate persists because the test262 wrapper has
   `__assert_count` identifier assignments that the Phase 1 shape gate
   doesn't accept yet — that's a distinct selector gap (would need a new
   issue to widen `isPhase1StatementList` to accept identifier `=`).

## Follow-up issues

- **Identifier assignment shape support** — the next biggest unlock for
  test262: `__assert_count = __assert_count + 1;` and similar bare-name
  assignments. Phase 1 currently only accepts `obj.field = expr`. File
  as a separate issue once #1228 lands.
- **externref `===`/`!==` lowering** — the IR currently throws on these
  and falls back; could lower to a host-import strict-equality. Defer
  until the body-shape gap is closed.

## Notes

The 70%+ claim-rate target from the original issue spec assumed `void`/`any`
were the only gaps; the corpus measurement post-fix shows that
identifier-assignment is the next dominant blocker. This PR delivers the
void/any widening fully and surfaces the remaining gap concretely so it
can be tackled next.
