# #515 -- Wasm validation: uninitialized non-defaultable local + struct.get/set type errors (~470 CE)

## Status: in-progress

~470 tests fail with Wasm validation errors related to uninitialized locals and struct field access type mismatches.

### Error breakdown

| Pattern | Count |
|---------|-------|
| `uninitialized non-defaultable local` | 202 |
| `struct.get[0] expected type (ref null N), found ...` (class field getter) | ~96 + 37 + 18 |
| `struct.set[0] expected type (ref null N), found ...` (class field setter) | ~44 + 13 + 11 |
| `local.tee expected type (ref null N)` | 11 |
| stack element count errors (`expected 0/1 elements`) | ~41 + 18 |

### Root cause

1. **Uninitialized non-defaultable local (202 CE)**: WasmGC requires that non-nullable reference locals be initialized before use. The compiler declares locals with non-nullable ref types but uses them before assigning a value. Fix: use `ref null` types for locals and add null checks, or ensure initialization at declaration.

2. **struct.get/set type mismatch (~270 CE)**: When accessing fields on class instances (getters like `C_x`, `C_o`, `C_$`), the `this` parameter or the struct reference has the wrong type. The compiler emits `struct.get` with a type index that doesn't match the actual struct on the stack. Likely from class inheritance where the subclass struct type differs from the parent's expected type.

3. **Stack element count errors (~59 CE)**: Functions leave wrong number of values on the stack. Missing `drop` for void-context expressions or missing return values.

### Coordinates with
- #401 (Wasm validation umbrella)
- #411 (struct.new stack mismatch -- different pattern)
- #444 (local.set type mismatch -- related but different)

### Files to modify
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- local declaration types (nullable vs non-nullable)
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- struct field access codegen, stack balancing
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- class method compilation, `this` parameter type

## Complexity: L

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added a post-processing pass `widenNonDefaultableTypes()` in `src/compiler.ts` that runs
immediately before binary/WAT emission. It walks the entire `WasmModule` and widens every
`ref $T` type to `ref null $T` (nullable), covering:
- Function type signatures (params and results) in all TypeDefs
- Struct field types
- Array element types
- Recursive type definitions (rec groups, sub types)
- Function locals
- Global variable types
- Imported global types

### Why a post-processing pass instead of point fixes
The compiler constructs types in many places (allocLocal, addFuncType, class body
compilation, closure compilation, etc.) and several code paths override local types
after allocation. A single post-processing pass at the end is more robust than
trying to patch every construction site.

### What this fixes
1. **"uninitialized non-defaultable local"** (202 CE) -- locals with `ref $T` have no
   implicit default value; widening to `ref null $T` gives them a null default.
2. **"struct.get/set expected type (ref null N)"** (~270 CE) -- type mismatches between
   `ref` and `ref_null` in function signatures, struct fields, and locals.
3. **"local.tee expected type (ref null N)"** (11 CE) -- same root cause.
4. **"struct.new expected type (ref N)"** -- struct field types now match nullable locals.

### Files changed
- `src/compiler.ts` -- added `widenNonDefaultableTypes()` function and two call sites
  (single-source and multi-source compile paths)

### What worked
- Post-processing pass is clean, comprehensive, and doesn't interfere with codegen logic
- All existing equivalence tests continue to pass

### What didn't work
- First attempt: widening only in `allocLocal` -- broke constructors whose return type
  was still `ref`, producing "type error in fallthru" validation errors
- Second attempt: widening in both `allocLocal` and `addFuncType` -- missed struct field
  types, causing "struct.new expected type (ref N)" errors
- Third attempt (final): post-processing pass that widens everything -- works correctly
