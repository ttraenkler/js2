# #909 -- Split codegen/index.ts into context, registry, collect, and api modules

## Problem

[src/codegen/index.ts](src/codegen/index.ts) is currently the largest architectural choke point in the compiler backend.

It mixes several responsibilities:

- public codegen entry points
- context and local-allocation utilities
- import/type/struct registration
- declaration collection
- helper/runtime synthesis
- function/class compilation support
- post-fixup logic

At more than 15k lines, it is difficult for a new collaborator to predict where a change belongs.

## Goal

Refactor `src/codegen/index.ts` into a small API surface plus focused internal modules with clear ownership.

## Requirements

1. Reduce `src/codegen/index.ts` to a thin orchestration/barrel layer
2. Introduce explicit submodules for:
   - context creation and shared backend types
   - registries for imports, function types, structs, arrays, strings, exceptions
   - AST collection passes for declarations/imports/externs/shapes
3. Ensure leaf modules no longer have to import a giant kitchen-sink backend file
4. Preserve current behavior and test coverage during the breakup
5. Add a short comment or doc block at the top of each new submodule stating its ownership

## Acceptance criteria

- `src/codegen/index.ts` is materially smaller and primarily orchestration
- context/registry/collect responsibilities live in separate files or folders
- contributors can find registration logic without reading unrelated statement/expression lowering
