## Problem (S45 finding, S45b fix)

Under `--target standalone` (native strings), an array literal that mixes a
string with a non-string primitive corrupts the `$AnyValue` **tag** of every
element — not just the visibly-wrong one:

```ts
const row = ["x", 1976];
typeof row[1]; // "string" — WRONG, should be "number"
"" + row[1]; // "1976" — the VALUE survived; only the tag was wrong
```

S45's reduction (`.tmp/s45/probe10.mts`, carried into this branch's
`.tmp/s45b/probe10.mts`) narrowed this to a single-module repro and named the
two Temporal test262 files it explains:
`test/built-ins/Temporal/PlainDate/from/argument-object-valid.js` and
`…/argument-string.js`, both failing with `SameValue(«null», «undefined»)`
inside `TemporalHelpers.assertPlainDate` after the corruption travels through
`for (const [input, ...expected] of tests)` destructuring + spread.

## Root cause

`row`'s checker type is `(string | number)[]` — TypeScript's default array
inference for a mixed-primitive literal without `as const`. `resolveWasmType`
(`src/codegen/index.ts`, the `tsType.isUnion()` arm,
`isHeterogeneousPrimitiveUnion`) maps that union to a `$AnyValue`-element vec.
The array LITERAL itself constructs a vec of **raw externref** elements (each
boxed by its own static type — `__box_number` for `1976`, a native-string cast
for `"x"`; `src/codegen/literals.ts`'s string-first / non-string-elem widening
guards, ~5544/~5794). Binding `row` to its declared type then WIDENS that
raw-externref vec into the `$AnyValue`-element vec via
`emitVecToVecBody` (`src/codegen/type-coercion.ts`), whose per-element
coercion called the generic `coerceType(externref, $AnyValue)` →
`boxToAny` (`src/codegen/value-tags.ts`).

`boxToAny`'s externref arm, under the `undefinedSingleton` regime (always
active in standalone), calls `__any_box_extern_s1`
(`src/codegen/any-boxing-helpers.ts`) — a **deliberately partial** classifier:
it only honestly recovers `null` (tag 0) and the `UNDEF_F64`-sentinel
`$BoxedNumber` (tag 1, "undefined"). Every OTHER externref — including an
utterly ordinary `$BoxedNumber` holding `1976`, or a `$BoxedBoolean` — falls to
its documented fallback: the #1888 "box the externref as tag-5 string" lie.
That default is intentional there (its own comment records a −788/−794
standalone-pass regression from a prior attempt to make it universally
honest), so **`boxToAny`'s shared default must not change**.

#3055 already solved the identical problem for the `===`/`==` operand seam
(`src/codegen/coercion-engine.ts`'s `emitAnyEqOperands`) by calling
`ensureAnyFromExternHelper(ctx)` (`src/codegen/any-helpers.ts:520`,
`__any_from_extern`) **at that one call site** instead of going through
`boxToAny`. That helper classifies `$BoxedNumber`/i31 → tag 3, `$BoxedBoolean`
→ tag 4, BEFORE falling back to tag 5 — even in its non-`forceHonest` mode — so
it recovers every tag the array-literal widen can produce.

## Fix

`emitVecToVecBody` (`src/codegen/type-coercion.ts`, the per-element copy loop
used for every vec→vec projection, not just array literals): when the source
element is a raw `externref` and the destination vec's element type is
`$AnyValue` (`isAnyValue(dstVec.elemType, ctx)`), call
`ensureAnyFromExternHelper(ctx)` directly instead of the generic `coerceType`.

```ts
} else if (
  needsCoerce &&
  srcKind === "externref" &&
  isAnyValue(dstVec.elemType, ctx) &&
  ensureAnyFromExternHelper(ctx) !== undefined
) {
  fctx.body.push({ op: "call", funcIdx: ensureAnyFromExternHelper(ctx)! });
} else if (needsCoerce) {
  coerceType(ctx, fctx, readElemType, dstVec.elemType);
}
```

**Scoping, matching #3055's own per-site discipline (do NOT flip the global
default):**

- `ensureAnyFromExternHelper` returns `undefined` when
  `ctx.targetProfile.semanticProviders !== "native-first"` — i.e. it is a
  no-op for `gc`/js-host targets, so this arm can never fire there and that
  lane stays byte-identical (confirmed: the `--target gc` control in the
  witness test below reaches the SAME `coerceType` path as before this PR).
- The substitution is scoped to `emitVecToVecBody`'s externref→`$AnyValue`
  element widen specifically (gated on `srcKind === "externref"` AND
  `isAnyValue(dstVec.elemType, ctx)`) — every other `coerceType` call site
  in the compiler (including the ones `boxToAny`'s own tag-5 default still
  serves) is untouched.
- `boxToAny`'s externref arm and `__any_box_extern_s1` are **not edited** —
  the −788/−794 regression risk lives entirely in that shared default, and
  this fix never reaches it for the corrected code path.

## Witness — `tests/issue-6631-mixed-array-element-typeof-tag.test.ts`

9 tests (single-module `compileMulti` + `instantiateLinkedProject`, no
harness): 5 fix-witnessing (fail on base, pass on fix — `typeof` on the number
element, the string element, the boolean element, a for-of destructure +
spread rest element, and the `typeof === "number"` strict-eq control), 4
controls that already passed on base and still pass on fix (all-string array,
all-number array, the raw string-concat value check, and `--target gc`
byte-identity). Base-revert (file-copy A/B, `.tmp/s45b/type-coercion.{base,fix}.ts`)
confirmed 5/9 failing on base, 4/9 passing (the controls) — exactly the
predicted split.

```
npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 tests/issue-6631-mixed-array-element-typeof-tag.test.ts
# 9 passed (9) on fix; 5 failed / 4 passed on base revert
```

## Real-corpus proof — this fix does NOT close the two named Temporal rows

Two rows S45 named as explained by this defect:

- `test/built-ins/Temporal/PlainDate/from/argument-object-valid.js`
- `test/built-ins/Temporal/PlainDate/from/argument-string.js`

Both still fail identically on the fix, with the SAME error string as on base:

```
Test262Error: Expected SameValue(«null», «undefined») to be true
```

(prewarm: `JS2WASM_TEMPORAL_CACHE=s45b-fix node scripts/prewarm-temporal-provider.mjs
--target standalone` → `cacheHit=false key=a11c84e556193459`, confirming a fresh
provider build against this branch's compiler; both rows re-run via
`runTest262File(file, "Temporal", 30000, "standalone")` after the quickjs eval
adapter was rebuilt to match the fresh compiler bundle.)

**Root-cause correction**: the SameValue(null, undefined) failure traces to
`TemporalHelpers.canonicalizeCalendarEra(date.calendarId, date.era)` —
`date.era` is a **class-instance field read** (`era: string | undefined`),
NOT an array-element read. `isHeterogeneousPrimitiveUnion` (the gate this
fix's `emitVecToVecBody` substitution — and `resolveWasmType`'s union arm
that feeds it — depend on) requires **≥ 2 distinct non-nullish primitive
kinds**; `string | undefined` has exactly ONE non-nullish kind (`string`), so
it never reaches the `$AnyValue`-vec / `boxToAny` path this fix touches at
all. A follow-up probe (`.tmp/s45b/probe11.mts`, "class field union") isolates
a DIFFERENT, adjacent defect on this same branch: a class field typed
`string | undefined`, assigned the value `undefined` in the constructor, reads
back `typeof d.era === "object"` (should be `"undefined"`) — a null/undefined
CONFLATION at a field-storage coercion site this fix never touches. That is
the more likely proximate cause of the two Temporal rows' `SameValue(null,
undefined)` mismatch and needs its own S46-generation investigation (own
coercion site, not `emitVecToVecBody`).

**This PR is filed anyway** because #6631 (the array-literal `typeof`-tag
corruption) is independently real, independently witnessed (base-fail /
fix-pass, file-copy A/B confirmed), and independently fixed — it does not
depend on resolving the Temporal rows to be worth landing. The Temporal rows
remain open; see `## S45/S45b findings` on #5383 for the fuller writeup and
the next probe's exact findings.

## S46b criterion-4 battery (2026-09-18)

S46b ran the full four-family / must-not-move / corpus-byte / equivalence
battery on top of both this fix AND #6632's fix together (S46's tip,
`0ed8016645`) — the battery cannot isolate #6631 alone since #6632 is stacked
directly on top of it and both are needed to attempt the real rows. Full
tables in `plan/issues/6632-class-field-undefined-union-typeof-nullish.md`'s
"## S46b findings" section. Summary: four-family 433→435 pass (0 pass→fail, 2
fail→pass), must-not-move A–D 0 pass→fail (6 fail→pass total), corpus byte
A/B 0 flips, equivalence 22/1720/22 unchanged. One non-clean bucket
(E-linked, Proxy/Reflect first-300, 10 pass→fail) was proven via file-copy
revert of every file either fix touches to be pre-existing/environmental, not
caused by this fix or #6632's.
