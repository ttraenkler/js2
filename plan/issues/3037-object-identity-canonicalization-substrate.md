# #3037 — object-identity canonicalization substrate (standalone)

**This is a substrate / strategy spec, not a single PR.** It decides WHERE the
compiler canonicalizes object identity so that the same logical object always
yields one `ref.eq`-identical GC ref, which is the foundation the #3027 keystone
(the ~1,552-test `$Object`-dynamic-reader residual) and the #2175 V2-S3b/S3c
reader-arm sit on top of. It composes with — and does not fork — the landed
S3a reconciliation arm (#2175, `__any_strict_eq`) and the #2963 singleton /
per-brand-global anchors.

Verified against `upstream/main @ 27bfb9417` (V2-S3a landed). Line/symbol
anchors are from that HEAD; re-grep if drifted.

## The measured problem (traced, not narrative)

In standalone mode a JS object reaches `===` through the `$AnyValue` boxing
layer under **two representations of the same reference**:

- **tag-6** (`refval`, field 3): the raw GC ref, via `boxToAny`'s kind-`ref`
  arm → `__any_box_ref` (`value-tags.ts:228`). This is what a *syntactic* read
  (`RegExp.prototype.exec`, a struct field, a directly-held value) produces.
- **tag-5** (`externval`, field 4): the SAME ref externref-wrapped, via
  `boxToAny`'s kind-`externref` arm → `__any_box_string` (`value-tags.ts:213`).
  This is what a *dynamic* read produces: `__extern_get` returns
  `extern.convert_any(e.value)` (`object-runtime.ts:1138`), an externref, which
  the consumer boxes with the blanket tag-5 arm — the descriptor `.value`, an
  array/vec element, any dynamic member read.

`__any_strict_eq` (`any-helpers.ts:2233`) has three relevant regions:

1. **top `ref.eq` on the two boxes** (`:2242`) — same $AnyValue struct → 1.
   Only fires when both operands are the *identical box*.
2. **cross-tag arm** (`tagA != tagB`, `:2291-2355`) — the **landed V2-S3a
   reconciliation**: recover each operand's payload (refval if non-null, else
   `any.convert_extern(externval)`) to a common `eqref` and `ref.eq`. This
   fixes **tag-6 × tag-5** (mixed) object identity. Standalone/wasi-gated.
3. **same-tag tag-5 arm** (`:2418-2436`, `tag5ValueEqThen` /
   `tag5StringEqThen`) — GUARDED string-CONTENT compare (`ref.test $AnyString`
   on both; `0` for non-strings).

**The residual that killed V2-S3b:** two objects read through the **same**
dynamic reader are BOTH boxed tag-5 → they hit region (3), the same-tag tag-5
arm, whose guard fails for objects → **returns 0** for genuinely-identical
objects. Concretely (all standalone, verified in the V2-S2/S3a logs):

- `gOPD(p,"exec").value === gOPD(p,"exec").value` → **0** (both reads tag-5).
- `const o:any={z:1}; f(o); /* two reader reads of o */` → **0**.
- The 20-test `Array.indexOf` object-element cluster (#2734) was this class in
  the search helper; the general `===` surface is still exposed.

### Why the obvious patches are ALL unsound (the floor minefield)

Region (3) — the tag-5 same-tag arm — is the single most floor-regression-prone
site in the compiler, because **tag-5 is triple-overloaded**: its `externval`
holds genuine strings, `$BoxedNumber` carriers, AND non-string GC
objects/closures (`any-helpers.ts:1566-1570`). Two independent attempts to give
it object-identity are recorded as hard floor regressions:

- Adding a `#2585` object-identity `ref.eq` arm (and a `#2040` numeric arm) to
  the tag-5 same-tag classifier regressed **−162** (ejected from the standalone
  highwater floor): it flips tag-5 boxed-VALUE equality that the
  destructuring / generator-iterator lowering implicitly relies on
  (`any-helpers.ts:1574-1587`).
- Flipping the generic `boxToAny` externref arm (`value-tags.ts:187-213`) to
  honest classification (`honestAnyBoxing`) regressed **−788 / −794**: the
  test262 harness comparator `assert.sameValue` / `isSameValue` routes ALL
  `any` operands through the externref ABI and depends on main's tag-5
  box-the-externref behaviour (`value-tags.ts:206-212`).
- Boxing operands to tag-6 **at the `===` operand-site** (V2-S3b's attempt)
  regressed **−299** deterministically: forcing internalize-then-`ref.eq` at
  the comparison breaks exactly the harness-comparator tag-5 identity above.

**The lesson (the thesis of this spec):** identity CANNOT be patched at the
equality operand-site, and the tag-5 same-tag arm CANNOT be taught object
identity. Identity must be canonicalized **where values are read/produced**, so
that a GC object never reaches `===` boxed tag-5 in the first place — objects
box **tag-6** (identity in `refval`), tag-5 stays **strings-only**, and the
already-correct tag-6 same-tag `ref.eq` arm (`any-helpers.ts:2404-2416`) does
the work with **zero** new equality-site risk.

### Grounding fact the strategy rests on

In pure standalone there are **no host externrefs** — every externref is
`extern.convert_any` of a GC ref (native strings are `$AnyString` GC arrays,
not `wasm:js-string`). Therefore `any.convert_extern ∘ extern.convert_any` is
the identity on GC refs (WasmGC internalize/externalize is bijective for
GC-origin externrefs). So a stored `e.value` GC ref read back through the
reader and re-internalized IS `ref.eq`-identical to the original — **the ONLY
way identity is lost is a production site that (a) mints a FRESH GC allocation
for the same logical object, or (b) boxes the ref tag-5 so `===` lands in the
overloaded same-tag arm.** Both are production-site defects, not equality-site
defects. (In host mode, host externrefs are genuinely non-`eq` and the host
`isSameValue` owns identity — every arm here is `ctx.standalone`-gated and host
stays byte-identical.)

---

## Implementation Plan (strategy decision + slices)

### Options considered

#### Option A — canonical-ref INTERN table (identity map)

A module structure mapping "logical object key" → the one canonical GC ref, so
every read of the same logical object returns it.

- **Where/keyed on what:** an intern table only helps objects that have an
  *external* identity key BEFORE you hold the canonical ref (chicken/egg: a
  plain user object simply IS its GC ref — there is no prior key to intern on).
  It is well-defined only for **synthesized / reflective** objects that are
  materialized on demand: builtin protos (key = brand), builtin method/getter
  values (key = `(brand, member)`), ctor carriers (key = name), well-known
  symbol carriers (key = id).
- **Memory cost:** for the synthesized classes it is O(distinct reflective
  objects the program touches) — small, and it is **already implemented** as
  per-key module globals: `__native_proto_<brand>` (#2175 S1), the #2963
  `pushBuiltinFnSingletonValueInstrs` per-`(brand,member)` global, the #3006
  ctor carriers, `ensureSymbolCarrier`. A *general* user-object intern map would
  be a per-allocation hash table (large, and pointless — see below).
- **Soundness on the #2661 flipped cases:** fixes `getPrototypeOf` (returns the
  per-brand global) and synthesized-value identity. Does **nothing** for
  aliased user-object array elements or a plain user object round-tripped
  through `__extern_get` — those have no synthesized key.
- **Verdict:** A is the correct MODEL for synthesized objects and is largely
  DONE. It is not, and should not become, a general user-object substrate.

#### Option B — externref-identity-preserving equality (keep operands externref through ===)

- **Why it looks attractive:** the tag-5 path "already preserves" host identity
  in host mode; keep `===` at the externref layer and never unbox.
- **Why it is unsound / insufficient:** WasmGC has **no `ref.eq` on
  externref** — to compare two externrefs you must `any.convert_extern` them,
  which is precisely the operand-site internalization that regressed −299, and
  for genuine host externrefs internalize yields non-`eq` refs (unreliable
  identity). It also does not touch `getPrototypeOf` / reflective visibility at
  all (those are production, not equality). B collapses into either the
  forbidden operand-site tag-6 approach or a no-op.
- **Verdict:** REJECTED. This is the class the task forbids.

#### Option C — canonicalize at the production / box site (RECOMMENDED)

Guarantee that every logical object has exactly ONE canonical GC ref and that
every read path yields THAT ref boxed **tag-6** (never a fresh allocation,
never tag-5). Then S3a's landed machinery (tag-6 same-tag `ref.eq`, plus the
cross-tag reconciliation for any transitional mixed pair) answers identity
with **no equality-site change**.

- **Soundness on ALL #2661 flipped cases:** each reduces to "same logical
  object ⇒ same canonical GC ref, boxed tag-6":
  - `gOPD(p,"m").value` vs `p.m`: both resolve to the ONE stored `e.value` /
    #2963 singleton, boxed tag-6 → `ref.eq` true.
  - `arr[0]` vs `arr[1]` aliasing one object: the array stores ONE ref; both
    reads return it boxed tag-6 → true (S3a already flips this for the mixed
    case; C removes the tag-5 same-tag exposure entirely).
  - `getPrototypeOf`: returns the per-brand `$NativeProto` global (Option-A
    anchor) → true.
- **Standalone floor risk:** the risk is *localized to the enumerated
  production sites* and is byte-inert everywhere else. The generic `boxToAny`
  externref arm (the −788 chokepoint) and the tag-5 same-tag arm (the −162
  chokepoint) are **NOT touched** — that is the whole point.
- **Blast radius:** the dynamic-read consumer sites (standalone) + the reader
  natives; host/gc lanes and every non-reflective program are byte-identical.
- **Enables V2-S3c + the guard-flip:** once objects the reader produces are
  tag-6-canonical, the V2-S3b `$NativeProto`/closed-shape reader arms can land
  WITHOUT any `===` change (the exact thing that killed the last attempt), and
  V2-S3c's instance-chain arm + the STRICT-IR guard-flip stack on top.

**Recommendation: Option C**, implemented as scoped production-site
representation canonicalization, resting on S3a for the transitional window and
folding Option A's memoization only for synthesized anchors. Reject B. Never
touch the tag-5 same-tag arm or the generic externref boxing arm.

### The invariant this substrate establishes (state it, gate on it)

> **INV-1 (representation canonicalization):** in `ctx.standalone`, a GC object
> value flowing into an `any` slot via a dynamic reader or descriptor synthesis
> is boxed **tag-6** (`refval`); tag-5 (`externval`) is reserved for genuine
> `$AnyString` strings (+ the legacy `$BoxedNumber` carrier). Equivalently:
> `typeof x === "object"/"function"` values never reach `===` boxed tag-5.

> **INV-2 (allocation canonicalization):** a production site never mints a fresh
> GC allocation for a logical object that already has a canonical ref (stored
> `e.value`, #2963 singleton, per-brand proto global, ctor carrier). Reads
> thread the stored/anchored ref; they never re-wrap into a new struct.

INV-1 makes `===` land in the tag-6 arm (safe); INV-2 makes the tag-6 arm's
`ref.eq` actually true. Both are production-side; neither touches `===`.

### Sub-slice decomposition (each byte-inert-off-path; each merge_group floor-gated)

> **Every slice MUST validate on the full `merge_group` + `check-standalone-highwater.mjs`**, never a scoped sweep — this is THE floor-regression minefield (documented −162 / −299 / −788 / −794 / −7228 incidents). Each slice is `ctx.standalone`-gated and must keep `scripts/prove-emit-identity.mjs` (the 39-hash corpus) IDENTICAL for host/gc and for any module that never pulls the dynamic reader.

- **CS0 (S) — characterization + invariant lock (byte-inert).** No codegen
  change. Add a standalone characterization suite that pins the residual and
  the invariant as a table: (a) `gOPD(p,"exec").value === gOPD(p,"exec").value`
  → currently `.toBe(0)` (the boundary that later slices flip to `1`);
  (b) two dynamic reads of one aliased user object → `.toBe(0)`;
  (c) anti-vacuity negatives that must STAY 0 (`{x:1} === {x:1}`, distinct
  strings, `exec !== test`); (d) a "reader value tag" probe asserting an
  object read dynamically is NOT `typeof "string"` (proves it should be tag-6).
  This slice makes the flip auditable and prevents a coincidental-pass
  (builtin-proto surfaces hide coincidental passes — use inject/contrast).

- **CS1 (M) — production-site honest object boxing at the dynamic-reader
  consumers.** THE keystone substrate slice. Enumerate every standalone site
  that takes a dynamic-reader externref result (`__extern_get`, vec/array
  element read, descriptor `.value`/`.get` synthesis) and boxes it to `any`,
  and route it through a **scoped honest classify** — `$AnyString` → tag-5,
  else eq-castable GC → tag-6 — instead of the blanket `__any_box_string`. The
  honest classifier ALREADY exists as `__any_from_extern`'s `honest` arm
  (`any-helpers.ts:427-469`, `$AnyString`→tag-5, other eq→tag-6); reuse it —
  do **not** mint a second classifier. **Hard constraint:** touch ONLY the
  enumerated dynamic-read consumers; do **NOT** flip the generic `boxToAny`
  externref arm (`value-tags.ts:187-213`, the −788 chokepoint) and do **NOT**
  add anything to the tag-5 same-tag arm (the −162 chokepoint).
  - *Files:* the dynamic member-read lowerings in `property-access.ts` /
    `element-access` that box an `__extern_get` result to `any`; the #2885
    gOPD descriptor synthesis in `calls.ts` (store the raw ref, box tag-6);
    the vec/array element→any read path. Grep for `__any_box_string` /
    `__any_box_extern` reached from a reader result under `ctx.standalone`.
  - *Gate:* CS0's boundary (a),(b) flip `0 → 1`; a string read dynamically
    still concatenates (`const o:any={s:"ab"}; o.s + o.s === "abab"`, tag-5
    intact); anti-vacuity negatives stay 0; `typeof (dynamically-read object)`
    unchanged. Full merge_group floor + prove-emit-identity green.
  - *Floor-risk: HIGH* (adjacent to the harness-comparator chokepoint). The
    scoping to enumerated sites is the safety boundary — a reviewer MUST
    confirm the generic externref arm and the tag-5 same-tag arm are untouched
    (diff-audit gate).

- **CS2 (S) — synthesized-anchor audit + lock (Option A completion).** Confirm
  every synthesized reflective object is memoized to ONE canonical ref and add
  swap-guarded identity tests where missing: protos (`__native_proto_<brand>`),
  method/getter values (#2963 singleton — done V2-S2), ctor carriers (#3006),
  well-known symbol carriers. Fill any gap where a synthesis path still mints
  fresh (INV-2). Mostly audit + regression-lock; no new mechanism.
  - *Gate:* `RegExp.prototype === RegExp.prototype`;
    `X.prototype.m === gOPD(X.prototype,"m").value`;
    `getPrototypeOf(Int8Array.prototype) === %TypedArray%.prototype` (once the
    chain fields are filled — may defer the last to V2-S3b). Swap-guards prove
    discrimination.

- **CS3 (L) — V2-S3b reader-arm MOP, RE-ENABLED on top of CS1.** This is the
  #2175 v2 C3 reader arm (`$NativeProto`/`$Object`/closed-shape step-3/4 arms
  across the 7 reader natives) that died last attempt. It lands here as a
  **consumer** of the substrate: because CS1 guarantees any object the reader
  produces is tag-6-canonical, the reader arm needs **zero** `===` change (the
  exact thing that caused −299). The reader arm's raw-anyref `$PropEntry.value`
  carrier (v2 D4) + CS1's honest boxing together make
  `const p:any = RegExp.prototype; p.exec === RegExp.prototype.exec` hold at the
  runtime layer. Keep on its own CI evidence (the v2 spec's "do not fold S3+S5"
  rule stands). *This slice is #2175 V2-S3b; #3037 is its precondition, not its
  replacement.* Owned by the #2175 wave; listed here to make the dependency
  explicit.

**Order:** CS0 → CS1 → CS2 (CS2 parallel-able with CS1) → CS3 (= V2-S3b).
CS1 is the substrate keystone; V2-S3b/S3c and the STRICT-IR guard-flip stack on
CS1. Do not attempt CS3 before CS1 lands — that reproduces the #2661 death.

### Edge cases

- **Native strings must NOT mis-box tag-6.** The honest classifier tests
  `ref.test $AnyString` FIRST (`any-helpers.ts:430-443`); a string read
  dynamically stays tag-5. CS1 must reuse that ordered classifier, never a bare
  `ref.test $eq`.
- **`$BoxedNumber` carriers** parked in tag-5 externval (`any-helpers.ts:1567`)
  must stay tag-5 (numeric-class arm + `__any_to_f64` recovery depend on it) —
  the honest classifier's `$AnyString`-first / eq-second order already excludes
  `$BoxedNumber` from the tag-6 arm only if `$BoxedNumber` is not `eq`-castable;
  verify `$BoxedNumber`'s heap type is not an `eq` subtype that would wrongly
  take the tag-6 arm, else add an explicit `$BoxedNumber`→tag-5 pre-test.
  **(Open — must be checked in CS1 review; a mis-tag here re-breaks numeric
  `===`.)**
- **Host mode / gc lane byte-identity.** Every arm `ctx.standalone`-gated;
  host `isSameValue` (#1888) and the host externref proxy identity untouched.
- **Frozen / `Object.create(null)` objects** keep current semantics — CS1 only
  changes the TAG of the boxed result, not the reader's lookup.
- **Transitional mixed pairs** (one operand tag-6 from CS1, one still tag-5
  from an un-migrated site) are covered by S3a's cross-tag reconciliation arm —
  so partial CS1 coverage never regresses, it only under-fixes. This is why CS1
  can land incrementally per consumer site if needed.

### What this spec explicitly does NOT do

- Does NOT patch identity at the `===` operand-site (proven unsound, −299).
- Does NOT add an object-identity arm to the tag-5 same-tag classifier (−162).
- Does NOT flip the generic `boxToAny` externref arm / `honestAnyBoxing`
  globally (−788/−794).
- Does NOT build a general user-object intern map (pointless — user objects are
  their GC ref; only synthesized objects need Option-A memoization, already
  done).
- Does NOT change host mode; no new host imports.
- Does NOT implement the reader-arm MOP itself (that is #2175 V2-S3b / CS3,
  which this substrate unblocks).

### Risks & honest assessment

1. **CS1 is genuinely hard and floor-risky.** It sits one arm away from the two
   worst floor-regression chokepoints in the codebase. The mitigation is strict
   scoping (enumerated consumers only) + a mandatory diff-audit that the generic
   and same-tag arms are untouched + full merge_group evidence. Estimate: L in
   care even though M in code size.
2. **`$BoxedNumber` eq-castability** (edge case above) is the single most likely
   silent regression — it must be settled with a `ref.test` probe on current
   main BEFORE writing CS1, not assumed.
3. **Enumeration completeness.** If a dynamic-read consumer is missed, that path
   stays tag-5 and under-fixes (safe via S3a, not a regression) — but the #3027
   number won't fully move until all consumers migrate. Expect CS1 to iterate
   per consumer family (property read, element read, descriptor synthesis).
4. **The bijection assumption** (no host externrefs in standalone) is load-
   bearing. If any host-string-mode externref leaks into a `ctx.standalone`
   read, the honest classifier could mis-tag. The `$AnyString`-first ordering
   plus standalone gating contains this, but CS1 review must confirm no
   host-string leak path reaches the migrated consumers.

**Bottom line:** the object-identity foundation under #3027 is a
**production-site representation-canonicalization** problem (Option C), not an
equality problem. The landed S3a arm already handles the mixed-tag window; the
missing piece is CS1 — making dynamic-reader object values box tag-6 at the
enumerated production sites so they never enter the overloaded tag-5 same-tag
arm. Once CS1 lands, the V2-S3b reader-arm re-lands with no `===` change and the
#3027 keystone + guard-flip stack on top. The hardness is concentrated in CS1's
floor-adjacency, managed by strict scoping and merge_group-only validation.

## RE-SCOPE (2026-07-05, arch) — the `any`-object CARRIER, not the reader site

### What CS0 actually measured (correcting the reader-only premise)

1. **There is no migratable "reader production site."** A temporary
   `emitAnyEqOperands` probe (`coercion-engine.ts:454`) confirmed the `===`
   operand of a dynamic `any`-member read has ValType **externref**
   (`isAnyValue = false`): the reader returns a **bare externref**, and tag-5 is
   decided **downstream** at the operand-marshalling site —
   `emitAnyEqOperands` → `coerceType(externref → $AnyValue)` → the generic
   `boxToAny` externref arm → `__any_box_string` (`value-tags.ts:213`). That
   site *is* the #1888 **−788 chokepoint** / the **−299** operand site this
   spec already forbids. "Box at the reader" has no site to target.

2. **The defect is UNIVERSAL, not reader-specific.**
   `const inner: any = {z:1}; inner === inner` → **0** — an object is not `===`
   to *itself*. Any object value materialised in a contextually-`any` position
   is carried as **externref** and boxed **tag-5**. The controls prove the fix
   direction: a *typed* object (`const inner = {z:1}`) stays a raw `ref $Object`
   → `__any_box_ref` → **tag-6** → the tag-6 `ref.eq` arm answers identity
   (`pos1`/`pos3`/`pos4` all `1`; `arr[0]===arr[1]` on a typed `any[]` already
   `1`). So the fix must convert the **externref** carrier of an any-object into
   the **tag-6** carrier the typed path already uses — narrow reader-site boxing
   would not move #3027.

3. **`$BoxedNumber` eq-castability is settled (must respect):**
   `__box_number_struct` (`index.ts:11690`) is a plain WasmGC struct → an `eq`
   subtype → `ref.test (ref eq)` returns 1 for it. A **bare** eq classifier
   would mis-route a boxed number to tag-6 and re-break numeric `===`. Any
   carrier boxing MUST reuse the **FULL** `__any_from_extern` classifier, which
   peels `$BoxedNumber`→tag-3 (`any-helpers.ts:497-512`) and `$BoxedBoolean`→
   tag-4 (`:513-528`) via `ref.test nativeBox*TypeIdx` **before** the
   `$AnyString`-first / eq-second `fallbackStringAny` classification (`:427-469`)
   — **never** the bare `fallbackStringAny` eq fragment.

### The two candidate carrier mechanisms (floor-risk for EACH)

Both make an any-object reach `===` as tag-6. They differ in WHERE the tag is
decided.

#### Mechanism A — honest classification at the externref→`$AnyValue` boxing seam

Make `coerceType(externref → $AnyValue)` (equivalently the generic `boxToAny`
externref arm, i.e. the `honestAnyBoxing` classification) route objects to tag-6
instead of the blanket `__any_box_string` tag-5.

- **Coverage:** total in one edit — every any-object funnels through this seam
  at `===`.
- **Floor risk: SEVERE — this is the forbidden class.** The seam is exactly
  where the test262 harness comparator (`assert.sameValue`/`isSameValue`) marshals
  its `any` operands; flipping it is the measured **−788/−794** (global honest
  flip) and **−299** (operand-site tag-6, V2-S3b's death). It cannot be scoped
  to "objects only at ===" without still being the `===` operand site, because
  the harness comparison *is* an `===` over any operands. **REJECT** — this is
  the operand-site the spec forbids, re-discovered.

#### Mechanism B — canonical `any`-object carrier (upstream tag-6 production) — RECOMMENDED

Never externalize an object into an `any` slot. At each site where a GC-ref
value is *produced into* an `any`-typed slot, carry it as a **`ref $AnyValue`
tag-6** box (the typed path's representation) rather than an externref, reusing
the FULL `__any_from_extern` classifier. Objects then flow as `$AnyValue`
(`isAnyValue = true`); at `===`, `emitAnyEqOperands` skips the coercion seam
entirely (line 458/463 `isAnyValue` guard) and the tag-6 `ref.eq` arm answers
identity. **The generic externref arm (−788) and the `===` operand site (−299)
are both untouched — the change is at value-production-INTO-any, upstream of
equality.**

- **Coverage:** per production-site; grows as sites migrate.
- **Floor risk: MODERATE and localizable.** It changes the ValType a producing
  site hands to the any-flow (externref → `ref $AnyValue`). Blast radius = the
  non-`===` consumers of that value (method call, string concat, host handoff),
  which must accept `$AnyValue` and `coerceType` back to externref on demand —
  `coerceType($AnyValue → externref)` already exists (`:1663-1664`,
  `extern.convert_any` of refval/externval), so the round-trip is in place.
  **Partial coverage is SAFE by construction:** a migrated tag-6 operand paired
  with an un-migrated tag-5 operand of the *same* object hits S3a's cross-tag
  reconciliation arm (`any-helpers.ts:2291-2355`) → `ref.eq` → 1 (standalone
  internalize is bijective), so no half-migration ever regresses — it only
  under-fixes. This is what makes B decomposable and merge_group-gateable.

**Recommendation: Mechanism B.** A is the clean single-site fix but lands
squarely on the −788/−299 mine; B trades one clean site for a wider but
*floor-safe* set of production sites, each independently gateable and each
never-regressing under S3a.

### Exact `any`-object-carrier box sites (Mechanism B targets)

The broken sites are precisely those that produce **externref-into-any** where
the typed path would produce `ref`→tag-6. Enumerated from CS0's FLIP-TARGETs:

1. **Object/array literal in a contextually-`any` position** (`case c`, `case e`):
   the object-literal / array-literal lowering, when the target/contextual type
   is `any`/externref, externalizes instead of boxing tag-6. Emit the
   `ref $Object` and box via the full classifier. *This is the tightest,
   lowest-risk site — start here.*
2. **Dynamic `any`-member / element read result** (`case a`, `case b`, `case e`,
   `case num-lit`): the property-access / element-access lowering for an
   `any`-typed access returns the `__extern_get` externref bare. When the static
   result type is `any` and the value flows into an any context, box the result
   to `$AnyValue` tag-6 at the read expression (honest classifier). *Highest
   breadth — the bulk of #3027 — split per read family (member / element /
   descriptor `.value`).*
3. **`Object.getPrototypeOf` / reflective producers returning externref**
   (`case d`): return the per-brand `$NativeProto` global boxed tag-6 (composes
   with CS2's synthesized-anchor audit).
4. **`any` param binding / `any` return / `any[]` element store** — verify these
   already carry tag-6 (the `pos1/pos3/pos4` controls pass, so the typed→any
   path is fine); only add coverage if a measured case regresses.

### Re-scoped slices (each merge_group-floor-gated; partial coverage safe via S3a)

- **CS0 (S) — DONE (PR #2683).** Characterization + invariant lock; byte-inert;
  `prove-emit-identity` 39/39. 5 FLIP-TARGETs (`0`), 10 INVARIANTs.
- **CS1a (M) — object-literal-into-`any` carrier.** Site (1). Box a
  contextually-`any` object/array literal to `$AnyValue` tag-6 via the FULL
  `__any_from_extern` classifier. *Gate:* `case c` (`inner===inner`) → 1;
  `neg1` distinct-shape stays 0; `str3` string stays tag-5/`typeof "string"`;
  `num-lit` stays 1. Full merge_group + `check-standalone-highwater`.
- **CS1b (L, decompose per read family) — dynamic-read-into-`any` carrier.**
  Site (2), split: (i) member read, (ii) element read, (iii) gOPD `.value`/`.get`.
  Box the any-typed read result to tag-6 at the read expression; consumers
  `coerceType` back to externref on demand. *Gate per sub-slice:* the matching
  FLIP-TARGET (`a`/`b`/`e`) → 1; all INVARIANTs hold; a non-`===` consumer probe
  (`o.m()`, `o.s + o.s`) still works. Merge_group only.
- **CS1c (S) — `getPrototypeOf`/reflective producer carrier.** Site (3);
  composes with CS2. *Gate:* `case d` → 1.
- **CS2 (S) — synthesized-anchor audit + lock** (unchanged from above).
- **CS3 (L) — V2-S3b reader-arm MOP**, now stacked on the carrier (unchanged;
  owned by the #2175 wave). With CS1 the reader-arm needs no `===` change.

**Order:** CS1a → CS1b(i) → CS1b(ii) → CS1b(iii) → CS1c → CS2 → CS3. CS1a is the
lowest-risk beachhead that flips the pivotal `inner===inner` case and proves the
carrier mechanism end-to-end before the higher-breadth read-family slices.

### Floor-risk verdict

Mechanism **B** is the only path that does not re-detonate the −788/−299 mine.
Its residual risk is the ValType change at each producing site (a value that was
externref becomes `ref $AnyValue`), contained by (a) the pre-existing
`coerceType($AnyValue → externref)` round-trip for non-`===` consumers, (b) S3a
making every half-migrated pair a safe `1`, and (c) per-site merge_group
gating. **CS1a is low risk; CS1b is the genuine breadth risk** (it changes the
result ValType of the most common dynamic-read lowerings) and must land per read
family with isolated merge_group evidence — never folded, never scoped-swept.
Mechanism A is recorded here only to document *why* the obvious one-site fix is
forbidden.
