# #1113 — Object.defineProperty / property descriptors (106 tests)

## Status: open (moved from wont-fix)

Previously labeled "won't implement" — reassessed as achievable for common cases.

## Approach

Most uses set simple value/writable/enumerable. Compile-time resolution when descriptor is a literal object:
- `value` → set the field
- `get`/`set` → compile as getter/setter (already supported)
- `writable`/`configurable`/`enumerable` → per-struct descriptor bitfield

`Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` reads the bitfield.

## Complexity: M
