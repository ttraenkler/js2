# Issue 41: typeof as Expression

## Status: done

## Summary
Support `typeof x` as a standalone expression returning a type string. Currently `typeof` only works inside comparisons like `typeof x === "number"`.

## Motivation
`typeof` as an expression is used in logging, switch statements, and passing type information.

## Design

### Standalone typeof
For statically typed values, emit the string constant directly:
- `f64` → `"number"`
- `i32` boolean → `"boolean"`
- String externref → `"string"`
- Struct ref → `"object"`

For `externref` (unknown type), call a host helper `__typeof(val: externref): string`.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — handle `TypeOfExpression` standalone (~30 lines)
- `src/runtime.ts` — add `__typeof` host import (~10 lines)
- `tests/typeof-expr.test.ts` (~40 lines)

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- `typeof x` returns the correct type string
- Works as standalone expression (not just in comparisons)
- `const t = typeof x` works
- All existing tests still pass
