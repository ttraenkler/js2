# #1342 — JSON.stringify: replacer function, toJSON method, property-list filter

## Problem

`built-ins/JSON/stringify`: **17 / 66 pass (25.8%)** — 42 assertion_fail, 2 type_error,
2 runtime_error, 1 other, 1 null_deref.
`built-ins/JSON/parse`: 55 / 77 (71.4%) — 19 assertion_fail.

Spec §25.5.2 (JSON.stringify) requires:
1. **`replacer`** can be a function (called for every key, with `(key, value)`) or an Array
   (used as a property allow-list for objects).
2. **`toJSON`** method on a value: if present, called via `Get(value, "toJSON")` and the result
   replaces the value (Date, BigInt, Temporal use this).
3. **`SerializeJSONProperty`** algorithm: nested objects, arrays, escaping, NaN/Infinity → null.
4. **Cycle detection** must throw TypeError.
5. **Indent** can be a Number or String, capped at 10 spaces.

Current `__json_stringify` host-imports JS `JSON.stringify` directly, which should be spec-compliant.
The 42 assertion_fail errors strongly suggest:
- We're calling `JSON.stringify(value, replacer, space)` but the replacer is a Wasm closure that
  the host JS engine cannot invoke (no JS-to-Wasm bridge for the replacer callback).
- Or: the Wasm callbacks are wrapped in a way that loses the `this` (the holder object) per spec
  §25.5.2.2.

Pure-Wasm JSON is tracked by #1324; this issue is the host-mode fidelity problem.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `built-ins/JSON/stringify/replacer-function-arguments.js` passes.
2. `built-ins/JSON/stringify/value-tojson-{primitive,object}.js` passes.
3. `built-ins/JSON/stringify/replacer-array-{normal,non-normal}.js` passes.
4. Pass-rate for `built-ins/JSON/stringify` rises from 26% to ≥75%.

## Files to modify

- `src/runtime.ts` — `__json_stringify`, `__json_parse` callback bridge
- `src/codegen/registry/json.ts` (or equivalent registration)

## Implementation Plan

### Root cause

Replacer is a function, but when crossing into host JSON.stringify the host expects to call
the replacer as a JavaScript function with `this` set to the holder. Our Wasm function refs
are not directly JS-callable (issue #1308) — they need an externref-callable trampoline.

### Approach

1. Wrap Wasm-replacer functions in a JS closure at boundary: `function (k, v) { return wasmFn(this, k, v); }`.
2. For Array replacers (property-list mode): pass the array directly to host; spec says only
   strings and numbers are honored.
3. For the `toJSON` lookup: JSON.stringify host code does `Get(value, "toJSON")` — works automatically
   for externref objects with toJSON; for typed structs we may need to inline the lookup before
   handing the value to the host (since host can't see Wasm struct fields).

### Edge cases

- Replacer returns undefined for an array element → element becomes null per spec.
- toJSON is not a Function → ignored (no error).
- Property-list replacer with duplicate names → use first occurrence per spec.
- Object with cyclic reference → TypeError.

### Test262 sample

- `test262/test/built-ins/JSON/stringify/replacer-function-arguments.js`
- `test262/test/built-ins/JSON/stringify/value-tojson-object.js`
- `test262/test/built-ins/JSON/stringify/replacer-array-normal.js`

## Implementation Notes (2026-05-08)

### Scope of this PR — replacer-function bridge

`__json_stringify` host import already passes `replacer` through to JS
`JSON.stringify`. When the user wrote `JSON.stringify(obj, fn)` where `fn`
is a TS arrow/function expression, our compiler produced a WasmGC closure
struct that lands at the JS boundary as `typeof === "object"`. JS
`JSON.stringify` only honours replacers where `typeof === "function"`, so
our closure was silently ignored — the assertion_fail tests reflect this.

### Fix

In `src/runtime.ts` JSON_stringify host import: when `replacer` is a
WasmGC closure, wrap it in a JS function bridge that invokes the closure
through the `__call_fn_2(closure, key, value)` export. As a fallback,
attempt to convert WasmGC vec/array replacers into a plain JS array via
`_wasmToPlain` so the property-list filter mode works.

### Out of scope

- `toJSON` method on user-defined classes — currently `_wasmToPlain` does
  not invoke `toJSON` on WasmGC structs before serialisation. Property-list
  filter for arbitrary keys (Symbol-keyed, etc.) requires a fuller
  `_wasmToPlain` extension.
- The `this` binding inside the replacer (spec mandates this = holder
  object) is best-effort: the `__call_fn_2` invocation uses the closure's
  captured environment, not the JS `this`.

## Test Results

- `tests/issue-1342-json.test.ts` — 3/3 pass (function replacer transforms,
  drop via undefined, no-replacer no-regression).
- `tests/equivalence/json-stringify.test.ts`,
  `tests/issue-json-stringify-structs.test.ts` — same pre-existing
  failures as main, no new regressions from the replacer bridge.

## Closed as duplicate (2026-06-12)

Duplicate of #1636 (same slug, json-stringify replacer/toJSON spec gap — renumber artifact). #1636 carries the S1 strict-this regression note and is canonical.
