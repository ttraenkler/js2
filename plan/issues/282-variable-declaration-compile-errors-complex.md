# Issue #282: Variable declaration compile errors -- complex initializers

## Status: done

## Summary
~60 tests fail in language/statements/variable with compile errors. These involve variable declarations with complex initializers (function expressions, class expressions, conditional expressions) or multiple declarations in one statement with type mismatches.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group D

## Complexity: S

## Scope
- Handle variable declarations with class expression initializers
- Support multiple declarations with different inferred types
- Handle variable declarations in for-loop heads with complex patterns
- Update variable declaration compilation in `src/codegen/statements.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Variable declarations with complex initializers compile
- Multiple declarations with different types compile
- At least 20 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Notes

### Root cause
The `collectStringLiterals`, `collectStringMethodImports`, `collectForInStringLiterals`,
`collectInExprStringLiterals`, and `collectStringStaticImports` functions in `src/codegen/index.ts`
only scanned function declaration bodies for string literals and string method calls. Module-level
variable initializers, class declarations, and expression statements were not scanned. This caused
string literals that appeared only in module-level variable initializers to not be registered as
string constant imports, resulting in "String literal not registered" codegen errors.

### Changes
- **`src/codegen/index.ts`**: Extended all `collect*` scanning functions to also visit
  module-level variable initializers, class declarations, and expression statements.
  Functions updated in this round:
  - `collectObjectMethodStringLiterals` -- was only scanning function declarations
  - `collectPromiseImports` -- was missing variable statements and expression statements
  - `collectJsonImports` -- was missing variable statements and expression statements
  - `collectCallbackImports` -- was only scanning function declarations
  - `collectFunctionalArrayImports` -- was missing class declarations and expression statements
  - `collectUnionImports` -- was only scanning function declarations
  - `collectIteratorImports` -- was missing variable statements and expression statements

  Previously fixed (already on main): `collectStringLiterals`, `collectStringMethodImports`,
  `collectForInStringLiterals`, `collectInExprStringLiterals`, `collectStringStaticImports`.

### Test results
- All 20 tests in `tests/issue-282.test.ts` pass
- All 41 tests across issue-282, json, promise-combinators, iterators, union-narrowing, module-globals pass
- No regressions in equivalence tests (4 pre-existing failures unrelated to this change)
