# #1092 — Wrong error type: 69 tests expect TypeError but get Test262Error

## Problem

69 test262 tests use `assert.throws(TypeError, ...)` but the compiled code
doesn't throw at all — the operation succeeds, the `assert.throws` wrapper
catches no exception, and the test's own `Test262Error("Expected an
exception")` fires instead.

The pattern: "Expected TypeError, got Test262Error: Expected an exception."
This means the TypeError-triggering operation silently succeeds in our
compiled code when it should fail.

## ECMAScript spec reference

- Various built-in operations specify "throw a **TypeError** exception" — e.g., [§7.3.2 Get](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-get-o-p) on non-object, [§7.2.1 RequireObjectCoercible](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-requireobjectcoercible) for null/undefined
- The compiler must emit the correct error type as specified by each algorithm step


## Root cause

The compiled code is missing runtime type checks that the spec requires to
throw TypeError. Common patterns:

1. **Calling a non-callable value** — `null()`, `undefined()`, `({})()`
   should throw TypeError but our code may emit a no-op or return undefined
2. **`this` type validation in built-in methods** — e.g.
   `Array.prototype.push.call(null)` should throw TypeError because `this`
   is not an object; our host bridge may not validate `this`
3. **Property access on frozen/sealed objects** — `Object.freeze(obj);
   obj.x = 1` should throw TypeError in strict mode; our codegen may skip
   the freeze check
4. **Constructor invocation checks** — calling `Symbol()` with `new` should
   throw TypeError; our codegen may not distinguish `new`-callable from
   call-callable

## Affected tests

69 tests across:
- `built-ins/Array/prototype/` (this-type validation)
- `built-ins/Object/` (frozen/sealed violations)
- `built-ins/Symbol/` (new-callable check)
- `language/expressions/call/` (non-callable invocation)

Example files:
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/push/call-with-null-this.js`
- `test/built-ins/Object/freeze/throws-on-define.js`
- `test/built-ins/Symbol/new-target-throws.js`
- `test/language/expressions/call/non-callable-object.js`
- `test/built-ins/TypedArray/prototype/set/this-not-typedarray.js`

## Proposed solution

1. Cluster the 69 tests by which TypeError-triggering operation they test
2. For each cluster:
   - **Non-callable invocation**: add a runtime `typeof fn !== "function"`
     check before `call_ref` or `__extern_call` — emit TypeError if not
     callable
   - **this-type validation**: add `__validate_this_type(this, expectedType)`
     host helper that built-in method wrappers call before dispatching
   - **Frozen/sealed object writes**: check `Object.isFrozen`/`isSealed`
     in the `__extern_set` host path before writing
   - **Constructor checks**: distinguish `[[Construct]]` from `[[Call]]`
     in the codegen for `new` expressions
3. Each cluster is independently shippable as a narrow PR

## Effort estimate

**M** — each TypeError cluster is a narrow check (5-20 LOC). The total is
~4-6 distinct check patterns across runtime.ts + codegen call/new paths.
The risk is that adding checks in hot paths (property set, function call)
could introduce performance regressions — measure before/after on the
landing-page benchmarks.
