# #439 -- Generator type missing next/return/throw methods (16 CE)

## Problem

16+ tests fail because the generated generator object type does not include the required iterator protocol methods (next, return, throw). When code calls `.next()` on a generator result, the compiler cannot resolve the method.

Additionally, TypeScript diagnostic code 2739 ("Type 'X' is missing the following properties from type 'Generator': next, return, throw") was not being downgraded to a warning, causing compilation to be reported as failed even though the codegen could handle it.

Example:
```javascript
function* gen() { yield 1; yield 2; }
const it = gen();
it.next();    // was: only method handled
it.return(0); // was: no codegen support
```

## Root cause

1. TS diagnostic code 2739 was not in `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES`, so the type mismatch error blocked compilation
2. Only `.next()` was compiled for generator types; `.return()` and `.throw()` had no codegen path
3. The `__gen_return` and `__gen_throw` host imports were not registered

## Depends on
- #412 (yield outside generator) -- generator function compilation must work first

## Priority: medium (16 tests)

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Generator objects have next(), return(), and throw() methods
- [x] TS diagnostic 2739 downgraded to warning (not blocking compilation)
- [x] CE count for this pattern reduced to near zero
