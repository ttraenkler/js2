## Problem

`tests/async-census.test.ts` does not fail an assertion — it fails to **collect**,
so all of its tests are lost:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'MAP')
 ❯ src/codegen/collections-brand.ts:100:24
    99| const KIND_OF: Record<CollectionClass, number> = {
   100|   Map: COLLECTION_KIND.MAP,
 ❯ src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts:36:1
```

`KIND_OF` is a module-level constant that reads `COLLECTION_KIND` while the
declaring module has not finished initializing — a circular-import ordering bug,
the same family as
[#3324](https://js2wasm.loopdive.com/dashboard/issue.html?slug=3324-boolToStringEmitter-module-init-cycle)
(`Cannot access 'boolToStringEmitter' before initialization`), which was fixed
for a different entry point.

The trigger is the entry point: `tests/async-census.test.ts` imports
`../src/codegen/async-cps.js` **directly**, without first importing
`../src/index.js`. Several sibling tests carry an explicit comment saying to
"import the top compiler entry first so the codegen module graph initializes in
the correct order" (e.g. `tests/issue-2906-async-multiawait.test.ts`) — that
workaround is load-bearing and undocumented outside those comments, which is the
real defect: any new test that imports a codegen module directly hits this.

## Reproduce

On a clean checkout of `upstream/main`:

```bash
node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/async-census.test.ts
# Test Files  1 failed (1) — Tests  no tests
```

Verified on `e8a778638f` (2026-09-12) and again on `7adc0a6e89` (2026-09-13),
both with and without an unrelated `src/codegen/async-frame.ts` edit in the tree.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/async-census.test.ts` collects
   and passes with no other file loaded first.
2. The fix is in the module graph (e.g. make `KIND_OF` lazy, or break the
   `calls.ts` → `collections-brand.ts` → … cycle), **not** an added
   `import "../src/index.js"` line in the test — that only moves the trap to the
   next test that forgets it.
3. A note in the relevant module explaining which edge of the cycle is load-bearing.

## Resolution

**Already fixed on `main` before this file landed** — by
[#6419](https://js2wasm.loopdive.com/dashboard/issue.html?slug=6419-three-closure-area-tests-red-on-main)
(`53ba0b7b46`, merged as PR #5876 on 2026-09-13), which extracted
`COLLECTION_KIND` into its own module `src/codegen/collection-kind.ts` and so cut
the edge of the cycle this issue describes.

Timeline: reproduced at `e8a778638f` and `7adc0a6e89` (both `Test Files 1 failed`,
`Tests no tests`); at `f1462c4d15` the same command gives
`Test Files 1 passed — Tests 13 passed`. No further work is needed; the file is
kept so the reserved id is not a hole in the sequence and so the failure mode
(`KIND_OF` reading a not-yet-initialized module constant, reachable from any test
that imports a codegen module without `src/index.js` first) stays searchable.

Acceptance criterion 2 is satisfied by construction — the fix was in the module
graph, not an added import in the test. Criterion 3 (a note naming the
load-bearing edge) was **not** done and remains open as a small follow-up on
`collection-kind.ts` if anyone wants it.
