# #1003 -- Normalize issue metadata: add ES edition, language feature, and task type to all issue frontmatter

## Status: open

Issue frontmatter is still missing structured metadata that would make planning,
dashboarding, and backlog slicing much easier:

- the ES edition or edition family the issue concerns
- the primary language feature / subsystem
- whether the issue is a bug, feature, test, refactor, or planning task

Right now those distinctions mostly live in prose, which makes machine-readable
planning and reporting much weaker than it needs to be.

## Goal

Add canonical metadata fields to every issue so the planning system can answer
questions like:

- which open issues are ES2020-specific?
- which issues concern RegExp vs destructuring vs modules?
- how many sprint items are bugs vs features vs tests vs planning work?

## Required frontmatter additions

Every issue should gain:

- `es_edition: <edition | multi | n/a>`
- `language_feature: <normalized-feature-slug>`
- `task_type: <bug | feature | test | refactor | planning>`

Where useful, `language_feature` may reference a subsystem rather than a
spec-visible feature, e.g. `compiler-pipeline`, `dashboard`, `wasm-emit`,
`planning-metadata`.

## Scope

1. Define the allowed vocabulary and examples
2. Update all issue files under `plan/issues/`
3. Update PO / issue-creation guidance in `.claude`
4. Make the rule part of the team’s remembered process, not just a one-off edit
5. Ensure future issue creation includes these fields by default

## Acceptance criteria

- every issue file has `es_edition`, `language_feature`, and `task_type`
- `.claude/agents/product-owner.md` requires these fields
- the issue-creation definition in `.claude` requires these fields
- a team memory note exists so the rule is not forgotten in future sessions
