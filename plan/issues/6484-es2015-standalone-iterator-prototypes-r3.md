# 2026-09-16 (#6484 S1+S2): the slice adds a `family` field to `$__IterRec` and
# the two routes that make the intrinsic iterator prototypes reachable. Each
# grant below is where the mechanism has to live, not where it was convenient:
#   - iterator-native.ts owns `$__IterRec`, so the field, the `ITER_FAMILY_*`
#     enum and the per-arm family operand are all in-module. The exhausted-
#     cursor latch (§23.1.5.1 step 6.a) is in the same step body.
#   - array-object-proto.ts owns `emitIteratorPrototypeSingleton`; the new
#     %IteratorPrototype% root and the %ArrayIteratorPrototype% `next` property
#     are two more arms of that one factory, and the ArrayIterator glue sits
#     next to its Map/Set twins.
#   - call-builtin-static.ts / property-access.ts / call-tail-dispatch.ts /
#     index.ts / map-runtime.ts each take ONE call-site arm; the shared
#     mechanism itself is a NEW module, src/codegen/iterator-proto-next.ts.
# 2026-09-16 (review follow-up): iter-hof-native.ts owns `__iter_hof_open`, the
# positive-admission classifier for the eager Iterator helpers. The S2 carrier
# migration made `arr[Symbol.iterator]()` a `$__IterRec`, which that classifier
# did not admit, so `iter.reduce(cb, init)` silently stopped calling `cb`. The
# one-arm pass-through has to live beside the three arms it copies.
# 2026-09-16 (#6484 S3, merged into this branch): the TypedArray `@@iterator`
# fix adds the packed-carrier arms in iterator-native.ts and one dispatch arm
# each in call-tail-dispatch.ts, closed-method-dispatch.ts and index.ts; the
# iterator-family field it reads lives on the context type.

# ES2015 standalone: iterator prototypes are unreachable from a dynamically-typed iterator

`Object.getPrototypeOf(<iterator>)` answers a genuine `%XIteratorPrototype%`
singleton **only when the TypeScript checker proves the argument's static type**
(`ArrayIterator<T>`, `MapIterator`, `SetIterator`, `StringIterator`). Every
test262 program is plain JavaScript, so every value there is `any` and the
static key never fires: the four arms in
`src/codegen/expressions/call-builtin-static.ts` are skipped and the generic
fallback answers `ref.null.extern`.

That one fact is behind 20+ ES2015 standalone rows, plus the `%IteratorPrototype%`
family that hangs off those singletons.

## Measured (2026-09-16, `--target standalone`, probes in `.tmp/iter/`)

| probe | result |
| --- | --- |
| `const it: any = [1,2,3][Symbol.iterator]()` | the iterator itself is an object, and `it.next()` steps correctly (`value=1`) |
| `Object.getPrototypeOf(it)` | **null** — `protoIsObject=0` |
| `typeof it.next` | **not `"function"`** — `itHasNext=0`; `next` is callable only through the static call site, never readable as a property value |
| `Object.getPrototypeOf(new Map([[1,2]])[Symbol.iterator]())` | **null** — so `%MapIteratorPrototype%.next` is unreachable |
| `Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf([1][Symbol.iterator]()))` (`%IteratorPrototype%`) | **null**; no `[Symbol.iterator]` |
| `new Int8Array([1,2])[Symbol.iterator]()` | **traps** — `[object WebAssembly.Exception]` (a separate defect, S3) |

Baseline: `.test262-cache/test262-standalone-current.jsonl` fetched 2026-09-16
10:46 UTC; ES2015 census `10,303 / 11,704 = 88.0 %`, 1,401 non-pass.

## Why the singletons exist but never answer

`emitIteratorPrototypeSingleton` (`src/codegen/array-object-proto.ts:3964`)
already materialises an identity-stable `$Object` per family, with
`@@toStringTag` and — for Map/Set/String — an own `next` data property
(#3013, #4747, #4777, #5099, #5267 R3-2). The gap is purely the **routing**:
`call-builtin-static.ts:2405-2452` keys each arm on
`ctx.checker.getTypeAtLocation(arg0).getSymbol()?.name`. The iterator record
itself (`$__IterRec`, `iterator-native.ts:421`) carries a `kind` tag that
discriminates the *carrier* (VEC / USER / OBJ / HOSTGEN / ASYNCGEN / GENSTATE),
**not** the iterator family, so no runtime arm can tell an array iterator from a
map iterator today.

## Implementation Plan

Three slices. S1 and S2 share the family tag and should land together; S3 is an
independent defect and may land separately.

### S1 — a family tag on `$__IterRec`, and a dynamic `getPrototypeOf` arm

1. **Add a fifth field to `$__IterRec`** in `getOrRegisterIterRecType`
   (`src/codegen/iterator-native.ts:421`):
   `{ name: "family", type: { kind: "i32" }, mutable: false }`.
   Field order 0..3 is load-bearing and documented — **append, never reorder**.
   Introduce an exported enum next to the existing `ITER_KIND_*` constants:
   `ITER_FAMILY_UNKNOWN = 0`, `ARRAY = 1`, `MAP = 2`, `SET = 3`, `STRING = 4`.
   A TypedArray iterator is an **Array** iterator per §23.2.3.30
   (`CreateArrayIterator`), so it takes family 1 — do not mint a fifth family.
2. **Every `struct.new` of the record must push the new operand.** Grep for the
   IterRec type index at every construction site (`iterator-native.ts`,
   `array-methods.ts:3157` `compileNativeArrayIterator`, and any site reached
   through `getOrRegisterIterRecType`); a missed site is a validation error, not
   a silent wrong answer, so the compiler will find them — but audit them all in
   one pass rather than fixing them as they fail. Producers stamp the family they
   statically know: the array-iterator builders stamp `ARRAY`, the collection
   builders `MAP`/`SET`, the string-iterator builder `STRING`, and every generic
   / user / host-generator carrier stamps `UNKNOWN`.
3. **A runtime prototype resolver.** Add `ensureIterRecPrototypeHelper(ctx)` —
   a defined function `__iter_rec_proto(externref) -> externref` whose body is a
   switch on the `family` field, each arm emitting the existing
   `emitIteratorPrototypeSingleton(ctx, helperFctx, kind)` sequence (it pushes
   into whatever `FunctionContext` it is handed, so a synthesized one works).
   `UNKNOWN`, and a non-record argument, answer `ref.null.extern` — the
   historical result, so nothing that passes today can regress.
4. **Route it.** In `call-builtin-static.ts`, after the four static arms and
   before the generic fallback, add a standalone/wasi arm: compile the argument,
   `any.convert_extern` + `ref.test $__IterRec`, and on a hit call
   `__iter_rec_proto`. Keep the static arms — they are cheaper and already
   pinned. Evaluation order must stay observable: compile the argument exactly
   once, into a local.
5. **`%ArrayIteratorPrototype%` needs its own `next`.** Map/Set/String already
   install a descriptor-carrying native method closure in
   `emitIteratorPrototypeSingleton`; Array does not. Add the Array arm the same
   way (`name: "next"`, `length: 0`, `writable: true, enumerable: false,
   configurable: true`).
6. **`%IteratorPrototype%`.** Mint a fifth singleton global
   (`__native_iterator_prototype`) with an own `[Symbol.iterator]` data property
   whose value is a native closure returning its `this` (§27.1.2.1), and set it
   as the `[[Prototype]]` of all four family singletons through the same
   object-runtime call the rest of the file uses for a prototype link. Its
   `@@iterator` closure must have `name: "[Symbol.iterator]"` and `length: 0`.

**S1 acceptance** (`scripts/run-test262-paths.mts --isolate --standalone`):
`built-ins/ArrayIteratorPrototype/next/{length,name,property-descriptor}.js`,
`built-ins/Iterator/prototype/Symbol.iterator/{is-function,length,name,prop-desc,return-val}.js`
— 8 rows fail → pass, with no loss anywhere in
`built-ins/{Array,Map,Set,String,TypedArray}`, `language/statements/for-of`,
`language/expressions/spread` (run those as the control set).

### S2 — `it.next` as a readable property, and the receiver brand check

`iterator.next.call(false)` is the shape of all ten Map/Set rows. Two things are
missing: reading `next` off a `$__IterRec` value at all, and the closure's
§23.1.5.2 step-2 receiver check.

1. **An `$__IterRec` arm in the object runtime's property read** (`__extern_get`,
   `src/codegen/object-runtime.ts`): on a record receiver, resolve the key
   through `__iter_rec_proto(receiver)` — i.e. the record has no own properties,
   so every read is a prototype read. This keeps one source of truth for the
   prototype and automatically picks up S1's `next`.
2. **Brand-check the `next` closure.** The native method closure installed on
   each family prototype must, when invoked with a receiver that is not a
   `$__IterRec` of the matching family, throw a **catchable** `TypeError`
   (never a `ref.cast` trap) — the same discipline as
   `recoverRegExpStructFromExternref` (`regexp-standalone.ts:3107`) and #2100 M2.
   A primitive receiver (`false`, `1`, `''`, `undefined`, `null`) and a plain
   object must both throw.
3. Calling `next` **through** the prototype on a genuine record must still step
   the record (`ArrayIteratorPrototype/next/iteration.js`), so the closure's
   happy path routes into the existing `__iterator_next`.

**S2 acceptance**: `built-ins/MapIteratorPrototype/next/*.js` (5),
`built-ins/SetIteratorPrototype/next/*.js` (5),
`built-ins/ArrayIteratorPrototype/next/{iteration,iteration-mutable}.js` (2)
— 12 rows fail → pass. Same control set as S1, plus
`built-ins/Map/prototype/{keys,values,entries}` and the `Set` twins.

### S3 — `new Int8Array([…])[Symbol.iterator]()` traps

Independent of S1/S2 and diagnosed only as far as the trap. Root-cause it before
changing anything: compile
`const ta: any = new Int8Array([1,2]); const it: any = ta[Symbol.iterator]();`
with `emitWat: true` and find which cast traps. The likely shape is that the
array-iterator builder's receiver discovery
(`compileNativeArrayIterator`, `array-methods.ts:3151`) expects a canonical
externref `$Vec` and a packed TypedArray carrier is not one — the same
representation-identity hazard #5349 hit. Fix at the receiver-normalisation
step, not by widening a cast.

**S3 acceptance**: the nine
`built-ins/ArrayIteratorPrototype/next/{Int8,Uint8,Uint8Clamped,Int16,Uint16,Int32,Uint32,Float32,Float64}Array.js`
rows fail → pass; control set
`built-ins/TypedArray/prototype/{values,keys,entries,Symbol.iterator}` plus the
whole `built-ins/TypedArrayConstructors` tree, 0 lost.

## Order-preservation and hazards

- **Never reorder `$__IterRec` fields 0..3.** Several bodies index them
  positionally.
- **The four static arms stay.** Removing them in favour of the dynamic one
  would change the answer for a statically-typed iterator from a constant-folded
  global read to a runtime call, and the #3013 identity pins would still pass —
  a silent cost regression with no test to catch it.
- **A `ref.cast` that never trapped is load-bearing.** Adding a field to a
  struct changes its canonical type; grep every `ref.test`/`ref.cast` against
  the IterRec type index before and after (#5349 round 3's lesson).
- **Host output must not move.** The whole lane is `ctx.standalone || ctx.wasi`.
  Prove it: compile a representative corpus on the JS-host target before and
  after and compare sha256 per module.
- **Execute each new site twice** (a loop, or two calls on different arms): a
  helper that caches a singleton in a global must initialise its result local on
  every execution, not only on the first (#5349 round 4 → 5).

## Validation required before the PR

- TS7 typecheck, lint, prettier.
- The five source-ratchet gates, bare **and** with `LOC_GATE_BASE=origin/main`;
  growth allowances go in this file's frontmatter with a dated rationale, never
  in `scripts/*-baseline.json`.
- `npm test -- tests/equivalence.test.ts` (all shards).
- A new pin file `tests/issue-6484-iterator-prototypes.test.ts` asserting, on
  standalone with `result.imports` `[]`: the prototype identity across all four
  array-iterator producers, cross-family distinctness (Array ≠ Map ≠ Set ≠
  String — two nulls compare equal, so a broken build must not read as green),
  `%IteratorPrototype%` as the shared parent, `next.length === 0` /
  `next.name === "next"`, and the TypeError on a primitive receiver.
- Row runs for the acceptance and control sets above, each against a base tree
  built from the merge-base sha (`git archive` + `pnpm run -s build:compiler-bundle`),
  reporting pass counts for base and branch side by side.

## Adversarial review of S1+S2 (2026-09-16) — what was wrong and what is left

Three findings. Two were ONE defect; the third was a false claim in a comment.

### 1 + 2. The run-time route was order-dependent (fixed)

`ensureIterRecPrototypeHelper` declined whenever `$__IterRec` was not registered
yet, and `emitBuiltinGetPrototypeOfFallback` deliberately calls it **before** it
compiles its argument (the #2043 index-shift discipline). So the module's FIRST
`Object.getPrototypeOf(<iterator>)` answered the historical `null`, while the
identical expression one statement later answered a real prototype:

```
.tmp/adv/p14.ts (first statement)  firstTouch=0     <- the #6484 defect, unfixed
.tmp/adv/p15.ts (one warm-up line) afterWarmup=1
```

Every pin in the first cut built its iterators in earlier statements, so all
seven were immune by construction. Test262 programs use the cold shape.

Finding 2 — `Object.getPrototypeOf(this.<field>)` inside a class METHOD
answering `null` while every other access shape answered the real prototype —
is the SAME defect reached by a different compile order: methods are compiled
before the top-level body, so the read inside the method was the module's first
occurrence. It needed no separate fix and is closed by the same change.

Fix: `ensureIterRecPrototypeHelper` now calls `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime(ctx)`
and re-reads `structMap`, exactly as its sibling `resolveIteratorFamilyNextClosure`
has always done. A module that asks either question has an iterator either way.
After the fix, cold-first: `firstTouch=1`, `mapFirst=1`, `protoNotNull=1`,
`fromInsideMethod=1`, and a cold module also gets `typeof it.next === "function"`,
cross-family distinctness and the shared `%IteratorPrototype%` root.

Two new pins (`tests/issue-6484-iterator-prototypes.test.ts`) put the
`getPrototypeOf` call FIRST, one at top level and one inside a class method.
Both fail on the pre-fix helper and pass after — verified by an A/B file-copy
revert, not by assumption.

### 3. Growth during iteration — the comment was wrong, the behaviour is #3100's

The #6484 latch comment claimed the length is re-read every step, full stop.
Measured 2026-09-16 (standalone, `push` after the first step; V8 yields 3 for
all three):

| receiver | steps |
| --- | --- |
| `["a","b"]` (externref elements) | 3 — live |
| `[{v:1},{v:2}]` (externref elements) | 3 — live |
| `[1,2]` (f64 elements) | **2 — snapshot** |

So the step body genuinely has no cached bound, and growth IS observed whenever
the record's `vec` is the subject's own storage. The reviewer's proposed
mechanism — "`push` reallocates and the immutable `vec` field hides it" — is
not what happens: `push` mutates the carrier in place and an alias of the array
reads `length === 3` (`.tmp/fix/alias.ts`: `bLen=3 aliasIdentity=1`). The real
cause is the **#3100 vec-family normalization arm** (`buildVecFamilyArms`),
which boxes a non-externref carrier into a FRESH `$__arr_externref` and cursors
over that copy. It predates this slice and applies to every dynamic
`GetIterator` on a numeric array.

The comment has been corrected to say exactly this. The behaviour is NOT fixed
here: making it live means re-deriving the per-carrier boxing at every step,
which reopens #3100's carrier-normalization tradeoff and touches the hottest
iteration path in the compiler. A pin locks the half that IS correct (the
externref carrier growing live, plus the exhaustion latch); the numeric-carrier
answer is deliberately left unpinned so a later fix does not have to fight a
test that locks in the wrong number.

**Residual (open, pre-existing, no test262 row):** a dynamic iterator over a
numeric array is a snapshot — mid-iteration `push` and `pop` are invisible
(`pushBeforeFirstNext` 12 vs 123, `shrinkMid` 123 vs 1). S1+S2 make this
reachable for a statically-typed receiver, which used to throw instead. The
test262 row that would catch it, `ArrayIteratorPrototype/next/iteration-mutable.js`,
grows from an EMPTY array, and that shape works (empty ⇒ no copy).

### 4. A control row the review did not report: the carrier migration silently broke `iter.reduce`

Found by running the full 641-row control set against a base tree built from
`66405a1244` (the merge base), not by the review. `built-ins/Iterator/prototype/
reduce/reducer-memo-can-be-any-type.js` PASSED on base and FAILED on S1+S2 —
and it fails on the S1+S2 commit alone, so it is the slice's, not the
order-dependence fix's.

Mechanism: `__iter_hof_open` (`src/codegen/iter-hof-native.ts`) is a
positive-admission classifier — it passes through the handles it knows
(`$LazyIterHelper`, a driven generator frame, a next-callable) and hands
everything else to the `__iterator` ladder only for the carriers that ladder can
take, with a NULL SENTINEL for the rest. S2 migrated `arr[Symbol.iterator]()`
from a snapshot `$Vec` (admitted) to a live `$__IterRec` (admitted by nothing),
so `iter.reduce(cb, init)` hit the sentinel and returned `undefined` **without
calling `cb` once** — measured on a 3-element probe: `calls=3` on base,
`calls=0` after the migration. Nothing threw; the failure was silent.

Fix: one pass-through arm — a `$__IterRec` IS the handle, exactly like the three
arms next to it, and `__iter_hof_next` / `__iter_hof_close` already delegate to
`__iterator_next` / `__iterator_return`, which take that record. It is also
closer to §27.1.4 than what it restores: stepping the record consumes the
iterator, where the snapshot-vec route read a frozen copy and left the cursor
untouched.

Pinned in `tests/issue-6484-iterator-prototypes.test.ts`
("an iterator VALUE still drives the eager helper loop").

**Process note:** the review's seven pin tests and the S1+S2 control evidence
were both narrower than the change. This row was only visible from a control set
that included `built-ins/Iterator/prototype/**` and a base measured on this
machine — the kind of run CLAUDE.md asks for and the kind this slice had skipped.

## S3 review round 2 — record (2026-09-16)

Two findings from the second adversarial review. Both reproduced on this tree
with the reviewer's own probes before being touched, both closed here.

### 1. REGRESSION (closed) — `Object.prototype.toString` on the diverted iterator went value → throw

`Object.prototype.toString.call(<any-typed TypedArray iterator>)` answered the
string `"[object Array]"` on base (length 14) and **threw** a catchable TypeError
on the S3 commit and after the round-1 fix. Reproduced exactly as reported:

| tree | `tag` | `tagOnly` | `stepsStillOk` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| base `66405a1244` | 2 (`[object Array]`) | 14 | THREW |
| S3 `7eb5f8eb95` | 8 (catch arm) | THREW | 1 |
| round-1 `7088bf90b4` | 8 (catch arm) | THREW | 1 |
| **here** | **1 (`[object Array Iterator]`)** | **23** | **1** |

Cause: swapping the snapshot `$Vec` for a `$__IterRec` removed the receiver from
every arm of the §20.1.3.6 classifier — the classifier has a `$__vec_base` arm
but none for the record — so control reached the refusal tail. The round-1
`%ArrayIteratorPrototype%` arm did not help: it teaches `__getPrototypeOf` about
the record, and `Object.prototype.toString` does not consult it.

Fix: `fillIterRecObjectProtoToStringArm` (object-proto-tostring-native.ts), a
finalize splice giving a kind-VEC `$__IterRec` the tag `[object Array Iterator]`.

- **Why that tag and not base's `[object Array]`.** §23.2.3.36 makes
  `%TypedArray%.prototype[@@iterator]` be `.values`, i.e. `CreateArrayIterator`,
  so the object IS an Array Iterator and §20.1.3.6 step 15 reads `"Array
  Iterator"` off `%ArrayIteratorPrototype%`. Base's answer was the snapshot vec
  answering for itself — a value, but the wrong one. It also keeps the branch
  self-consistent: the round-1 arm already reports `%ArrayIteratorPrototype%` as
  this exact object's `[[Prototype]]`, and a tag of `"Array"` would contradict
  the prototype the same module hands out.
- **THREE consumers carry the classifier chain, not two.** The one that actually
  answers `Object.prototype.toString.call(v)` for an `any` `v` — the whole
  test262 surface — is `__object_proto_to_string_runtime`. Measured: in a module
  that only uses that spelling, `__opts_classify` and the reflective closure are
  **absent**, so the first cut of this fix (which patched only those two) had
  `consumers=0` and changed nothing observable. Named in the function's doc so
  the next person does not repeat it.
- **A durable flag was required.** `typedArrayIterRecProtoPending` is a one-shot
  cleared by `prependIterRecPrototypeArm`, which runs EARLIER in both finalize
  sequences, so it always reads false by the time the class-tag step runs.
  `typedArrayIterRecDiverted` is set once at the divert site and never cleared.

Scoping, proven not asserted — a 9-module sha256 corpus, `--target standalone`:
**exactly one module's bytes move base → here** (`c9-ta-iter.ts`, the
typed-array-iterator module). Plain-array iteration, string iteration, Map/Set,
ArrayBuffer/DataView, a non-iterating TypedArray, generators, class prototypes
and a plain `Object.prototype.toString` module are all byte-identical. Round-1 →
here is byte-identical on all nine, including `c9`: the arm costs bytes only in a
module that BOTH diverts a typed-array `@@iterator` AND calls
`Object.prototype.toString`.

Neighbour controls, unchanged from base (`p10-tostring-matrix`): plain-array
iterator `[object Array]`, plain object `[object Object]`, plain array
`[object Array]`, Map/Set iterator still REFUSE (they are `ITER_KIND_MAPSET`,
outside the arm).

**RESIDUAL, inherited from round 1 and verified here, not newly introduced.** A
string iterator is also a kind-VEC record, so in a module that iterates BOTH a
typed array and a string an `any`-typed string iterator now reports
`[object Array Iterator]` where base refused. This is the same missing `family`
field as round 1's prototype residual, which was measured independently rather
than taken on trust: `strIterProto` is `null` on base and
`%ArrayIteratorPrototype%` on round-1 AND here. S1's `family` field deletes both
arms at once. Not papered over with a different tag, because two arms disagreeing
about one record would be worse than one shared, documented gap.

Row impact: none. No test under
`built-ins/TypedArray/prototype/{Symbol.iterator,values,keys,entries}` asks for
the iterator's class tag (`grep -rln "Object.prototype.toString"` over those four
directories returns nothing), which is exactly why the row sets could not have
caught this and a probe had to.

### 2. VACUOUS PIN (closed) — the Map/Set distinctness test asserted nothing

Confirmed: `Object.getPrototypeOf(m.keys())` bound to an `any` local is `null` on
base AND on branch, so the old test's `pm !== aip` / `ps !== aip` were
`null !== <singleton>` — true whatever the arm does. The test could not have
caught the collapse it advertised, and its comment (and the round-1 commit
message) claimed Map/Set "keep their own singletons" when they keep `null`. That
claim is withdrawn.

Fixing it needed the module SHAPE, not a weaker assertion. The shape decides
which mechanism answers:

- **Shape A** — Map/Set queried only through an `any` local. The iterator stays a
  `$__IterRec`, so `__getPrototypeOf` and the new arm are what answer, and the
  answer is `null`. Pinning it AT `null` is what catches a collapse.
- **Shape B** — the same query with the static type visible. `m.keys()` has
  static type `MapIterator`, which fires the #3013 **compile-time** arm and
  reaches the real singleton, so every comparison is object-vs-object.

The `any` **local** is load-bearing: passing `m.keys()` straight into
`Object.getPrototypeOf` keeps its static type and never reaches the runtime arm.
That is the issue's own core defect, and it is why the first round-2 attempt —
one module carrying both spellings — still passed with the narrowing defeated.

Both shapes are now asserted, and the guard was verified to FAIL when it should:
forcing the arm's `kind == ITER_KIND_VEC` test to constant 1 (so every record
collapses onto `%ArrayIteratorPrototype%`) drives shape A's `dynIsNull` from
`3` to `0` and the test red. Restored afterwards; `tests/issue-6484-s3-typedarray-iterator.test.ts`
is 27/27 green on the real compiler.

### Note on the round-1 wasi coverage

While A/B-ing, a partial `src/` restore (leaving `closed-method-dispatch.ts` at
base) made the `--target wasi` pin fail and briefly looked like a new regression.
It was the restore, not the code: with the tree fully restored, the wasi test
passes. Recorded because the same partial-restore mistake is easy to repeat — a
file-copy A/B must restore EVERY file the branch touches, not only the ones the
current edit touches.

## Merge-repair round — record (2026-09-17)

Four pins were red on the integration branch after S1+S2 and S3 were merged
(`4ee3bf8ceb`, `480910ed5e`, `e44b83cd61`). They split two–two, and the split was
established with probes rather than assumed.

### The split

| # | pin | verdict | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | plain-array receiver keeps the snapshot-vec carrier | **obsolete by design** | `[3,1,2][@@iterator]().next()` → `{value:3,done:false}`; the pin's own text said this expectation FLIPS when a slice gives the plain array a real cursor. S1+S2 is that slice. |
| 2 | Map/Set iterator prototypes do NOT collapse onto `%ArrayIteratorPrototype%` | **obsolete by design** | the pin asserted BOTH are `null`; they are now four real, pairwise-distinct singletons (bitmask `1023`, all ten bits). The pin's own text said this line SHOULD fail once S1 lands. |
| 3 | `Object.prototype.toString` on the diverted iterator returns a value | **REAL regression** | value → throw, reproduced below |
| 4 | the class-tag arm does not disturb neighbouring receivers | **REAL regression** (same defect) + two obsolete control lines | same trap, reached through the PLAIN-array receiver |

### Root cause of the real regression

**S3's round-2 source fix was never committed.** `ccde587fcd` ("snapshot … before
the container restart", *"not yet re-validated"*) committed the round-2 record
and its pins but **no `src/` change** — `git log --all -S` for both
`fillIterRecObjectProtoToStringArm` and `typedArrayIterRecDiverted` returns that
one commit, and its diff touches only the issue file and the test file. The
names existed in prose and in assertions, never in the compiler. So this is not
a mechanism the merge broke; it is a mechanism that was lost, whose pins
survived.

S1+S2 then **widened the blast radius**. The §20.1.3.6 classifier recognises a
snapshot vec (`ref.test $__vec_base` → `[object Array]`) but has no arm for
`$__IterRec`, so the general carrier migration removed the PLAIN array's
iterator from the classifier too and it reached the refusal tail. Measured
standalone, `Object.prototype.toString.call(<any-typed iterator>)`:

| receiver | base `66405a1244` | merged branch | here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `new Int8Array([1,2])[@@iterator]()` | `[object Array]` (14) | **THREW** | `[object Array Iterator]` (23) |
| `[1,2,3][@@iterator]()` | `[object Array]` (14) | **THREW** | `[object Array Iterator]` (23) |
| `"ab"[@@iterator]()` | THREW | THREW | `[object String Iterator]` (24) |
| `m.keys()` | THREW | THREW | `[object Map Iterator]` (21) |
| plain object / plain array | `[object Object]` / `[object Array]` | unchanged | unchanged |

Rows 1–2 are the regression. Rows 3–4 were already refusing on base and close
here for free, off the same field.

### The fix

`fillIterRecObjectProtoToStringArms` (`object-proto-tostring-native.ts`), a
finalize splice giving a `$__IterRec` receiver its class tag from **S1's
`family` field**. Three properties the lost round-2 design did not have:

- **`family`, not `kind`.** `ITER_KIND_*` names the CARRIER — an array iterator
  and a string iterator are both `ITER_KIND_VEC` — so S3's kind-VEC arm would
  have had to report `Array Iterator` for a string iterator. That was the
  documented round-1/round-2 residual, and S1's field deletes it rather than
  inheriting it. `ITER_FAMILY_UNKNOWN` emits no arm and DECLINES, so a record no
  site stamped (generator frame, user iterator) keeps today's answer and nothing
  that passes can start refusing.
- **No durable flag.** The lost design needed `typedArrayIterRecDiverted`
  because it was armed from the divert site. Reading the record's own field
  needs no module-level state at all.
- **FINALIZE, not inline.** `$__IterRec` is registered lazily at the first
  iteration site, which may compile AFTER the classifier body is baked —
  measured: in a module whose `Object.prototype.toString` site precedes its
  iteration, `ctx.structMap.get("__IterRec")` is `undefined` at classifier-emit
  time and an inline arm silently emits nothing (`late` THREW → 23 after the
  splice). Same hazard as the `reserveArgumentsLengthBrand` note in the
  classifier.

The round-2 record's **three-consumer** warning is preserved and was load-bearing:
the consumer that answers `Object.prototype.toString.call(v)` for an `any` `v` is
`__object_proto_to_string_runtime`, and in a module using only that spelling the
other two are absent — instrumentation confirmed it is the ONLY consumer emitted.

**Scoping, proven not asserted.** An 11-module sha256 corpus, `--target
standalone`, branch-without-fix vs here: **exactly one module's bytes move** —
the one that BOTH builds an iterator record AND calls `Object.prototype.toString`.
Plain-object toString, array iteration, TypedArray iteration, Map/Set, string
iteration, generators, ArrayBuffer/DataView, a no-iterator module, the
toString matrix and a class prototype are all byte-identical.

### Pin updates — stronger, not relaxed

Two nulls compare EQUAL, so every identity assertion is paired with a
non-nullness cross-check that a fully-broken build fails.

- **Pin 1** now asserts a LIVE cursor: the old assertion survives inverted
  (`firstIsNullish === 0`), plus first value/done, the full 3-step-then-exhaust
  sequence, and CURSOR INDEPENDENCE across two sites — which rules out the two
  ways a nominally live cursor is still broken (restarting, or shared).
- **Pin 2** shape A now asserts **ten** bits: four non-null prototypes (Array,
  Map, Set, String) *and* all six pairwise distinctions, reached through an
  `any` local, i.e. the RUNTIME route an ordinary test262 program takes.
  Discrimination measured: **base `66405a1244` scores 113, here 1023** — the
  cleared bits are exactly the three null-ness bits and the three
  null-vs-null pairwise bits.
- **Pin 4** drops two control lines that pinned base answers base only gave
  because the receiver was the wrong object (`[object Array]` for a plain-array
  iterator — a snapshot vec answering for itself; a Map iterator THROWING). Both
  now assert the spec answer, plus a `neitherIteratorTagIsPlain` cross-check
  that the two tags are distinct and neither falls back to `[object Array]`.
  Genuine neighbours (plain object, plain array) are still asserted unchanged.

**Negative control:** collapsing the arm so every family reports
`[object Array Iterator]` turns pin 4 red (1 failed / 26 passed); restored
afterwards and the file is byte-identical to the validated fix.

### Not closed here

- S3's `prependIterRecPrototypeArm` (the round-1 kind-VEC → `%ArrayIteratorPrototype%`
  prepend on `__getPrototypeOf`) is now **redundant**: S1's `__iter_rec_proto`
  answers the same question per-family and correctly. Measured harmless — in a
  module that arms the flag AND asks a string iterator's prototype, the string
  iterator still reports `%StringIteratorPrototype%` (bitmask 63/63), so it is
  not shadowing. Left in place rather than removed as out-of-scope cleanup.

## S4 — `arguments` iterator observes its logical `length` (completed slice, 2026-09-20)

### Scope and claim boundary

This is a narrow residual discovered after S1–S3. Its only implementation
ownership is `src/codegen/iterator-native.ts`, plus one focused pin in
`tests/issue-6484-iterator-prototypes.test.ts`. It must not change `$__IterRec`
layout, any IR/selected-factory/struct-layout code, `object-runtime.ts`, the
arguments branding/runtime implementation, or the RegExp/raw-object work being
landed separately. Array and TypedArray iterator paths remain on their existing
fast path.

The live upstream claim gate found no open upstream PR matching #6484,
`ArrayIteratorPrototype`, `MapIteratorPrototype`, `SetIteratorPrototype`, or
this `arguments` slice. The historical compiler `d5e585` / oracle-14 snapshot
is diagnosis only, not a current-main pass claim: after filtering with the
current ES2015 edition map it has 54 direct iterator-prototype rows, 51 pass
and these three non-passes:

1. `built-ins/ArrayIteratorPrototype/next/args-mapped-truncation-before-exhaustion.js`
2. `built-ins/ArrayIteratorPrototype/next/args-unmapped-truncation-before-exhaustion.js`
3. `built-ins/ArrayIteratorPrototype/next/detach-typedarray-in-progress.js`

The first two are the fix target. The third is a TypedArray detachment-family
control (#1645/#3975), not an iterator-prototype or S4 fix target; it must be
measured separately and left unchanged by this slice.

### Diagnosis

`arguments` is represented by the `$__arguments_vec` subtype. An assignment to
its ordinary `length` property records an override value/flag without changing
the physical vector length in field 0 — correctly, because `arguments.length`
is an ordinary configurable property rather than Array exotic length. Direct
`arguments[Symbol.iterator]()` creates a live VEC `$__IterRec`; its step body
currently compares the cursor only with that physical field 0. Consequently,
after two `next()` calls and `arguments.length = 2`, it still exposes argument
three. Both mapped and unmapped rows exercise this same path.

### Implementation plan

1. In the iterator step/check in `iterator-native.ts`, add a narrowly guarded
   `$__arguments_vec` path that obtains the **logical** arguments length on
   every `next()` call. Preserve the existing physical-vector check unchanged
   for ordinary Array and TypedArray carriers. A logical length grown beyond
   the backing argument count must not feed an out-of-bounds `array.get`:
   obtain the missing-index answer through the existing authoritative arguments
   indexed-get path (normally `undefined`), preserving ordinary indexed
   properties if they exist.
2. Interpret an assigned `arguments.length` using the compiler's authoritative
   `ToLength` semantics, including non-numeric and boundary values; do not use
   a raw floating-point cast or merely special-case the numeric value `2`.
   Preserve abrupt conversion/evaluation order. The override is observable
   between steps, so do not cache or write back a bound, and do not mutate
   field 0. Observable deletion of that ordinary property is a separately
   tracked #4622/#3251 descriptor-sidecar residual; S4 must not fake a
   tombstone or expand into that owner.
3. Keep exhausted-cursor behavior intact: once the logical bound is reached,
   return the normal done result and retain the existing `INT32_MAX` exhaustion
   latch. Test the latch before any later large `ToLength` result so an iterator
   exhausted at a short bound can never be revived by assigning a huge length.
   After a successful length check, advance the cursor before the indexed Get:
   ES2015 [`%ArrayIteratorPrototype%.next`, steps 11–15](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/#sec-%arrayiteratorprototype%.next)
   writes `[[ArrayLikeNextIndex]]` before `Get(O, index)`. Thus a throwing or
   reentrant indexed getter consumes that index, whereas an abrupt length
   conversion remains before the advance.
4. Add a compact standalone pin covering mapped and unmapped `arguments` after
   mid-iteration truncation, a growth-past-argument-count case, an
   exhausted-then-huge-length case, and string/object/abrupt conversion cases
   sufficient to distinguish `ToLength` from a raw cast, plus a throwing
   indexed-get continuation control. Keep the detachment row out of that pin
   because it belongs to the separate TypedArray detach family. Keep the
   no-inherited-length post-delete expectation in an explicit #4622/#3251
   expected-failure handoff, not in this S4 acceptance score.

### Deferred post-delete and inherited-length limitation

ECMAScript's ordinary `Get(arguments, "length")` after deletion can find an
inherited data property or accessor, including after `Object.setPrototypeOf`;
an accessor must receive the original arguments object as its receiver. The
current arguments delete lowering only reports success; it cannot record the
deleted named key, so both own-property queries and direct reads still see the
surviving carrier value. The available receiver-aware prototype companion
helper also models fixed implicit carrier brands (and classifies a vec as
Array) rather than an arbitrary changed arguments prototype. This S4 slice
must not hard-code `Object.prototype`, invent a tombstone, or invoke an
inherited accessor with the wrong receiver. The #4622/#3251 handoff must first
make deletion observable; full inherited lookup remains an independent
object-runtime/prototype-chain residual outside this ownership boundary.

### Validation plan

First run exactly the three original test262 paths above with
`scripts/run-test262-paths.mts --isolate --standalone` on a verified
upstream-main worktree, and record the terminal per-row verdicts before source
edits. After the implementation, rerun those same three originals and the
focused pin: both arguments rows must move from their original non-pass state
to pass, while the detachment control is reported separately and not claimed as
fixed. Run only the approved scoped controls after the shared compiler lease is
granted; no empty or missing corpus result is evidence of a pass.

### #4622/#3251 post-delete handoff (still failing; not S4 acceptance)

The no-inherited-length program in
`tests/issue-6484-iterator-prototypes.test.ts` is deliberately an `it.fails`
handoff. Its bit mask is: override read after `arguments.length = 1` (1),
`delete arguments.length` returns true (2), no own `length` remains (4), direct
post-delete Get is `undefined` (8), the pre-existing iterator is done (16),
and its value is `undefined` (32). The ECMAScript expectation is therefore
63. This is separate from the S4 positive score, which only exercises the
new iterator arm after observable length assignments.

Its compile, instantiation, execution, and zero-host-import check run in an
ordinary `beforeAll`; the expected-failure body asserts only value 63. Thus a
toolchain or standalone-import failure cannot be misreported as the known
deletion residual.

The exact direct-property control and iterator control both instead produced
3 (only bits 1 and 2), with zero host imports, in both comparisons below:

- candidate compiler: this worktree at base
  `4c43798b4979c6f5497b8fc1eca996f8c572c942` plus source-only S4 diff
  `a9dde716849549ef031a3f9bb5d9597c6fb781b294e047c7a287fc8da552c41e`;
  durable receipt
  `/private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920-delete-probe-20260920.log`;
- untouched compiler: detached, provisioned
  `/private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920-baseline-4c` at
  `4c43798b4979c6f5497b8fc1eca996f8c572c942`; durable receipt
  `/private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920-delete-probe-4c-20260920.log`.

The matching baseline proves this is not an S4 regression. Existing
`src/codegen/arguments-object-mop.ts` and
`tests/issue-4622.test.ts` identify the needed owner as the #3251 arguments
descriptor-sidecar representation. A later, separately claimed fix/PR must
repair that source and then revisit inherited receiver-correct Get; this PR
must retain the visible expected failure rather than lowering S4's expected
score to conceal it. It is not automatically the next ES2015 slice: select an
actual current ES2015 non-pass original and reproduce it on the then-current
baseline before expanding into #3251 substrate work.

### Candidate receipt (2026-09-20; two target originals only)

The first post-source candidate run deliberately excluded the independent
TypedArray-detachment control and used this exact two-row manifest:

`/private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920-candidate.paths`

Its SHA-256 is
`aaa46d8aedd23fa924f10387ffc42b99406237d7547c776899da9e8d6387db3f`; both
entries were independently resolved beneath `test262/test`. The worktree base
was `4c43798b4979c6f5497b8fc1eca996f8c572c942`; the source-only candidate diff
(`git diff --no-ext-diff -- src/codegen/iterator-native.ts`) SHA-256 was
`a9dde716849549ef031a3f9bb5d9597c6fb781b294e047c7a287fc8da552c41e`.

Command (from `/private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920`):

```sh
VITEST_FORK_MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE=3072 /Users/thomas/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/node/bin/node --import tsx scripts/run-test262-paths.mts /private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920-candidate.paths --isolate --standalone
```

The agent tool result was exit 0 after 16.621 seconds, with terminal summary
`{ pass: 2 }` and `0 non-pass (excluding skip)`. No durable terminal log was
captured for this run; this is a tool-result receipt, not a reconstructed log.
All later validation runs must capture an independently readable terminal log.

### Guarded final validation receipt (2026-09-20)

The focused standalone file was rerun after the #4622/#3251 handoff was moved
behind ordinary `beforeAll` compilation/import validation:

```sh
VITEST_FORK_MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE=3072 /Users/thomas/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/node/bin/node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/issue-6484-iterator-prototypes.test.ts
```

It exited 0; durable log:
`/private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920-issue6484-focused-guarded-20260920.log`.
The account is 12 ordinary conformance controls passed plus one explicit,
separately compiled #4622/#3251 expected failure; Vitest's aggregate `13
passed` must not be described as 13 conformance passes.

The exact two target originals were then retained with the already verified
two-path manifest (SHA-256
`aaa46d8aedd23fa924f10387ffc42b99406237d7547c776899da9e8d6387db3f`):

```sh
VITEST_FORK_MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE=3072 /Users/thomas/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/node/bin/node --import tsx scripts/run-test262-paths.mts /private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920-candidate.paths --isolate --standalone
```

It exited 0 with `{ pass: 2 }` and `0 non-pass (excluding skip)`; durable log:
`/private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920-original2-retention-20260920.log`.
The separate typed-array detachment control remains unclaimed and was not
included in this retention result.

**S4 completion boundary.** The two mapped/unmapped arguments originals now
pass on the final publication tree, and the focused suite retains its 12
ordinary controls. This completes the owned S4 live-length slice only. #6484
as a whole remains `in-progress`: the independent TypedArray-detachment row
and the separately tracked #4622/#3251 post-delete behavior are not closed or
claimed by this branch.

### Post-sync publication-tree receipt (2026-09-20)

After checkpoint `d08cb026cd2ac94b5d5f54fbe1316e6c1caf0e83`, the branch normally
merged upstream `200f7e2c8bc00dfb9a9c50dcc4b6570413f8a567` at
`b4d05facdaa1ecc8b3e6a2d2ca602a6d1c90469f`. The merge changed only the
upstream edition-closeout documentation; nevertheless, both scoped validation
commands were repeated on that final publication tree.

The exact two-original manifest again exited 0 with `{ pass: 2 }` and `0
non-pass (excluding skip)`; durable log:
`/private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920-original2-final-tree-20260920.log`.
The guarded focused suite again exited 0; it has 12 ordinary conformance
controls and one explicitly separate #4622/#3251 expected failure, not 13
conformance passes; durable log:
`/private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920-focused-final-tree-20260920.log`.

### Publication handoff blocker (2026-09-20)

The completed local branch is
`codex/6484-iterator-residual-20260920a` at checkpoint
`0ab8d03e0d72710d971be203de7c1929c9167db4`. Its normal commit hooks completed
with formatting/lint, LOC/function budgets, the changed-root focused suite,
and the oracle ratchet green (the focused aggregate is still 12 ordinary
controls plus the separate expected #4622/#3251 failure).

The ordinary fork push remains pending. An earlier sandboxed
`git push --set-upstream fork codex/6484-iterator-residual-20260920a` could not
resolve GitHub, and a later retry was denied before execution; neither attempt
made network contact or created a remote branch or PR. On 2026-09-20 the user
explicitly authorized a normal fork-feature-branch push and an unsigned commit
for completed fixes. This branch now awaits the serialized normal-hook slot;
it must still run those hooks and use only `fork`, never push to `main`. The
prepared PR body is
`/private/tmp/js2-6484-iterator-residual-terra-20260920-pr-body.md`; it uses
the canonical website issue links and leaves the CLA checkbox unchecked.
