# #988 -- FinalizationRegistry constructor unsupported in official-scope tests (23 CE)

## Problem

The latest full recheck (`benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260407-111308.jsonl`)
still contains **23 compile errors** with:

```text
Unsupported new expression for class: FinalizationRegistry
```

These used to be folded into the broader built-in-constructor umbrella, but the
residual bucket is now small and specific enough to track independently.

## Representative samples

- `test/built-ins/FinalizationRegistry/prototype/register/unregisterToken-same-as-holdings.js` — `L23:28`
- `test/built-ins/FinalizationRegistry/prototype/register/throws-when-target-cannot-be-held-weakly.js` — `L15:28`
- `test/built-ins/FinalizationRegistry/prototype/register/unregisterToken-same-as-holdings-and-target.js` — `L24:28`
- `test/built-ins/FinalizationRegistry/unnaffected-by-poisoned-cleanupCallback.js` — `L19:28`
- `test/built-ins/FinalizationRegistry/prototype/unregister/unregister-symbol-token.js` — `L22:11`
- `test/built-ins/Object/seal/seal-finalizationregistry.js` — `L36:13`

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§26.2 FinalizationRegistry Objects](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-finalization-registry-objects) — constructor and prototype methods
- [§26.2.1 The FinalizationRegistry Constructor](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-finalization-registry-constructor) — step 2: cleanupCallback must be callable


## Root cause

`new FinalizationRegistry(...)` is still not recognized by the `NewExpression`
built-in constructor handling. Unlike SharedArrayBuffer or BigInt typed arrays,
there is no active focused issue tracking the residual constructor gap.

This may ultimately depend on broader WeakRef/FinalizationRegistry semantics, but
the current bucket is specifically about the constructor path failing at compile
time before any registry behavior executes.

## Suggested fix

1. Decide whether to:
   - implement a minimal extern-class constructor path, or
   - skip these tests behind a documented unsupported-feature filter
2. If implemented, make `new FinalizationRegistry(cleanupCallback)` compile and
   surface enough host behavior for `register`/`unregister` argument validation
3. If skipped, ensure every skip reason references this issue

## Acceptance criteria

- either >=20 of 23 compile errors removed, or the bucket is intentionally
  skipped with a documented issue-linked reason

## Implementation

Chose the skip-filter approach. FinalizationRegistry requires GC finalizer
callbacks which are not implementable in Wasm — the same rationale as
SharedArrayBuffer (shared memory) and BigInt64Array.

Added a skip filter in `tests/test262-runner.ts` `shouldSkip()` (after line 214):
- Path-based: `/built-ins\/FinalizationRegistry/` covers all 22 tests in that directory
- Feature-based: `meta.features?.includes("FinalizationRegistry")` covers the 1 test in
  `Object/seal/seal-finalizationregistry.js` that lives outside the dedicated directory

All 23 CE tests now become SKIP instead of compile_error.

## Test Results

All 23 sample tests from the issue now skip cleanly with reason:
"ES2021: FinalizationRegistry requires GC finalizer callbacks, not implementable in Wasm (#988)"
