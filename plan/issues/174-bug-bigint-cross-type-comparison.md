# #174 — Bug: BigInt cross-type comparison and arithmetic failures

## Status: in-review
## Summary
BigInt comparison with Number and Boolean types produces wrong results or traps. 15 test262 failures across equality, relational, and unary operators when BigInt operands are compared against other types.

## Motivation
Affects 15 test262 failures:
- `bigint-and-number.js` in equals, does-not-equals, strict-equals, strict-does-not-equals, greater-than, greater-than-or-equal, less-than, less-than-or-equal (8 tests return 0)
- `bigint-and-boolean.js` in strict-equals, strict-does-not-equals (2 tests return 0)
- `bigint-and-non-finite.js` in greater-than, greater-than-or-equal, less-than, less-than-or-equal (4 tests trap with "float unrepresentable in integer range")
- `unary-minus/bigint.js` (1 test returns 0)

Root cause: BigInt is represented as i64 in wasm. When comparing BigInt with Number (f64), the codegen truncates f64 to i64, which traps on Infinity/NaN. Cross-type comparison needs safe conversion paths.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — comparison and unary operator codegen for BigInt operands
- Need guards for non-finite f64 values before i64 truncation

## Complexity
M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] BigInt == Number comparisons produce correct results (no traps on Infinity/NaN)
- [x] BigInt === Number returns false (different types)
- [x] BigInt === Boolean returns false (different types)
- [x] -BigInt works correctly
- [x] 15 test262 failures fixed

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Verified that the BigInt cross-type comparison functionality described in this issue was **already implemented** by issues #227 and #228. Added comprehensive equivalence tests (10 test cases) confirming correctness of all identified failure patterns.

### Implementation details (already present in codebase)
The existing code in `compileBinaryExpression` (expressions.ts lines 3074-3161) handles all cross-type BigInt cases:

1. **BigInt === Number/Boolean**: TS type-aware path detects `leftIsBigInt !== rightIsBigInt` and emits `i32.const 0` (always false for ===) or `i32.const 1` (always true for !==)
2. **BigInt == Number**: Converts i64 to f64 via `f64.convert_i64_s` (trap-free), then uses `f64.eq`
3. **BigInt == Boolean**: Boolean (i32) is converted to f64 via `f64.convert_i32_s`, BigInt to f64, then `f64.eq`
4. **Non-finite comparisons (NaN/Infinity)**: Converting BigInt to f64 via `f64.convert_i64_s` is always safe. All f64 comparison ops (`f64.lt`, `f64.gt`, etc.) handle NaN correctly (return false)
5. **Unary minus**: `i64.const 0` then `i64.sub` (lines 7177-7184)
6. **Compiled-type fallback**: Mixed i64/f64 path (lines 3259-3293) also handles strict/loose equality and relational ops

### What worked
- The `f64.convert_i64_s` approach avoids all traps (unlike `i64.trunc_f64_s` which traps on NaN/Infinity)
- f64 comparison ops naturally handle NaN (all comparisons return false) and Infinity correctly
- TS type system reliably detects BigInt types via `isBigIntType()`

### Files changed
- `tests/equivalence/bigint-cross-type.test.ts` (NEW) — 10 equivalence tests covering all acceptance criteria

### Tests now passing
All 10 new equivalence tests pass:
- bigint == non-finite numbers (NaN, Infinity, -Infinity)
- bigint != non-finite numbers
- bigint relational (<, >, <=, >=) with non-finite numbers
- bigint === number always false
- bigint === boolean always false
- unary minus on bigint
- bigint == boolean loose equality
- bigint == number with fractional values
- bigint relational with non-finite (number on left)
- bigint number-extremes equality (Number.MIN_VALUE)
