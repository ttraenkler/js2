# #430 — String-to-number coercion for non-addition arithmetic operators (36 CE)

## Problem

36 tests fail with "Unsupported string operator: XToken" when both operands are strings but the operator is not `+`. In JavaScript, `"1" - "1"` is valid and returns `0` (both operands are coerced to numbers via ToNumber). The compiler currently only handles string `+` (concatenation) and does not coerce strings to numbers for other operators.

### Affected operators and counts

| Operator | Token | CE count |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `*` | AsteriskToken | 5 |
| `/` | SlashToken | 5 |
| `%` | PercentToken | 5 |
| `&` | AmpersandToken | 5 |
| `\|` | BarToken | 5 |
| `^` | CaretToken | 5 |
| `<<` | LessThanLessThanToken | 4 |
| `>>` | GreaterThanGreaterThanToken | 4 |
| `-` | MinusToken | 3 |

### Sample failing tests

- `test/language/expressions/subtraction/S11.6.2_A3_T1.3.js` -- `"1" - "1" === 0`
- `test/language/expressions/multiplication/S11.5.1_A3_T1.3.js` -- `"1" * "1" === 1`
- `test/language/expressions/division/S11.5.2_A3_T1.3.js` -- `"1" / "1" === 1`

## Root cause

In `compileBinaryExpression`, when both operands are typed as strings (externref/stringref), the compiler dispatches to string-specific operators. For `+`, this correctly becomes string concatenation. For all other arithmetic/bitwise operators, it throws "Unsupported string operator" instead of coercing both operands to f64 via a parseFloat/ToNumber conversion and then performing numeric arithmetic.

## Fix approach

When the operator is not `+` and one or both operands are strings, emit ToNumber coercion (e.g., call to `parseFloat` or inline `string.to_f64` if available) before performing the numeric operation. This matches JS semantics: `"3" - "1"` evaluates to `2`.

## Priority: medium (36 tests)

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `"1" - "1"` compiles and returns `0`
- [x] `"3" * "2"` compiles and returns `6`
- [x] `"x" - "1"` compiles and returns `NaN`
- [x] All 9 operator types handle string operands via ToNumber coercion
- [ ] Reduce "Unsupported string operator" CEs to zero (to be verified with test262)

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
When `compileStringBinaryOp` encounters arithmetic or bitwise operators (-, *, **, /, %, &, |, ^, <<, >>, >>>), instead of erroring with "Unsupported string operator", both string operands are now coerced to f64 via `parseFloat` (or `__unbox_number` as fallback), then the operation is delegated to `compileNumericBinaryOp`.

### Changes

**`src/codegen/expressions.ts`** — `compileStringBinaryOp`:
- Fast mode (native strings): The `default` case in the switch now converts native string refs to externref via `extern.convert_any`, then to f64 via `parseFloat`/`__unbox_number`, and delegates to `compileNumericBinaryOp`.
- Non-fast mode (externref strings): Added an early check for arithmetic/bitwise operators before the switch. Both operands are compiled and immediately converted to f64 via `parseFloat`/`__unbox_number`, then delegated to `compileNumericBinaryOp`.

**`src/codegen/index.ts`** — `collectParseImports`:
- Added detection of binary expressions with arithmetic/bitwise operators where one or both operands are strings, to ensure the `parseFloat` host import is registered.

**`tests/equivalence/string-arithmetic-coercion.test.ts`** — new test file:
- 11 tests covering: -, *, /, %, &, |, ^, <<, >>, non-numeric string producing NaN, and string subtraction returning zero.

### What worked
All 11 new equivalence tests pass. No regressions in existing tests (comparison-coercion, compound-assignment-coercion, bigint tests all still pass).
