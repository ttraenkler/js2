# #345 -- Symbol.iterator and iterable protocol

## Status: open

702 tests require Symbol.iterator support. Needs Symbol type implementation plus the iterable/iterator protocol for for-of, spread, destructuring.

## Details

The iterable protocol requires:
1. A Symbol type (unique immutable values)
2. Well-known symbols (Symbol.iterator, Symbol.toPrimitive, etc.)
3. The iterator protocol: objects with a `next()` method returning `{value, done}`
4. Integration with for-of, spread, and destructuring

Implementation approach:
1. Represent symbols as unique i32 IDs (well-known symbols get fixed IDs)
2. Objects that implement the iterable protocol have a special field for the iterator factory
3. for-of calls `[Symbol.iterator]()` to get an iterator, then loops calling `.next()`
4. Spread and array destructuring use the same mechanism

This is a foundational feature that many other features depend on.

## Complexity: XL

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Symbol.iterator is recognized
- [ ] Objects can implement the iterable protocol
- [ ] for-of works with custom iterables
- [ ] Spread works with custom iterables
- [ ] 702 previously skipped tests are now attempted
