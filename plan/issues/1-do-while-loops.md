# Issue 1: do-while loops

## Status: done

## Summary
Support `do { ... } while (condition)` statements.

## Motivation
A common control-flow pattern. The body executes at least once before the condition is checked.

## Wasm lowering
```
block $break          ;; break target
  loop $continue      ;; continue target
    <body>
    <condition>
    <ensureI32Condition>
    br_if $continue   ;; br 0: continue loop if true
  end
end                   ;; br 1: break out
```
`break` inside the body → `br 1`, `continue` → `br 0` (same as while/for).

## Scope
- File: `src/codegen/statements.ts`
- Add `compileDoWhileStatement` and dispatch from `compileStatement` via `ts.isDoStatement`.
- Tests: add a test case in `tests/codegen.test.ts` or `tests/equivalence.test.ts`.

## Acceptance criteria
- `do { i = i + 1; } while (i < 10)` compiles and produces correct results.
- `break` and `continue` inside a do-while work correctly.
