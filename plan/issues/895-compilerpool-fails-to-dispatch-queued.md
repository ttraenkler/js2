# #895 -- CompilerPool fails to dispatch queued jobs when first worker becomes ready

## Problem

The unified test262 runner reported widespread `compile_timeout` failures at exactly 30 seconds on macOS, even for tests that historically passed.

Root cause: in `scripts/compiler-pool.ts`, jobs could be queued before the child fork sent its initial `ready` message. The `ready` handler marked the worker ready, but did **not** call `dispatch()`. As a result:

- the worker sat idle
- the queued job never started
- the parent's 30s timeout fired
- the timeout looked like a compiler hang, but the worker had never received the job

This race made many tests appear to "hang" even though direct in-process compilation of the same wrapped source completed in milliseconds.

## Fix approach

Call `dispatch()` immediately when a worker first reports `ready`, so any already-queued jobs are assigned as soon as the worker is usable.

## Acceptance criteria

- isolated formerly timing-out test262 cases run instead of idling for 30s
- full chunked `test:262` run produces real pass/fail/compile-error results instead of fake queueing timeouts

## Verification

- `COMPILER_POOL_SIZE=1 npx vitest run tests/test262-chunk11.test.ts -t '10.6-12-1.js'`
  - before fix: `compile_timeout` at 30s
  - after fix: pass in under 1s
- full `pnpm run test:262` completed all `48,174` tests on macOS with real result categories
- Merged in commit `bd26b5f5`
