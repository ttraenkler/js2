## Problem

When calling a class method with `.call(thisArg)` or `.apply(thisArg, args)`, the compiler did not perform a brand-check to verify that `thisArg` is an instance of the correct class. Methods with private field access would trap or produce wrong results on invalid receivers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `MyClass.prototype.method.call(wrongObj)` throws TypeError
- [x] Brand-check applied before private field access via `.call()`/`.apply()`
- [x] test262 class brand-check tests pass

## Implementation

Merged via PR #227 (branch `issue-private-access-brand-check`).
