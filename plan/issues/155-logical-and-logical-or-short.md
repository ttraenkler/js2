# #155 — Logical-and/logical-or short-circuit returns wrong value

## Problem
Short-circuit evaluation did not correctly return the last evaluated operand value when left and right sides had different wasm types. JS semantics: `true && null` returns `null`, `false || undefined` returns `undefined`. The compiler was forcing both branches to the left-hand-side type, which lost null/undefined values when the left was i32/f64.

## Fix
- `compileLogicalAnd` / `compileLogicalOr` now compile the RHS without a type hint to discover its natural type
- When left and right types differ, a common result type is chosen (externref for mixed ref/primitive, f64 for mixed i32/f64)
- Both branches are coerced to the common type
- Also fixed `compileBinaryExpression` to handle mixed externref/i32 types in equality comparisons: the boolean/numeric dispatch guards now check actual wasm types, and the externref equality path coerces i32 operands to f64 before comparison

## Tests fixed
- `S11.11.1_A4_T4` (logical-and): `true && null !== null` — was returning 0, now returns null
- `S11.11.2_A3_T4` (logical-or): `false || null !== null` — was returning 0, now returns null

## Status: done
