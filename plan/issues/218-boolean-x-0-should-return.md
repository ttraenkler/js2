# Issue #218: Boolean(x = 0) should return false

## Status: in-review
## Problem
The test262 runner skips tests using `Boolean()` with assignment expression arguments
(e.g., `Boolean(x = 0)`) or empty string arguments (`Boolean("")`). These patterns
are actually handled correctly by the codegen but were being skipped unnecessarily.

## Root cause
A skip filter in `tests/test262-runner.ts` at line 465 was blocking these tests:
```
if (/Boolean\s*\(\s*(\w+\s*=\s*|"")/.test(source))
```

The codegen already handles:
- `Boolean(x = 0)`: assignment returns the assigned value (f64), Boolean checks != 0 && == self
- `Boolean("")`: string length > 0 check

## Fix
- Removed the Boolean skip filter from `tests/test262-runner.ts`
- Added equivalence tests verifying:
  - `Boolean(x = 0)` returns false
  - `Boolean(x = 1)` returns true
  - `Boolean("")` returns false
  - `Boolean("hello")` returns true
  - `Boolean(NaN)` returns false
  - `Boolean(-0)` returns false
  - Assignment side effects are preserved when used as Boolean argument

## Tests
- 4 new equivalence tests in `tests/equivalence.test.ts`
