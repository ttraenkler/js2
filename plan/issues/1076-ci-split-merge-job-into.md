# #1076 — Split merge job so push-to-main always refreshes baseline

## Problem

`.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml` had a single `merge` job that both
built the merged test262 report AND enforced the regression gate.
`promote-baseline` depended on `needs.merge.result == 'success'`, so any
regression blocked baseline promotion and drift accumulated silently.

## Implementation

Already implemented. Verified 2026-04-24 by reading `.github/workflows/test262-sharded.yml`:

- Job `merge-report` (line 148): downloads shards, merges JSONL, builds report, uploads artifact. Always succeeds unless shard run itself is broken.
- Job `regression-gate` (line 202): `needs: merge-report`. Downloads merged artifact, diffs against committed baseline, fails on regressions. Its failure does NOT block promotion.
- Job `promote-baseline` (line 263): `needs: merge-report`. Runs on push/workflow_dispatch regardless of `regression-gate` outcome. Sanity check (`PASS < 1000 || TOTAL < 40000`) still guards against corrupt reports.

The split was already in place before this issue was worked in sprint 45.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `promote-baseline` runs on push-to-main regardless of regression-gate outcome
- [x] `regression-gate` fails visibly when regressions exist, without blocking promotion
- [x] Sanity check still rejects corrupt reports
