# #653 — Timeout epidemic: 6,715 tests (Temporal + statements)

## Status: open

6,715 tests timeout at 90s. Two categories dominate:
- **Temporal** (3,381): Temporal API stubs don't exist, so tests spin trying to construct Temporal objects
- **statements** (3,196): Complex class/generator patterns cause slow compilation

### Fix
1. Re-enable Temporal skip (was disabled by SKIP_DISABLED) — saves 3,381 timeouts
2. Profile the slowest statement compilations and optimize or increase timeout for that category

## Complexity: S
