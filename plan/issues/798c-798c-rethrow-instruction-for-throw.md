# #798c -- Rethrow instruction for throw-of-catch-variable

## Implementation summary

Emit `rethrow` instruction when `throw` is used on the catch variable inside a catch block. This preserves the original exception identity (important for foreign JS exceptions) instead of wrapping it in a new `throw $tag`. Bundled with #798b.
