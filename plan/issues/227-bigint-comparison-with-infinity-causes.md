# Issue #227: BigInt comparison with Infinity causes float-unrepresentable trap

## Status: done

## Summary

4 tests fail with `RuntimeError: float unrepresentable in integer range` when comparing BigInt values with `Infinity` or `-Infinity`. Tests like `bigint-and-non-finite.js` compare `0n > -Infinity` which should return `true`, but the i64-to-f64 conversion traps when encountering non-finite floats.

## Root Cause

BigInt is compiled as i64. When comparing BigInt with Number, the codegen converts f64 to i64 via `i64.trunc_f64_s`, which traps on Infinity/NaN. The correct approach is to convert the i64 to f64 first (`f64.convert_i64_s`) and then do f64 comparison, since any finite f64 comparison with i64-range values is representable.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- BigInt comparison paths
- Tests affected: 4 (bigint-and-non-finite in greater-than, less-than, >=, <=)

## Expected Impact

Fixes 4 runtime failures (BigInt + Infinity comparisons).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] BigInt vs Infinity/NaN comparisons do not trap
- [x] All 4 bigint-and-non-finite tests pass
- [x] Existing BigInt comparison tests still pass

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
The codegen fix was already in place in `compileBinaryExpression` (lines ~2569-2656 and ~2754-2775 of `src/codegen/expressions.ts`). The implementation:

1. **TS-type-level detection** (lines 2569-2656): When `isBigIntType()` detects one BigInt and one Number operand, compiles each with its natural type hint (i64 or f64), then converts i64 to f64 via `f64.convert_i64_s` before doing f64 comparison.
2. **Compiled-type fallback** (lines 2754-2775): When compiled types are mixed i64/f64 (detected at runtime, e.g. from variables), converts the i64 side to f64 using a local variable swap when the i64 operand is on the left.

Both paths avoid `i64.trunc_f64_s` which traps on Infinity/NaN. f64 comparisons handle Infinity naturally and NaN comparisons correctly return false.

Added `tests/issue-227.test.ts` with 6 tests covering:
- BigInt > -Infinity, BigInt < Infinity, BigInt >= -Infinity, BigInt <= Infinity
- BigInt comparisons with NaN (all return false)
- BigInt comparison with finite numbers

### Files changed
- `tests/issue-227.test.ts` (new) -- 6 tests validating BigInt vs Infinity/NaN/Number comparisons

### Tests passing
All 6 tests in `tests/issue-227.test.ts` pass. No regressions in existing tests.
