# #1112 — delete operator via undefined sentinel (232 tests)

## Status: open (moved from wont-fix)

Previously labeled "won't implement" — reassessed as achievable.

## Approach

`delete obj.prop` can't remove a WasmGC struct field, but can set it to a sentinel:

1. `delete obj.prop` → `struct.set obj $prop (ref.null)` or undefined sentinel
2. `obj.prop` after delete → returns undefined (check sentinel)
3. `"prop" in obj` → false if sentinel
4. `hasOwnProperty("prop")` → false if sentinel

Works for own properties. Prototype chain deletion not applicable (we don't have dynamic prototype chains).

## Complexity: M
