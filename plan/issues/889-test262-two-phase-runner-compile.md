# #889 -- Test262 two-phase runner: compile → disk → execute with GC

## Problem

The single-phase test262 runner accumulates Wasm modules in memory over 48K tests, growing the fork from ~1GB to ~7GB. This causes OOM crashes, prevents running dev agents in parallel, and forces complex sharding workarounds.

## Root cause

Compilation and execution happen in the same process. Compiled Wasm modules stay in V8's code space (outside the JS heap, can't be GC'd) until the process dies.

## Proposed: two-phase approach

### Phase 1: Compile (runner script, before vitest)

- Use the existing `CompilerPool` (cpus()-1 worker threads)
- Compile all 48K tests in parallel
- Write each compiled .wasm binary to disk: `.test262-cache/{hash}.wasm`
- Write compilation metadata (imports, stringPool, errors) alongside: `.test262-cache/{hash}.json`
- No Wasm instantiation — just TypeScript → Wasm binary → disk
- Memory: ~2GB (TS compiler + source), flat (nothing accumulates)
- Time: ~3-5 min with 9 threads

### Phase 2: Execute (vitest, after compilation)

- Vitest reads pre-compiled .wasm from disk per test
- `WebAssembly.instantiate(binary, imports)` → run test → capture result
- **After each test**: null out `instance`, `module`, `binary` references
- **With `--expose-gc`**: call `global.gc()` every N tests to free Wasm code space
- Memory: stays flat (~500MB) — each test loads, runs, discards
- Time: ~5-7 min (instantiate + execute is fast, no compilation)

### Total: ~8-12 min, peak ~2GB (phase 1) or ~500MB (phase 2)

## Implementation

### Phase 1: `scripts/precompile-tests.ts` (already exists, needs updates)

```
1. Build compiler pool (cpus()-1 threads)
2. For each test in TEST_CATEGORIES:
   a. Read source, parse metadata, check skip filters
   b. Wrap test (wrapTest)
   c. Dispatch to pool: compile(wrappedSource)
   d. On result: write {hash}.wasm + {hash}.json to .test262-cache/
3. Report: "Compiled 48,088 tests in Xs (Y cache hits)"
```

The precompiler already does most of this — update it to write the metadata JSON.

### Phase 2: `tests/test262-vitest.test.ts` (simplified)

```typescript
it(relPath, async () => {
  // Read pre-compiled binary from disk
  const meta = JSON.parse(readFileSync(cachePath + '.json', 'utf-8'));
  if (!meta.ok) { recordResult(..., meta.status, meta.error); return; }
  
  const binary = readFileSync(cachePath + '.wasm');
  const imports = buildImports(meta.imports, undefined, meta.stringPool);
  
  // Instantiate, execute, discard
  let instance = (await WebAssembly.instantiate(binary, imports)).instance;
  const result = (instance.exports as any).test();
  
  // Null out and GC to free Wasm code space
  instance = null;
  if (global.gc) global.gc();
  
  recordResult(...);
});
```

### Runner script changes

```bash
# Phase 1: compile all tests
echo "Phase 1: Compiling..."
npx tsx scripts/precompile-tests.ts

# Phase 2: execute pre-compiled tests
echo "Phase 2: Executing..."
npx vitest run tests/test262-vitest.test.ts --reporter=verbose
```

## Key benefits

1. **Flat memory**: no accumulation in either phase
2. **Parallel compilation**: all cores used for compile phase
3. **Simple execution**: vitest just reads files, no compiler pool
4. **Dev agents can run**: execution phase uses ~500MB
5. **Cache reuse**: subsequent runs skip phase 1 if compiler unchanged

## Acceptance criteria

- Full test262 run completes: 17,252+ pass / 48,088 total
- Peak memory < 3GB in either phase
- Total time < 12 min
- Memory stays flat during execution phase (verified by monitor)
- Dev agents can run during execution phase without OOM
