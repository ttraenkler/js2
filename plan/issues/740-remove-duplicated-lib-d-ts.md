# #740 -- Remove duplicated lib.d.ts copies, read from typescript package at runtime

## Status: done

## Problem

`src/checker/lib-*.ts` contains 2.1MB of stringified TypeScript lib files (lib.es5.d.ts, lib.dom.d.ts, etc.) that duplicate what ships with the `typescript` package. They go stale when TS updates.

## Fix

Replace hardcoded string imports with runtime resolution from the installed typescript package.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done

1. **Replaced static lib imports with runtime file reads**: Instead of importing 4 large stringified lib files (lib-es5.ts, lib-dom.ts, lib-decorators.ts, lib-decorators-legacy.ts), the checker now reads these from the installed `typescript` package's `lib/` directory at runtime using `fs.readFileSync`.

2. **Kept custom type declarations**: `lib-generators.ts`, `lib-es2015.ts`, and `lib-es2021.ts` are custom declarations specific to this project (not copies of TS originals) and were preserved.

3. **Lazy loading with caching**: Lib files are loaded on first access via `getLibSource()` and cached in `LIB_FILES` for subsequent calls. The composite `lib.d.ts` is assembled by concatenating runtime-loaded es5 + custom es2015/es2021 + runtime-loaded dom + custom generators.

4. **Deleted 4 bundled lib files**: `lib-es5.ts` (224KB), `lib-dom.ts` (1.9MB), `lib-decorators.ts` (14KB), `lib-decorators-legacy.ts` (1.4KB).

5. **Updated fileExists checks**: Changed from `name in LIB_FILES` (which only works after lazy load) to `KNOWN_LIB_NAMES.has(name)` which is always accurate.

### Results
- Bundle size: 3.6MB -> 1.6MB (saved 2.0MB / 56% reduction)
- All equivalence tests pass with identical results to main (no regressions)
- esbuild bundle with `--external:typescript` builds successfully

### Files changed
- `src/checker/index.ts` -- replaced static imports with runtime resolution
- `src/checker/lib-es5.ts` -- deleted
- `src/checker/lib-dom.ts` -- deleted
- `src/checker/lib-decorators.ts` -- deleted
- `src/checker/lib-decorators-legacy.ts` -- deleted

### What worked
- Using `createRequire(import.meta.url)` as fallback for ESM contexts
- Lazy caching pattern avoids re-reading files on each compile

### What didn't apply
- Browser playground support deferred (left TODO comment for fetch-based approach)
