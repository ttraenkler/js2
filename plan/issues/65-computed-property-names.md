# Issue 65: Computed property names

## Summary

Support computed property names in object literals: `{ [key]: value }`.

## Desired behavior

```ts
const key = "name";
const obj = { [key]: "Alice" };

const field = "x";
const point = { [field]: 1, y: 2 };
```

## Implementation

### Challenge
- Wasm GC structs have fixed field names at compile time
- Computed property names are dynamic — the field name isn't known until runtime

### Approach A: Compile-time resolution (limited)
- If the computed expression is a string literal or const, resolve at compile time
- `{ ["x"]: 1 }` → same as `{ x: 1 }`
- Enum members: `{ [MyEnum.Key]: value }` → resolve enum value

### Approach B: Host-backed object (general)
- Fall back to externref host object for truly dynamic property names
- `{ [key]: value }` → create host object, set property dynamically

### Recommended: Approach A for const expressions, B as fallback
