# Issue 6: Classes

## Status: done

## Summary
Support `class` declarations with constructor, methods, and `this` access.

## Motivation
Classes are the primary OOP construct in TypeScript. Without class support, large TS codebases can't be compiled.

## Design

### Wasm GC mapping
Each class maps to a Wasm GC struct type:
```
(type $MyClass (struct (field $x (mut f64)) (field $y (mut f64))))
```

Constructor → a Wasm function that creates the struct with `struct.new` and returns a `ref $MyClass`.

Methods → Wasm functions that take `(ref $MyClass)` as first parameter (`self`). Method calls on class instances use `call $ClassName_methodName`.

`this` inside a method → `local.get 0` (the implicit first param).

### Inheritance
Not in scope for this issue. Subtyping via Wasm GC's `(sub ...)` types is a future issue.

### Static methods/properties
Not in scope. Can be implemented as module-level functions.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/index.ts`: add class collection pass (`collectClassDeclarations`). Register struct type for each class. Register a function for each method. Handle `this` in `FunctionContext` (flag: `isMethod: boolean`, `selfType: ValType`).
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: `new MyClass(...)` calls the constructor function. `obj.method(...)` calls `ClassName_method(obj, ...)`. `this.prop` → `struct.get` with `local.get 0`.
- `src/codegen/statements.ts`: `this.prop = val` → `struct.set`.
- Tests: new `tests/classes.test.ts`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Constructor creates an instance: `new Point(1, 2)` returns a `ref $Point`.
- Method call: `p.getX()` returns the x field.
- `this` inside a method accesses the correct fields.
- Instance returned from one function can be passed to another.
