# #792 -- emitGuardedRefCast conflates "wrong type" with "null" (net-zero from #789)

## Problem

The #789 fix correctly changed null guards to throw TypeError only for genuinely-null refs. But `emitGuardedRefCast` returns `ref.null` when a ref cast fails (wrong struct type), and downstream null checks then see this as "null" — either throwing TypeError or returning default values. The net effect is zero improvement: tests that previously failed as "null pointer trap" now fail as "TypeError" or "wrong default value".

## Root cause

`emitGuardedRefCast` pattern:
```wasm
local.tee $tmp
ref.test $ExpectedStruct
if (result ref null $ExpectedStruct)
  local.get $tmp
  ref.cast $ExpectedStruct
else
  ref.null $ExpectedStruct   ;; <-- THIS: wrong-type becomes null
end
```

Then any downstream null check (emitNullCheckThrow, if/else on ref.is_null) treats this as a null dereference.

## Fix approach

Instead of returning `ref.null` for wrong-type, `emitGuardedRefCast` should try alternate struct types that have the same field. The compiler already has `findAlternateStructsForField` — use it:

1. In `emitGuardedRefCast`, if the primary `ref.test` fails, try each alternate struct type
2. Only return `ref.null` if ALL alternates also fail (truly unrecognized object)
3. For the externref path: after `any.convert_extern`, check null FIRST, then try multi-struct dispatch

This is essentially making property access polymorphic — a valid object of type B accessing field X should check struct A, struct B, struct C etc. for the field.

## Files to modify

- `src/codegen/property-access.ts` -- `emitGuardedRefCast`, `emitNullGuardedStructGet`
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- call sites that use emitGuardedRefCast

## Acceptance criteria

- Wrong-type objects no longer become ref.null (they dispatch to correct struct)
- Genuinely-null refs still throw TypeError
- Net improvement of 5,000+ tests over current HEAD (16,580 pass)

## Implementation notes (branch: issue-792-multi-struct-dispatch, commit dbf5f185)

### Changes

**`src/codegen/type-coercion.ts`**:
1. `emitGuardedRefCast` saves pre-cast anyref as `(fctx).__lastGuardedCastBackup` temp local
2. New `buildVecFromExternref` function: when externref→vec struct cast fails, constructs WasmGC vec from JS array using `__extern_length` + `__extern_get` loop
3. `getVecInfo` helper: detects `__vec_*` struct types and returns array type info
4. externref→ref/ref_null coercion path: saves externref before `any.convert_extern`, uses `buildVecFromExternref` as else-branch for vec targets, saves backup anyref
5. Removed `ref.as_non_null` for non-null targets to allow downstream multi-struct dispatch

**`src/codegen/property-access.ts`**:
1. `emitNullGuardedStructGet` propName branch: when value is null, checks `__lastGuardedCastBackup`
2. If backup is non-null (wrong struct type), tries primary struct + alternates on backup anyref
3. If backup is null (genuinely null), throws TypeError as before
4. `buildFallback` now takes `srcLocal` parameter to work with either tmpAny or backup

### Key insight
The cross-function boundary is the main challenge: externref→struct coercion happens at call site, but property access happens inside callee. The `buildVecFromExternref` addresses this for the most common case (JS arrays → number[]). The backup mechanism addresses the intra-function case.
