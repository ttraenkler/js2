# #870 -- Playground: Monaco web workers fail to load

## Problem

Monaco editor in the playground fails to create web workers, falling back to main thread execution which causes UI freezes:

```
Could not create web worker(s). Falling back to loading web worker code
in main thread, which might cause UI freezes.
```

Additional errors:
- `[Violation] 'requestIdleCallback' handler took 88ms`
- `[Violation] 'setInterval' handler took 72ms`
- `[Violation] 'requestAnimationFrame' handler took 67ms`
- `Uncaught Event {type: 'error', target: Worker}`

## Root cause

Monaco's web workers need to be served from the same origin. Vite's dev server may not be configured to serve the worker scripts correctly, or the worker URLs are wrong after bundling.

## Fix

1. Configure Vite to handle Monaco workers via `monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/editor.worker`
2. Use `vite-plugin-monaco-editor` or configure `worker` option in vite.config.ts
3. Set `MonacoEnvironment.getWorkerUrl` to point to the correct bundled worker paths

Example:
```ts
window.MonacoEnvironment = {
  getWorker(_, label) {
    if (label === 'typescript' || label === 'javascript') {
      return new Worker(new URL('monaco-editor/esm/vs/language/typescript/ts.worker', import.meta.url));
    }
    return new Worker(new URL('monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/editor.worker', import.meta.url));
  }
};
```

## Acceptance criteria

- Monaco web workers load without errors
- No UI freeze violations in console
- Syntax highlighting and intellisense work smoothly
