# Issue 118: compareArray.js test262 harness include

## Summary

113 test262 tests require `compareArray.js` from the test262 harness. This
include provides `compareArray(a, b)` which checks array length and elements.

## Fix

Add `compareArray.js` to the allowed includes in `shouldSkip()` and provide a
shim implementation in `wrapTest()` that uses our native array operations.

## Impact on Array tests

Directly blocks `Array.prototype.concat` (18 tests), `Array.prototype.splice`,
and other array categories that verify result arrays.

## Complexity

S — Simple shim function + include allowlist update.
