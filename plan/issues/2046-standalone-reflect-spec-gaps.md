# #2046 — Standalone Reflect spec gaps (#1905 follow-up)

## Problem

The #1905 native Reflect subset is structurally sound (dual-mode gating,
fail-loud for apply/construct/defineProperty, index-shift-safe helper
bodies), but review found four spec deviations. The first two produce
**silently wrong values** — worse than the refusals they replaced.

1. **Receiver argument evaluated then dropped** —
   `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts:5067` (`Reflect.get(target, key,
   receiver)`) and `:5081` (`Reflect.set(target, key, value, receiver)`)
   call `emitAndDropOptionalArg`. With accessor properties (live since
   #1888 S5b — `__extern_get`/`__extern_set` invoke stored getters/setters),
   the getter/setter runs with `this = target` instead of `receiver`
   ([§28.1.5 / §28.1.12 → §10.1.8/§10.1.9](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-reflect.get)),
   and `Reflect.set` writes to the wrong object. Minimal fix until receiver
   plumbing exists: **refuse loudly** when `arguments.length > 2` (get) /
   `> 3` (set) — a one-line gate restoring the fail-loud invariant.
2. **`Reflect.deleteProperty` ignores integrity levels and configurability**
   — routing at `calls.ts:5102-5111` into `__delete_property`
   (`src/codegen/object-runtime.ts:1187-1266`), which checks neither
   object-level `OBJ_FLAG_SEALED`/`OBJ_FLAG_FROZEN` nor per-entry
   `FLAG_CONFIGURABLE` (creatable via #1629's `__defineProperty_value`).
   `Reflect.deleteProperty(Object.freeze({x:1}), "x")` **deletes and
   returns true** (spec: keep, return false). Inconsistent with the same
   PR's own `__reflect_set`, which does preflight frozen/non-writable.
   The helper's "data props are always configurable" comment is stale.
3. **Non-object targets** — `Reflect.deleteProperty(primitive, k)` returns
   **true** (`object-runtime.ts:1201-1211`; the arm is correct for sloppy
   `delete`, wrong for Reflect — §28.1.4 requires TypeError). get/has/set
   on primitives return undefined/false/false instead of TypeError
   (`object-runtime.ts:509-516, 1468-1478, 1071-1081`) — less harmful but
   still silent deviations.
4. **No ToPropertyKey** — keys pass as raw externref into `$__obj_hash`
   which `ref.cast $AnyString` (`object-runtime.ts:289`), so
   `Reflect.get(o, 1)` **traps** instead of coercing to `"1"`
   (§7.1.19). Numeric keys are common in the test262 bucket.

Also from review (lower priority): inherited-accessor `Reflect.set` does not
walk the proto chain (documented #1888 scope boundary, consistent with plain
assignment); `tests/issue-1905.test.ts` lacks proto-chain, receiver, and
non-string-key cases; the `fallbackReturn(n, "i32-true")` dead branch at
`calls.ts:5088/5099/5110` would be safer as `i32-false`.

## Suggested order

1. The two one-line gates: refuse explicit receiver args (fix 1) and route
   non-`$Object` deleteProperty to TypeError (fix 3a). Converts
   silent-wrong to loud.
2. Integrity/configurability preflight in the delete route (share
   `__reflect_set`'s existing frozen/sealed checks; honor
   `FLAG_CONFIGURABLE`).
3. ToPropertyKey: brand-switch the key before `__obj_hash` (number →
   numeric-string via the #1335/#1759 number-to-string path; symbol keys
   may refuse loudly for now).
4. Real receiver support (plumb receiver through `__extern_get`/`__extern_set`
   accessor invocation) — coordinate with #1888 Slice 5 accessor work.

## Acceptance criteria

- `Reflect.deleteProperty(Object.freeze({x:1}), "x")` returns false and
  keeps the property; configurable:false entries likewise.
- `Reflect.get(o, 1)` returns `o["1"]` — no trap.
- Explicit-receiver forms either honor the receiver or refuse at compile
  time — never silently mis-bind `this`.
- TypeError (catchable) for non-object targets across all four methods.
- tests/issue-1905.test.ts extended with proto-chain, frozen-delete,
  numeric-key, and receiver cases; standalone test262
  `built-ins/Reflect/{get,set,has,deleteProperty}` rows improve.

## Resolution — PR-A + PR-B (2026-06-14)

PR-A (defects 1 + 3a) and PR-B (defect 2) landed; PR-C (real receiver) is
senior/deferred and PR-D (ToPropertyKey) rides #2042 — both remain, so this
issue stays `in-progress`.

**PR-A — restore fail-loud** (`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`, all inside
`if (ctx.standalone)`):
- **Defect 1 (receiver mis-bind):** `Reflect.get`/`Reflect.set` now refuse
  loudly (`reportError`) when an explicit receiver is present
  (`arguments.length > 2` / `> 3`) instead of evaluating-then-dropping it (which
  silently bound `this = target` for accessors, §28.1.5/§28.1.12 →
  §10.1.8/§10.1.9). Removed the now-dead `emitAndDropOptionalArg`.
- **Defect 3a (non-object deleteProperty):** added a CALL-SITE `ref.test $Object`
  guard on the target; a non-`$Object` target throws a catchable TypeError
  (`emitThrowTypeError`, §28.1.4). The SHARED `__delete_property` helper is
  untouched (sloppy `delete primitive[k]` stays a no-op success).
- Cleanup: the boolean-Reflect `fallbackReturn` dead branches now return
  `i32-false` (registration-failure default), not a phantom `true`.

**PR-B — delete configurability/integrity preflight**
(`src/codegen/object-runtime.ts`, `__delete_property`):
- After finding a live entry, refuse (return 0, keep the prop) when the object
  is sealed/frozen **OR** the entry is non-configurable
  (`FLAG_CONFIGURABLE` cleared), per §10.1.10 OrdinaryDelete.
- **Verified subtlety:** `__object_freeze`/`__object_seal` set only the
  object-level `$Object.flags` `OBJ_FLAG_SEALED` bit and do NOT clear each
  entry's `FLAG_CONFIGURABLE`, so the preflight checks BOTH the object
  `OBJ_FLAG_SEALED` bit and the per-entry `FLAG_CONFIGURABLE` bit.
  `Object.preventExtensions` (NONEXTENSIBLE only, not SEALED) does NOT block
  delete — confirmed. Correct for both `Reflect.deleteProperty` and sloppy
  `delete` (§13.5.1.2 — both refuse a non-configurable own prop).

**Remaining (out of this PR):**
- **PR-C (real receiver plumbing)** — senior/deferred, coordinates with #1888
  Slice 5 accessor-invocation machinery.
- **PR-D (ToPropertyKey)** — `Reflect.get(o, 1)` still traps ("illegal cast" on
  `ref.cast $AnyString` in `__obj_hash`). This is the SAME numeric-key fix as
  #2042 PR-A; reuse #2042's shared key-coercion helper once it lands rather than
  duplicating. Coordinated with dev-b.

## Test Results (2026-06-14)

- `tests/issue-2046.test.ts` (new) — 10/10: explicit-receiver refusal (get+set),
  no-receiver get/set work, non-object deleteProperty throws TypeError,
  object deleteProperty deletes, frozen/sealed deleteProperty → false + kept,
  preventExtensions delete still succeeds, sloppy delete honors freeze, sloppy
  delete normal succeeds.
- `tests/issue-1905.test.ts` — green (4/4, no regression).
- Pre-existing unrelated failures (byte-identical to origin/main, untouched by
  this change): `tests/object-define-property.test.ts` /
  `tests/delete-operator.test.ts` import the broken `tests/helpers.js`;
  `tests/equivalence/reflect-api.test.ts` "Reflect.construct creates a new
  instance" fails identically on clean origin/main (host-mode, not standalone).

## Implementation Plan (architect, 2026-06-17) — s63 gate slice S5 (+ PR-D dependency)

This issue owns slice **S5** of the #1472 gate (see #1472 coordinating spec).
The `standalone-reflect-refusal` bucket is now almost pure CE (295 CE / 20 fail
of 315), so S5 is a refusal-retirement slice.

### Bucket breakdown (report 2026-06-16)
- `Reflect.construct` refusal — 152 rows (largest)
- `Reflect.defineProperty` refusal — 53 rows
- `Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` refusal — 15 rows
- explicit-receiver `Reflect.get`/`Reflect.set` refusal — 29 rows
  (these are **correctly** refused per PR-A — leave them, they are honest)

### PR-D dependency (numeric keys) — consume #2042 S1, do NOT duplicate
The deferred PR-D ("`Reflect.get(o, 1)` still traps on `ref.cast $AnyString` in
`__obj_hash`") is now subsumed by **#2042 S1** (`__to_property_key` hardening at
`__obj_find`/`__obj_hash`). Once S1 lands, `Reflect.get(o, 1)` returns `o["1"]`
with zero extra work here — verify and close PR-D. Coordinate with the S1 dev so
only ONE coercion helper exists.

### S5 fix (`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`, inside the `if (ctx.standalone)`
Reflect dispatch block)
- **`Reflect.defineProperty(t, k, desc)`** → route to the #2042 **S3**
  `__defineProperty_desc` native; return its boolean success as i32 (Reflect
  returns `false` on failure rather than throwing). **Depends on #2042 S3.**
- **`Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(t, k)`** → route to the existing native
  `__getOwnPropertyDescriptor` (already in `OBJECT_RUNTIME_HELPER_NAMES`). No new
  runtime work — just replace the refusal with the call. **No dependency** —
  ship this first as the cheapest win.
- **`Reflect.construct(target, argsList)`** (152 rows, the big one) → route the
  2-arg form to the same construct path standalone `new X(...)` uses; **refuse**
  the 3-arg `newTarget` form (proto override needs the class/proto graph). This
  one is gated on the standalone construct machinery — coordinate with the
  #2158 class/construct owner. If construct plumbing isn't ready, keep its
  refusal and ship the two descriptor wins separately so they aren't blocked.

### Edge cases
- `Reflect.defineProperty` must return a **boolean**, never throw, even when the
  underlying define would TypeError (e.g. non-configurable redefine) — wrap the
  S4 validation so a rejected define returns `false` in the Reflect path while
  `Object.defineProperty` throws. (Same native, two call-site return shapes.)
- Non-object target → already TypeError via PR-A's `ref.test $Object` call-site
  guard; keep it for the new methods too.

### Acceptance signatures
- `built-ins/Reflect/getOwnPropertyDescriptor/*` and
  `built-ins/Reflect/defineProperty/*` standalone rows move refusal → pass.
- `Reflect.get(o, 1)` no longer traps (via #2042 S1).
- `Reflect.construct` 2-arg form passes where standalone `new` already works;
  3-arg form refuses loudly (no silent wrong newTarget).
- Extend `tests/issue-2046.test.ts` / `tests/issue-1905.test.ts` with
  numeric-key get, `Reflect.defineProperty` data+accessor desc, and
  `Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` round-trip.

## S5 slice landed — getOwnPropertyDescriptor + PR-D confirmation (2026-06-21)

PROBE-VERIFIED against current main HEAD (075d90ee5) before any change:

- **PR-D (numeric-key `Reflect.get`) — already fixed, no code change.** `#2042
  S1`'s `__to_property_key` hardening landed, so `Reflect.get(o, 1)` returns
  `o["1"]` (probe: `=> 42`) instead of trapping on the `ref.cast $AnyString` in
  `__obj_hash`. Closed PR-D; pinned with a regression test.
- **`Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` — was still refused; now routed.** The
  native `__getOwnPropertyDescriptor` (registered in `OBJECT_RUNTIME_HELPER_NAMES`)
  is now reachable end-to-end under standalone — verified independently via
  `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` (value/writable/missing all correct). The
  stale registration comment near it (claiming "not reached end-to-end") predates
  #2042's read-side wiring.

**Change** (`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`, inside the `if (ctx.standalone)`
Reflect dispatch block, after the `ownKeys` arm): replaced the
`getOwnPropertyDescriptor` refusal with a route to the native
`__getOwnPropertyDescriptor`, returning the descriptor `$Object` (or `undefined`
for a missing own prop). §26.1.7 step 1 (non-object target → TypeError) is
enforced at the CALL SITE with the same `ref.test $Object`-guard /
`emitThrowTypeError` pattern PR-A introduced for `deleteProperty` — the shared
native (which returns `undefined` for non-`$Object` receivers, correct for the
`Object.*` caller) is untouched. ToPropertyKey on the key is handled inside the
native via `__to_property_key`, so numeric keys work.

New tests in `tests/issue-2046.test.ts` (16/16 green; 1905 4/4 unchanged): gOPD
data value, writable+enumerable+configurable flags, missing-prop→undefined,
numeric-key coercion, non-object→TypeError, and the PR-D numeric-key get pin.

**Still refused (out of this PR, issue stays `in-progress`):**
- **`Reflect.defineProperty`** — blocked on the write-side native
  `__defineProperty_desc` (generic `{value|get|set, writable?, …}` descriptor),
  which is deferred to **#2043** (see the NOTE near `__getOwnPropertyDescriptor`'s
  registration in `object-runtime.ts`). Route it the moment that native lands;
  remember the Reflect path returns `false` on a rejected define rather than
  throwing.
- **`Reflect.construct`** (152 rows, the big one) — gated on the standalone
  construct machinery (coordinate with the #2158 class/construct owner). 2-arg
  form → standalone `new X(...)` path; 3-arg `newTarget` form refuses loudly.
- **PR-C (real receiver plumbing)** — senior/deferred, coordinates with #1888
  Slice 5 accessor invocation; the explicit-receiver get/set refusal stays correct
  meanwhile.

## defineProperty slice landed — route to native applier (2026-06-25)

PROBE-VERIFIED against current main HEAD (064b27657) before any change:
`Reflect.defineProperty(o, "x", {value:42,…})` refused with
"Codegen error: Reflect.defineProperty not supported in standalone mode
(#1472 Phase C)".

**The #2043 blocker recorded above was STALE.** The write-side native
`__obj_define_from_desc` (#1629b) has backed standalone `Object.defineProperty`
since that PR and is registered by `ensureObjectRuntime` / reachable end-to-end —
no new native was needed.

**Change** (`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`, inside the `if (ctx.standalone)`
Reflect dispatch block; `src/codegen/object-ops.ts`): replaced the
`Reflect.defineProperty` refusal with a route through the SAME standalone
runtime-descriptor applier `Object.defineProperty` uses —
`emitDefinePropertyDescRuntime` (now exported). Reusing it (rather than calling
`__obj_define_from_desc` directly) is essential: it performs the **#2372
descriptor-struct reify**, so an INLINE object-literal descriptor
(`{ value: 42, … }`, which the TS checker types as a closed WasmGC struct) is
reified into a `$Object` before the native's internal `ref.test $Object` runs —
otherwise the native raises a spurious §10.1.6 TypeError. §28.1.3:
- step 1 (non-object target → TypeError) — enforced with the shared
  `emitNonObjectArgGuard` (now exported), which fires for a statically primitive /
  null / undefined target (the test262 non-object subtests use bare primitive
  literals). A runtime-`any` primitive still slips through — an accepted
  imprecision shared with standalone `Object.defineProperty`.
- step 2 (ToPropertyKey) — handled inside the native via `__to_property_key`
  (#2042 S1); numeric keys coerce.
- step 3 (ToPropertyDescriptor errors) — the native already throws a catchable
  TypeError for malformed descriptors.
- step 4 (boolean result) — the applier returns the obj (always truthy); we drop
  it and return i32 `true`.

**Known limitation** (shared with standalone `Object.defineProperty`): a rejected
redefine of an existing non-configurable property silently no-ops in the native
rather than surfacing failure, so the Reflect path returns `true` where spec
wants `false`. Faithful handling needs a failure channel in
`__defineProperty_value`; out of this slice.

New tests in `tests/issue-2046.test.ts` (28/28 green): data descriptor apply,
boolean-true return, numeric-key coercion, accessor descriptor, pre-built
(dynamic) descriptor, enumerable:false hidden from for-in, primitive-target and
null-target TypeError. `tests/issue-1905.test.ts` updated — `defineProperty`
removed from the "still refuses" list (now supported), all green.

Pre-existing unrelated failures (byte-identical to origin/main, untouched here):
`tests/object-define-property.test.ts` fails to load (missing `./helpers.js`
import); `tests/equivalence/reflect-api.test.ts` "Reflect.construct creates a new
instance" fails identically on clean main (host-mode construct gap).

**Still refused (out of this PR, issue stays `in-progress`):**
- **`Reflect.construct`** (152 rows, the big one) — gated on standalone construct
  machinery (coordinate with #2158).
- **PR-C (real receiver plumbing)** — senior/deferred (#1888 Slice 5).
- `getPrototypeOf` / `setPrototypeOf` / `apply` standalone arms.

## PR-C slice — getPrototypeOf + setPrototypeOf routed (2026-06-25)

REGROUND against current main HEAD (669600612) before any change confirmed all
three §26.1 prototype/apply methods still refused in standalone (`Codegen error:
Reflect.{getPrototypeOf,setPrototypeOf,apply} not supported … #1472 Phase C`).

**Change** (`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`, inside the `if (ctx.standalone)`
Reflect dispatch block, after the `defineProperty` arm):

- **`Reflect.getPrototypeOf(target)` → native `__getPrototypeOf`** — the SAME
  helper backing standalone `Object.getPrototypeOf` (calls.ts ~5943). Returns
  `extern.convert_any($Object.$proto)` (may be null). §26.1.8 step 1 (non-object
  target → TypeError) enforced at the CALL SITE with the shared
  `emitNonObjectArgGuard` (the same static-type / bare-literal guard the
  `defineProperty` arm uses); the shared native is untouched.
- **`Reflect.setPrototypeOf(target, proto)` → native `__object_setPrototypeOf`**
  — the SAME helper backing standalone `Object.setPrototypeOf` (calls.ts ~5829),
  which performs the §10.1.2.1 OrdinarySetPrototypeOf extensibility + cycle
  checks and writes `$Object.$proto`. §26.1.14 step 1 (non-object target →
  TypeError) and step 2 (non-null primitive proto → TypeError) enforced at the
  CALL SITE; `null`/`undefined` proto is legal (passes through to the native,
  which maps a non-`$Object` proto to a null `$proto`). The proto arg goes
  through `compileProtoArg` (the #2580 M3 Stage A inline-literal reify) just like
  `Object.setPrototypeOf`. Returns i32 `true` on success.
  - **KNOWN LIMITATION** (identical to the `Reflect.defineProperty` arm above):
    `__object_setPrototypeOf` has no boolean failure channel — a *refused* set
    (non-extensible target or a proto cycle) silently no-ops and still returns
    `obj`, so the Reflect path returns the spec's `true` instead of `false` for
    those cases. Faithful handling needs a failure channel in the native; out of
    this slice (converting the common refusal→working path is the win).

**Verified** (probe + tests, both against the test262 compile path
`skipSemanticDiagnostics: true`): setProto→getProto round-trips by identity for
dynamic (`any`-typed / `Object.create`) objects; getProto of a plain object is
null; getProto identity is stable; non-object target throws (getProto and
setProto); non-null primitive proto throws; null proto is legal.

**Verified subtlety** — the setProto→getProto round-trip is only OBSERVABLE for
dynamic `$Object`s (`any`-typed / `Object.create`). Closed-struct object literals
(`var o = {}` with no `any` annotation) do NOT round-trip — but this is the
**pre-existing #2580 M3 closed-struct-vs-`$Object` substrate gap shared with
`Object.setPrototypeOf`** (the `Object.*` control shows the identical var-typed
0), NOT introduced by this routing. The test262 Reflect prototype rows use the
dynamic shape, which works.

**`Reflect.apply` stays refused** — needs CreateListFromArrayLike + a call/spread
analog with no native helper in this slice; kept its loud refusal (pinned by a
test). Out of PR-C scope.

New tests in `tests/issue-2046.test.ts` (35/35 green): getProto/setProto
round-trip identity, setProto-returns-true, getProto-via-Object.create,
plain-object-null-proto, stable-identity, null-proto-legal, four non-object /
primitive-proto TypeError guards, and the apply-still-refused pin.
`tests/issue-1905.test.ts` updated (4/4 green) — `getPrototypeOf` removed from the
"still refuses" list.

**Still refused after PR-C (issue stays `in-progress`):**
- **`Reflect.construct`** — gated on standalone construct machinery (#2158).
- **`Reflect.apply`** — needs a call/spread native analog.
- **Real receiver plumbing** (explicit-receiver get/set) — senior/deferred,
  #1888 Slice 5.

## Residual (as of #2199, PO reconcile 2026-06-28)

NOT done — multi-PR. PR-A/PR-B/PR-C landed (getPrototypeOf/setPrototypeOf routed to natives, receiver arg, ToPropertyKey, deleteProperty freeze/configurable). Remaining per the file "## Remaining (out of this PR)": accessor-invocation receiver handling, coordinated with #1888 Slice 5 accessor work. Stays in-progress.
