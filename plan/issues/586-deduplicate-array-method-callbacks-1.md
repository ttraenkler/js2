# #586 — Deduplicate array method callbacks (~1,500 lines)

## Status: in-review
`forEach`, `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `find`, `findIndex`, `some`, `every` (expressions.ts) each implement nearly identical logic:

1. Get array length
2. Loop from 0 to length
3. Extract element + coerce type
4. Call callback with (element, index, array)
5. Use return value (filter: push if truthy, map: push result, reduce: accumulate, etc.)

Steps 1-4 are identical across all 8 methods. Only step 5 differs.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done

Extracted shared helper functions to eliminate duplication across 8 callback-based array methods:

- `setupArrayCallback()` — compiles the callback argument, sets up either closure (call_ref) path or host bridge fallback
- `setupArrayLoop()` — compiles receiver, extracts vec/data/len, allocates loop locals, sets i=0
- `buildClosureCallInstrs()` / `buildBridgeCallInstrs()` — build the Wasm instructions for invoking the callback
- `buildTruthyCheck()` / `buildFalsyCheck()` — build truthiness/falsiness check instructions based on return type
- `buildCallAndCheck()` — combines call + check for convenience
- `emitArrayLoop()` / `loopExitCheck()` / `loopIncrement()` — shared loop structure

Each method (filter, map, reduce, forEach, find, findIndex, some, every) was refactored to use these helpers, keeping only their unique per-iteration logic.

### Results
- File reduced from 22,951 to 22,405 lines (net -546 lines)
- The 8 methods went from ~1,332 lines to ~786 lines (including ~250 lines of shared helpers)
- All existing tests pass with no regressions

### What worked
- Starting with the shared helper approach rather than trying to unify the loop bodies
- Keeping `reduce` separate since it has a fundamentally different callback signature (2-arg)
- Using discriminated union for `elemSource` parameter (`local` vs `inline`) to handle the two element loading patterns

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — extracted shared helpers, refactored 8 methods

## Complexity: M
