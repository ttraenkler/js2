# Issue #239: Element access on struct types (bracket notation)

## Status: done

## Summary

119 tests fail with "Element access on struct type '__anon_0'" or similar. These tests use bracket notation (`obj['prop']`, `obj[variable]`) to access properties on objects. The codegen only supports dot notation (`obj.prop`) via `struct.get`, not bracket notation.

## Root Cause

JavaScript allows both `obj.prop` and `obj['prop']` to access the same property. The Wasm codegen maps object properties to struct fields, which are accessed by field index. Dot notation is resolved at compile time to the correct field index, but bracket notation with a string literal or variable requires resolving the property name at compile time or falling back to a dynamic lookup.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- ElementAccessExpression handling
- Tests affected: ~119 compile errors

## Expected Impact

Fixing string-literal bracket access (`obj['prop']`) is straightforward and would resolve ~80 of the 119 errors. Variable bracket access (`obj[x]`) requires more complex logic.

## Suggested Approach

1. For ElementAccessExpression where the index is a string literal:
   - Look up the string value in the struct type's field map
   - Emit `struct.get` with the resolved field index
   - This is equivalent to dot notation
2. For ElementAccessExpression where the index is a numeric literal:
   - If the object is array-typed, use `array.get`
   - If struct-typed with numeric field names, resolve to field index
3. Variable-index access on structs requires hashmap fallback (#130) -- defer these cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `obj['prop']` with string literal compiles as `struct.get`
- [x] `obj[0]` on arrays compiles as `array.get`
- [x] At least 60 compile errors resolved
- [x] No regression in existing property access tests

## Complexity: M

## Implementation Summary

### What was done

Extended the bracket notation field name resolution in four codegen paths to handle additional cases beyond string/numeric literals and const variable references:

1. **`compileElementAccess`** (read path) -- replaced `resolveConstantExpression` fallback with `resolveComputedKeyExpression` (which handles enum member access like `Keys.X`) and added TypeScript checker type-based resolution for `let` variables with string/number literal types (e.g., `let key: "x" = "x"; obj[key]`).

2. **`compileElementAssignment`** (write path) -- same enhancement: enum member keys and TS checker literal type inference.

3. **`compileElementCompoundAssignment`** (compound assignment path, e.g., `obj["x"] += 1`) -- same enhancement.

4. **`compilePostfixIncrementElement`** (postfix `++`/`--` path) -- expanded from only handling `isStringLiteral` to the full resolution chain: string/numeric literals, `resolveComputedKeyExpression`, and TS checker literal type inference. Also added vec struct detection to avoid matching vec structs as plain structs.

### What worked

- Using `resolveComputedKeyExpression` to handle enum member access (already existed but was not used in element access paths)
- Using the TypeScript checker's `isStringLiteral()`/`isNumberLiteral()` on the argument type to resolve `let` variables with narrowed literal types

### What didn't apply

- Union literal types (`key: "a" | "b"`) and `Record<string, number>` (index signature types) require runtime dispatch / hashmap fallback (#130) -- deferred with skipped tests

### Files changed

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- four element access codegen paths updated
- `tests/issue-239.test.ts` -- 13 test cases (11 passing, 2 skipped for known limitations)

### Tests now passing

All 11 new bracket notation tests pass, covering: string literal keys, const variable keys, let variable keys with literal types, enum value keys, function parameter access, mixed dot/bracket notation, class instance bracket access, nested object bracket access, bracket assignment, and array numeric indexing. No regressions in existing equivalence or codegen tests.
