## Problem

34 rows under `language/statements/class/**` and `language/expressions/class/**`
are non-pass in the ES2015 standalone baseline (2026-09-29 22:47 UTC;
11,229 / 11,704). They are NOT one defect. Measured on `origin/main`
@ `2ef807a6` (2026-09-30, `flock … run-test262-paths.mts .tmp/6772/rows.txt
--isolate --standalone`, log `.tmp/6772/base-sweep.log`): **33 fail + 1
compile_error, 0 pass**. Row list: `.tmp/6772/rows.txt` (paths relative to
`test262/test/`).

Bucketed by MECHANISM (the first failing assertion, confirmed by a minimal
probe on main — probes `.tmp/6772/p*.js`, runner `.tmp/6772/probe.mts`
(standalone, `imports: []`), node oracle `.tmp/6772/oracle.mjs`, verdict
logs `.tmp/6772/probes-base*.log`):

| # | mechanism | rows | probe: main → node |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | `this` / `super.x` / `super.m()` used BEFORE `super()` returns, and a SECOND `super()` — no ReferenceError (§13.3.7.1 step 8 BindThisValue / §9.1.1.3.1); the second call must still run the parent first | `definition/this-access-restriction.js`, `definition/this-check-ordering.js`, `definition/this-access-restriction-2.js` (also G, G2) | p1 0 → 3, p2 0 → 63, p3 14 → 15 |
| B | `super(a, b)` into a ZERO-formal parent that reads `arguments`: the extras are evaluated and DROPPED (class-bodies.ts:4558-4563) instead of published through `__extras_argv` the way the `new` site does (new-super.ts:8359-8365) | `arguments/access.js` | p5e 0 → 2121 (the `new Base(1,2)` site is fine: p5d 21 = node) |
| G | §10.2.1.3 [[Construct]] step 13 return-override with a FOREIGN object (`return o` / `return {}` / `return obj = {}`): the struct-typed constructor result cannot carry it, so `new C()` yields `this` | `subclass/class-definition-null-proto-contains-return-override.js`, `subclass/derived-class-return-override-with-object.js`, `subclass/default-constructor-2.js`, (+ `this-access-restriction-2.js`) | p4 8 → 63 (all four shapes wrong), p15 15 = node (everything else in `default-constructor-2.js` already passes) |
| G2 | a class constructor invoked through `.apply` / `.call` does not throw (`C()` already does, #4483 E) | `arguments/default-constructor.js`, (+ `this-access-restriction-2.js`) | p5c 0 → 15 |
| C1 | a computed member key that is an ASSIGNMENT (`[x = 1]() {}`) is constant-folded to its RHS (literals.ts:2600-2604) and the write never runs at ClassDefinitionEvaluation | `cpn-class-{decl,expr}-computed-property-name-from-assignment-expression-assignment.js`, `cpn-class-{decl,expr}-accessors-…-assignment.js` (4) | p6 14 → 15 (only bit 1, `x === 1` after the definition, is lost) |
| C2 | ONE `var C` assigned TWO class expressions in turn: `classExprNameMap` (declarations.ts:2668) is last-wins, so every `C.prototype.<k>` resolves against the wrong class | `expressions/class/accessor-name-inst-computed-in.js` | p7d 0 → 3 (one class alone: p7 bit 1 passes) |
| D | a class EXPRESSION's METHOD writing the class's own name (`new (class C { m() { C = 42; } }).m()`) does not TypeError; ctor / class-declaration methods do (#5195 Step 9 I) | `name-binding/const.js` | p8c 1 → 3; p8a/p8b/p8d = node |
| H1 | a method literally named `new` (escaped `new` or not) registers under `${C}_new` — the ALLOCATOR's own funcMap key — so `new C()` calls the method: invalid Wasm `local.tee … expected (ref null $C), found f64` in `__module_init`, even when the method is never called | `{statements,expressions}/class/ident-name-method-def-new-escaped.js` (2) | p9, p9b, p9c: CompileError on all three |
| H2 | `static get constructor()` / `static set constructor(_)`: `C.constructor` folds to the class object instead of calling the static accessor (p10 bit 4), and passing `C.prototype.constructor`/`C.constructor` into a helper traps "illegal cast" | `{statements,expressions}/class/elements/syntax/valid/grammar-static-ctor-accessor-meth-valid.js` (2) | p10 3 → 7; p10e (harness shape) illegal cast; p10d 3 = node |
| H3 | `class D extends (calls++, C) {}`: the IR planner throws `indexed support unit …:class-implicit-constructor… has no R0 terminal owner` (planning-identity.ts:409-413) for the `calls++` node — a top-level implicit-ctor SUPPORT unit is registered with a null owner (identity.ts:1233-1241) and the heritage expression's nodes walk up into it; plus R4: `Object.getPrototypeOf(D)` must be `C` (#6767 residual R4) | `definition/side-effects-in-extends.js` (the one compile_error) | p11 COMPILE-FAIL → 15 |
| E | `class RE extends RegExp {}`: the instance IS a real `$RegExp` (new-site lowering, #6651 C5) but `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(re, 'lastIndex')` is `undefined` — also for a PLAIN `new RegExp()` (carrier gOPD arm missing; `hasOwnProperty` answers true) | `subclass/builtin-objects/RegExp/lastIndex.js` | p13d 8 → 15 |
| I | heritage that is a bound function with a `prototype` ACCESSOR: nothing evaluates `Get(superclass, "prototype")` at definition (class-heritage-check.ts is compile-time proof only and declines a `get` key), so the getter is never called and `42` never throws | `definition/prototype-getter.js` | p17 0 → 7; the carrier supports it: p17b 15 = node |
| F/R1 | static + instance accessor of the same name share ONE function slot `${C}_get_${name}` (class-bodies.ts:1839-1844 `continue`) — #6767 residual R1 | `definition/getters-restricted-ids.js`, `definition/fn-name-accessor-get.js`, `definition/fn-name-accessor-set.js` (the last two also need R3 + accessor `name`) | p12 4 → 63 (bit 1 `gOPD(A.prototype,'id')`) |
| F/R2 | `caller`/`arguments` on a method VALUE must throw (%ThrowTypeError%, §10.2.4); the typed fold exists (`function-poison-pill-access.ts`), the runtime arm does not — #6767 residual R2 | `definition/methods-restricted-properties.js`, (half of) `strict-mode/arguments-callee.js` | p12 bits 8/16, p14 0 → 3 |
| E2 | `class extends <TypedArray>` / `ArrayBuffer` / `GeneratorFunction` construct no carrier at all (`byteLength`/`length` undefined even through an untyped read); GeneratorFunction needs provider-side dynamic function construction | 9 rows — see "Deferred" | p13c 384 → 1023; p16 needs the eval provider |

Two internal errors surfaced by probes that are NOT in the 34 rows (file
separately, do not fix here): (i) two same-named block-scoped classes
extending a parent that has a METHOD → `Internal error … inherited class
callable __anonClass_C_0_method is not exact child physical key C_method`
(`program-abi-class-callable-planning.ts:602`, probe p2b); (ii) a module-level
`try { class C … }` plus a same-named class inside an IIFE → `projected local
class C carries ir-class:… instead of …` (`ir/module-bindings.ts:239`, probe
p8 first cut).

## Implementation Plan (2026-09-30, Fable lane; Opus implements)

Order: S1a → S1b → S2 → S3 (one row needs all three) → S4 … S12 in any
order (independent), S13 optional last. Everything new is gated on
`ctx.standalone` unless a step says otherwise; the host lane stays
byte-identical (verify with a `compile()` sha256 A/B on p1/p4/p9 for
`target: undefined`). Type queries go through `ctx.oracle`, never
`ctx.checker`. Every step: probe on base FIRST (`.tmp/6772/base-src` =
`git archive origin/main src`), then on the branch, then its rows.

### Step 0 — base copies and the before-state

`mkdir -p .tmp/6772 && git archive origin/main src | tar -x -C .tmp/6772/base-src`;
re-run `.tmp/6772/rows.txt` and every `.tmp/6772/p*.js` probe on the
unmodified tree (`npx tsx .tmp/6772/probe.mts .tmp/6772/p1.js …`) and keep
the logs. The QuickJS eval provider must be built for your src tree
(`node --import tsx scripts/build-quickjs-eval-provider.mjs`, seed with
`JS2WASM_QUICKJS_ARTIFACT_DIR=<any sibling worktree's .test262-cache/quickjs-artifact-*>`
to skip the 3-min cold build) — `getters-restricted-ids.js` is the only row
that needs it.

### S1a — `super(...)` publishes the extras a zero-formal `arguments` parent reads (B)

(a) Rows: `arguments/access.js`.

(b) `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts::compileSuperCall`, the `flatArgs` arm at
`:4551-4567`. Today: args beyond `paramTypes.length` are compiled and
`drop`ped (`:4558-4563`); `maybeSetArgcForKnownCall` at `:4604` publishes
`__argc` only.

(c) When `ctx.funcUsesArguments.has(parentInitName)` and
`flatArgs.length > paramTypes.length`: replace the drop loop with
`emitSetExtrasArgv(ctx, fctx, flatArgs, paramTypes.length)` (imported in
class-bodies.ts already; the `new` site's exact idiom, new-super.ts:8359-8365,
and the zero-formal runtime-spread arm two lines below at `:4583-4589`). Keep
the `evaluateArgumentForSideEffects` drop loop for parents that do NOT read
`arguments` (byte-identical). `actualArgCount` stays `flatArgs.length`.

(d) Order: extras are evaluated left-to-right after the positional args,
exactly as today. ES5 risk: `emitSetExtrasArgv` is shared with every
function call's extras protocol — do not touch its body. Pins: ES5
`language/arguments-object/**` (mapped + unmapped, every currently-passing
row) and `tests/issue-5153*.test.ts`, `tests/issue-2202*.test.ts` if present.

(e) Acceptance: p5e = 2121; `arguments/access.js` passes; p5d stays 21.

### S1b — uninitialised-`this` guard on every `this` use in a derived constructor, and a second `super()` throws AFTER running the parent (A)

(a) Rows: `definition/this-access-restriction.js`, `definition/this-check-ordering.js`;
with S2 + S3 also `definition/this-access-restriction-2.js`. Also the
ReferenceError half of `subclass/builtin-objects/GeneratorFunction/super-must-be-called.js`
(already passing; must stay so).

(b) Files. NEW leaf `src/codegen/derived-ctor-this-guard.ts` holding the
mechanism; hooks in:
- `src/codegen/expressions/new-super.ts`: `classifySuperUninitializedRead`
  (`:1710`) — generalise to `classifyUninitializedThisAccess(fctx, node)`
  (same walk, same "never/always/runtime" answers; the node may be a
  `ThisKeyword`, a `super.x`/`super[x]` reference, a `super.m()` callee, or
  a nested `super(...)` call). `ensureSuperInitializedFlagLocal` (`:1823`) —
  widen `needed`. `emitSuperInitializedFlagStore` (`:1860`) — becomes
  `emitSuperCallBindThis` (below). Move the three into the leaf; new-super.ts
  keeps re-exports or imports (line-neutral there).
- `src/codegen/expressions/this-keyword.ts::compileThisKeyword` (`:30`): after
  the inline-IIFE rung (`:40-43`) and BEFORE the typed-this / `localMap`
  rungs, call `emitUninitializedThisGuard(ctx, fctx, expr)`.
- `src/codegen/expressions/assignment.ts`: `compilePropertyAssignment` and
  `compileElementAssignment` take `this` receivers without going through
  `compileThisKeyword` (`tryEmitTypedThisFieldSet` `:4942`, the `pinnedThis`
  arm `:4948`, `tryEmitPinnedStructMemberSet`). Call the same guard once at
  the top of each when `skipTransparentExpressions(target.expression).kind ===
  ThisKeyword`. Probe `this.x = 3`, `this[k] = 3`, `this.x += 1`, `this.x++`
  (unary-updates.ts / operator-assignment.ts read `this` through
  `compileExpression` → covered by the this-keyword hook; verify).
- `src/codegen/expressions/new-super.ts::compileSuperMethodCallCore` (via
  `compileSuperMethodCall` `:1438`): guard at entry (the row's
  `super.method(); super(this)` needs the ReferenceError at the CALL, whose
  lowering has no guard today — the `:1841` comment).
- `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts:3068-3069` (statement `super(...)`) and
  `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts:8079-8080` (nested `super(...)`): replace
  `emitSuperInitializedFlagStore(fctx)` with `emitSuperCallBindThis(ctx, fctx)`.

(c) Design.
- `emitUninitializedThisGuard`: `if (!ctx.standalone || !fctx.isDerivedConstructor) return;`
  classify the node: `"never"` → nothing; `"always"` → `emitThrowReferenceError`
  (the #5350 message, `new-super.ts:1880`) and fall through to the ordinary
  lowering (dead but well-typed code); `"runtime"` →
  `local.get $__js2_super_done; i32.eqz; if { throw }` then the ordinary
  lowering (the `:1886-1894` shape). "always" already covers a `this` INSIDE
  a `super(...)` argument list: that `super()` has not ENDED before the node,
  so it is not "preceded" (§13.3.7.1 evaluates the arguments before
  BindThisValue — `super(this.x)` / `super(this)` / `super(1, 2,
  Object.getPrototypeOf(this))` all throw while evaluating the argument).
- `ensureSuperInitializedFlagLocal` allocates the flag when ANY of: (i) some
  `this`/`super`-reference/`super.m()`-callee node in the constructor frame
  classifies `"runtime"` (today: `super.x` reads only); (ii) the constructor
  frame contains MORE than one `super(...)` call node (walk with the existing
  nested-class skip; nested FUNCTIONS/arrows are descended into for the
  count but their calls cannot set the flag — record that as the xa8-style
  residual); (iii) any constructor-frame `super(...)` lies inside an
  iteration statement.
- `emitSuperCallBindThis` (after `compileSuperCall` returned — the parent
  has run, §13.3.7.1 step 6 before step 8):
  ```wasm
  ;; only when the flag local was allocated
  local.get $__js2_super_done
  if                       ;; already initialised → §9.1.1.3.1 ReferenceError
    <restore $__ctor_override from the saved local, S2>
    <emitThrowReferenceError "Must call super constructor …">
  end
  i32.const 1
  local.set $__js2_super_done
  ```
  Without the flag (a single straight-line `super()`), the store stays a
  no-op exactly as today. `this-check-ordering.js` asserts, for a second
  `super(f())` after the first `super()`: the parent ran (`baseCalled === 1`),
  `f()` ran (`fCalled === 1`), ReferenceError, and `this === obj`. The
  second call re-runs the parent `_init` on the SAME `selfLocal` (accepted
  deviation: a parent that writes fields re-initialises them; the rows in
  scope do not observe it — record). Its nested shapes follow from "every
  `super()` throws at its OWN completion once `this` is initialised":
  `super(super(), f())` → the INNER `super()` runs Base (baseCalled 1) and
  throws, so `f()` never runs (`fCalled === 0`, node agrees);
  `super(f(), super())` → `f()` runs (1), the inner `super()` runs Base (1)
  and throws. Both are the design above with no special casing. p3 pins the
  first shape; add the two nested shapes to the pin file.
- S2 interplay: when the class's ancestor chain is override-capable (S2),
  spill `global.get $__ctor_override` into a temp local before
  `compileSuperCall` and restore it in the throw arm, so a discarded second
  construction cannot replace the first call's override object
  (`this-access-restriction-2.js` `Subclass2`: `s2.prp === 3` from the first
  call).

(d) Order-preservation: `ensureSuperInitializedFlagLocal` runs before the
body loop (`class-bodies.ts:3060`) — keep it there; the Promise on-host body
(`:4104-4129`) keeps the old store (host lane). ES5 risk: none (derived
constructors only); the this-keyword hook returns immediately outside a
derived constructor — pin ES5 `language/statements/function/**` +
`language/expressions/this/**` (every currently-passing row) to prove the
early return. Class pins: `tests/issue-5350-super-property-r1.test.ts` (18),
`issue-2709`, `issue-5195-es2015-class-r2`, `issue-5195-r3-*`,
`issue-3522-super-accessor`, `issue-3024-static-super-arity`,
`issue-5309`, `issue-5312`, `issue-6767-class-definition-reflective`.

(e) Acceptance: p1 = 3, p2 = 63, p3 = 15; the two rows pass; #5350's xa/n/g
probe answers unchanged (re-run `.tmp/rev5350*/p/*.ts` if still present in
the shared `.tmp`, else the 18 pins).

### S2 — return-override channel: `new C()` yields the object a constructor returned (G)

(a) Rows: `subclass/class-definition-null-proto-contains-return-override.js`,
`subclass/derived-class-return-override-with-object.js`,
`subclass/default-constructor-2.js`; with S1b + S3 also
`definition/this-access-restriction-2.js`.

(b) Files: NEW leaf `src/codegen/ctor-return-override.ts` (pre-scan,
global, the two emitters); `src/codegen/context/types.ts` +
`create-context.ts` (`classReturnOverrideSet: Set<string>`);
`src/codegen/class-bodies.ts::collectClassDeclaration` (call the pre-scan
after the parent link is known, `:1141-1190` region);
`src/codegen/externref-backed-class-rep.ts::externrefBackedClassValType`
(`:47-54`, one arm); `src/codegen/statements/control-flow.ts` struct return
arm (`:448-542`); `src/codegen/expressions/new-super.ts` user-class `new`
site (`:8387-8408`).

(c) Design — keep the struct representation, add a side channel:
- Pre-scan `ctorMayReturnObject(decl)`: the class's OWN constructor body
  (not nested functions) contains a `return <expr>` whose `<expr>` is not
  `this`, not a literal primitive, not `undefined`/`void 0`, and not
  statically primitive per `ctx.oracle` (the flag set the arm at `:390-396`
  already uses). Mark the class in `ctx.classReturnOverrideSet`; then
  propagate to every class whose ancestor chain (`classParentMap`) contains
  a marked class (the override flows through `super()`). `class Foo extends
  null` has no `classParentMap` entry and is scanned as a base. Standalone
  only.
- One module global `$__ctor_override: externref` (null), minted on demand.
- Return arm (control-flow.ts): for `fctx.isConstructor` (NOT
  `isFnctorConstructor` — ES5 function constructors keep `#2018`/`#4464`)
  and `classReturnOverrideSet.has(resolveEnclosingClassName(fctx))`, replace
  the `ref.test`-or-`this` body at `:505-530` with:
  ```wasm
  ;; operand already compiled, coerced to externref (extern.convert_any for ref)
  local.tee $ret
  ref.is_null
  if
    ;; null / undefined-null → discard
  else
    local.get $ret  call $__typeof_object
    local.get $ret  call $__typeof_function
    i32.or
    if  local.get $ret  global.set $__ctor_override  end
  end
  local.get $self          ;; the struct is still the function's result
  ```
  (`__typeof_undefined` first when `undefined` is a distinct extern value on
  this lane — mirror `:323-377`). The `_init` twin (the `${C}_init` body is
  the same `compileReturnStatement`) is covered because `super()` calls
  `_init` directly.
- `new` site (new-super.ts, after `call finalCtorIdx` and the new.target
  restore at `:8396-8407`, before `return { kind: "ref" }`): when
  `classReturnOverrideSet.has(className)`:
  ```wasm
  local.set $tmp                 ;; (ref $C)
  global.get $__ctor_override
  ref.is_null
  if (result externref)
    local.get $tmp  extern.convert_any
  else
    global.get $__ctor_override
    ref.null.extern  global.set $__ctor_override
  end
  ```
  and return `{ kind: "externref" }`.
- `externrefBackedClassValType`: `if (ctx.classReturnOverrideSet.has(name)) return { kind: "externref" }`
  so every binding/param/field typed as such a class is an externref slot
  (the #5201 precedent; `var b = new Base(1, 2); b.prp` then reads through
  `__extern_get`, whose class-instance arm answers a struct's declared field
  — measure `b.prp`, `s2.x`, a method call `b.m()` and `b instanceof Base`
  on a NON-overridden instance of a marked class in the pin file).

(d) Order: the pre-scan must run before `resolveWasmType` is consulted for
any binding of the class (collection phase, same place `classExternrefBackedSet`
is filled). The S1b flag store's override restore depends on this global.
ES5 risk: the return arm is `fctx.isConstructor`-only and set-gated; the
type hook is name-gated; `new` site is set-gated — no ES5 program has a
class. Pins anyway (the arms sit in shared functions): ES5
`language/expressions/new/**`, `language/statements/function/13.2.2-*`
(construct return semantics), `built-ins/Function/**` currently-passing
rows; class pins as S1b plus `tests/issue-2018*.test.ts`, `issue-4450*`,
`issue-5201*`.

(e) Acceptance: p4 = 63; the three rows pass; p15 stays 15; host-lane bytes
of p4 unchanged. Residual to record: a DERIVED constructor's `this` after a
`super()` whose parent overrode is not re-bound (§9.1.1.3.1 on the derived
frame) — `this.x` after such a `super()` writes the discarded struct.

### S3 — class constructors invoked through `call` / `apply` throw (G2)

(a) Rows: `arguments/default-constructor.js`; with S1b + S2
`definition/this-access-restriction-2.js`.

(b) NEW leaf `src/codegen/class-ctor-call-apply.ts`; export
`sourceClassForCallee` from `class-call-without-new.ts:44` (currently
module-private); hook in `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts::compileCallExpression`
immediately before the existing `X.call(…)`/`X.apply(…)` lowering (grep
`=== "apply"` in calls.ts; place the hook where `tryEmitClassConstructorCallWithoutNew`
is called and mirror its position for the member-call shape).

(c) Design: callee `<expr>.call(...)` / `<expr>.apply(...)` /
`<expr>.bind(...)()`-free shapes where `sourceClassForCallee(ctx, <expr>)`
resolves (a class of THIS program; ambient classes decline — the whole
correctness story of that file). Evaluate `<expr>`, then each argument
(§13.3.6.1 order), drop, `emitThrowTypeError("Class constructor X cannot be
invoked without 'new'")`, push `ref.null.extern`, return externref — the
#4483 E shape verbatim. `Reflect.apply(C, …)` / `Function.prototype.call.call(C, …)`
reach the dynamic closure-apply terminal: if `__is_class_object`
(object-get-prototype-of.ts:575 names it as a separate identity ladder) is
reachable from `__apply_closure`'s callee classification, add a throw arm
there too; otherwise record.

(d) ES5 risk: the hook declines every non-class callee before compiling
anything (pure AST test) — pin ES5 `built-ins/Function/prototype/{call,apply}/**`
and `language/expressions/call/**` currently-passing rows.

(e) Acceptance: p5c = 15; `arguments/default-constructor.js` passes; with
S1b+S2, `this-access-restriction-2.js` passes (its `Base.call(new Object(), 1, 2)`
and `Subclass.call(…)` both take this arm).

### S4 — a member named `new` / `init` must not take the allocator's funcMap key (H1)

(a) Rows: `statements/class/ident-name-method-def-new-escaped.js`,
`expressions/class/ident-name-method-def-new-escaped.js`.

(b) `src/codegen/class-member-keys.ts::classMemberFuncKey` (`:47-70`). The
allocator registers `${className}_new` with `kind === undefined`
(new-super.ts:4608/4993/8387); methods register with `kind` set
(class-bodies.ts:1685/1800/3218).

(c) Add, before the `topLevelFunctionNames` rule: when `kind !== undefined`
and `fullName` ends in `_new` or `_init` and the prefix names a class
(`ctx.classSet.has(prefix)` — the class is in the set before its members
are minted; verify), relocate: `key = \`__cm$member$${fullName}\``. Both
producer (registration) and every consumer already route through this
helper with the same `kind` (#1983 contract), so no other site changes.
TS cooks `new` to `"new"` (`member.name.text`), so one rule covers
both spellings — probe p9 AND p9b.

(d) Residual: the inheritance loop (class-bodies.ts:1957) skips suffix
`new`/`init`, so a subclass does not inherit a method named `new` — record.
ES5 risk: none (class members only); pin `tests/issue-1983*.test.ts`.

(e) Acceptance: p9 = 42, p9b = 42, p9c = 7; both rows pass.

### S5 — a FOLDED computed key still runs its assignment at ClassDefinitionEvaluation (C1)

(a) Rows: the four `cpn-class-*-computed-property-name-from-assignment-expression-assignment.js`.

(b) `src/codegen/statements/nested-declarations.ts::emitUnresolvedComputedAccessorNameEffects`
(`:456-485`; both class-declaration call sites `:614`/`:673` and the
class-expression route in new-super.ts already call it, in member order).

(c) The `continue` at `:464-473` skips a member whose key
`resolveComputedKeyExpression` folds. Add a second arm: the key folds AND
`ts.isBinaryExpression(e) && e.operatorToken.kind === EqualsToken` (the
literals.ts:2600-2604 fold arm; also cover `++`/`--` and call expressions if
`resolveConstantExpression` ever folds them — it does not today) →
`compileExpression(ctx, fctx, member.name.expression)` and `drop` (no
`__cmkey_` global write: the folded name is still the property key). Keep
the members' relative order (one loop). This emitter runs on every lane, so
host bytes move for exactly these shapes — spec-correct; note it.

(d) ES5 risk: none (computed class keys are ES2015; object-literal computed
keys take a different emitter — do not touch literals.ts). Pins:
`tests/issue-5195*` (Step 1 computed keys), `issue-5318-r4/r5`.

(e) Acceptance: p6 = 15; four rows pass.

### S6 — heritage-clause nodes are owned by the enclosing scope, and `Object.getPrototypeOf(D)` is the parent class (H3 + R4)

(a) Rows: `definition/side-effects-in-extends.js`.

(b) `src/ir/planning-identity.ts::requireIrPlanningOwnerUnitId` (`:392-419`);
`src/codegen/expressions/object-get-prototype-of.ts` next to
`tryEmitStandaloneBaseClassGetPrototypeOf` (`:272-291`) and its call at
`:339-342`.

(c) IR: in the parent walk, when the matched `unit.kind ===
"class-implicit-constructor"` has `terminalOwnerId === null` (the top-level
support unit, identity.ts:1233-1241) and `node` lies inside the class
declaration's `heritageClauses` (`current` is the ClassLikeDeclaration and
`node.pos` is within a heritage clause's range) → `continue` the walk: the
heritage expression is evaluated in the ENCLOSING scope, never in the
constructor. Do not change the inventory (a null owner is deliberate for a
support unit). R4: add `tryEmitStandaloneDerivedClassGetPrototypeOf`: arg0 an
identifier naming a class with `ctx.classParentMap.get(name)` a USER class
(`ctx.classSet.has(parent)`) → compile arg0 for side effects (drop), then
`emitLazyClassObjectGet(ctx, fctx, parent)` (extern.ts:449, pushes the class
object; `extern.convert_any` if it is a ref) → externref. A builtin parent
answers the builtin constructor value only if `emitBuiltinConstructorIdentity`
has it; otherwise decline (record). Standalone-only; call it right after the
base-class helper at `:341`.

(d) ES5 risk: the IR walk change is keyed on a class-only unit kind — pin
`pnpm run check:ir-fallbacks` (no bucket may grow) and `tests/ir-*.test.ts`;
the fold is class-gated — pin ES5 `built-ins/Object/getPrototypeOf/**`.

(e) Acceptance: p11 = 15; the row passes; `#6767`'s q3 probe
(`Object.getPrototypeOf(D)` for a derived D) now answers the parent — update
the RESIDUAL pin in `tests/issue-6767-class-definition-reflective.test.ts`
to the fixed expectation.

### S7 — a binding assigned more than one class expression resolves dynamically (C2)

(a) Rows: `expressions/class/accessor-name-inst-computed-in.js`.

(b) `src/codegen/declarations.ts` `:2655-2670` (assignment-RHS class
expressions) and the var-name bridge near `:2798-2810`; `context/types.ts`
(`classExprAmbiguousNames: Set<string>`).

(c) At `:2664-2669`: if `ctx.classExprNameMap.get(nameHint)` already maps to
a DIFFERENT synthetic name (or the name is in `classExprAmbiguousNames`),
delete the entry and add the name to the set; guard both `set` sites with
the set. A read `C.prototype.<k>` / `new C()` for an ambiguous `C` then takes
the runtime path (`C` is an externref holding the class object; `__extern_get(C,
"prototype")` answers the prototype `$Object` (#5195/#6767 view) and the
runtime-keyed accessor is reached through its `__cmkey_` global). Measure —
if the dynamic `new C()` path declines for a class-object value, name the
arm (`__native_construct_<N>`, #3981) and record.

(d) ES5 risk: none. Pins: `tests/issue-5318-r4-computed-accessor-keys.test.ts`,
`issue-5383-class-value-dynamic-call`, `issue-4770-class-name-descriptor`.

(e) Acceptance: p7d = 3; the row passes; p7 stays 1-bit-passing.

### S8 — a class-expression METHOD writing the class's own name is a TypeError (D)

(a) Rows: `name-binding/const.js`.

(b) First determine the route: p8c's method (`new (class C { m() { C = 42; } }).m()`)
— run with `trackFallbacks`/`JS2WASM_IR_TRACE` (see `src/ir/select.ts` and
`plan/log/ir-adoption.md`) to learn whether the method body is IR-compiled.
`isConstIdentifierAssignmentTarget` (`expressions/helpers.ts:80-119`) already
answers `true` for this write, so the legacy path throws; the miss is either
(i) the IR lowering of identifier assignment (no class-name-immutable rule),
or (ii) the legacy identifier-write arm for a name that has NO slot in the
method's frame (`identifier-assignment.ts::resolveModuleAwareIdentifierWriteTarget`
region) not consulting `tryConstSet`.

(c) For (i): the smallest correct change is a SELECTOR decline in
`src/ir/select.ts` for a class member whose body assigns the enclosing class
expression's own name (a `writeIsInsideOwnClassBody`-style lexical test) —
the legacy path then throws; record the IR-lowering gap. For (ii): call
`tryConstSet` before that arm. Either way the throw must follow RHS
evaluation (§13.15.2).

(d) ES5 risk: (ii) touches the shared identifier-write path — pin ES5
`language/expressions/assignment/**`, `language/identifier-resolution/**`,
`language/statements/variable/**` currently-passing rows; (i) pin
`check:ir-fallbacks` (the `body-shape-rejected`-style bucket may grow by
exactly this shape — grant it in `scripts/ir-fallback-baseline.json` only via
`pnpm run check:ir-fallbacks -- --update` with the reason in the commit).

(e) Acceptance: p8c = 3; p8a/p8b/p8d unchanged; the row passes.

### S9 — a static accessor named `constructor` wins over the class-object `.constructor` fold (H2)

(a) Rows: `statements/class/elements/syntax/valid/grammar-static-ctor-accessor-meth-valid.js`,
`expressions/class/elements/syntax/valid/grammar-static-ctor-accessor-meth-valid.js`.

(b) `src/codegen/property-access-dispatch.ts` class-object `.constructor`
arms: `emitClassStaticMemberRead` (`:2299`) at `:2359`
(`propName === "constructor" && !ctx.staticMethodSet.has(fullName)`) and
`finalizeStructAndDynamicMemberGet` (`:4238`) at `:4450`
(`ctx.classSet.has(typeName)`). The `:547` arm inside
`tryConstructorPrototypeIdentity` is the AMBIENT-builtin identity fold and is
not touched.

(c) Add `&& !ctx.staticAccessorSet.has(\`${className}_constructor\`)` to both
so the ordinary static-accessor read (`C.sx`, #6767 p11) runs and `C.constructor`
answers the getter's value (`undefined` in the row). Then re-measure p10e
(`notSame(C.prototype.constructor, C.constructor)` through an untyped
2-parameter helper — the harness `assert.notSameValue` shape): if the
"illegal cast" persists it is the #6767 (b) family (call-site parameter
inference narrowing a `<Class>.prototype.constructor` argument to `$C`);
extend the withdrawal predicate in `class-proto-object.ts` (consumed by
`declarations/param-return-inference.ts`) to that spelling.

(d) ES5 risk: the standalone `.constructor` arms are shared with every
receiver — the added condition only narrows a CLASS-object arm. Pin ES5
`built-ins/Object/prototype/constructor/**`, `built-ins/Function/prototype/constructor/**`
and every ES5 `**/prototype/constructor/**` row currently passing; class
pins `tests/issue-5195-r3-restricted-properties.test.ts`,
`issue-6767-class-definition-reflective`.

(e) Acceptance: p10 = 7, p10c (harness form) = 7 without a trap; both rows pass.

### S10 — `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(<RegExp>, "lastIndex")` (E, RegExp)

(a) Rows: `subclass/builtin-objects/RegExp/lastIndex.js`.

(b) `src/codegen/object-runtime-descriptors.ts` — the
`__getOwnPropertyDescriptor` carrier ladder (grep `__create_descriptor`
callers and the `$RegExp` `ref.test` arm `__hasOwnProperty` uses to answer
`true` for `lastIndex`, p13d bit 8; mirror that arm).

(c) When the receiver is a `$RegExp` carrier and the key is `"lastIndex"`:
`__create_descriptor(<lastIndex field as externref>, FLAG_WRITABLE)` —
§22.2.7.1: writable, non-enumerable, non-configurable. Dynamic key only
(the row calls `verifyProperty`, a helper with runtime receiver AND key).
`verifyProperty` also WRITES and DELETES to check the attributes — the
existing `lastIndex` [[Set]] on the carrier must honour the write
(`re.lastIndex = v` already works: `built-ins/RegExp/prototype/exec/**`
pass) and `delete re.lastIndex` must answer `false` (non-configurable); probe
both. Cross-reference #6770 (Object/Reflect residue, planned in parallel;
not published at plan time) — if it lands a general native-carrier gOPD
ladder first, put the arm there instead of duplicating.

(d) ES5 risk: `__getOwnPropertyDescriptor` is ES5-critical — pin every
currently-passing ES5 row under `built-ins/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor/**`
(15.2.3.3-*) and `built-ins/RegExp/**` (S15.10.*), plus
`tests/issue-4491*`, `issue-4098*`.

(e) Acceptance: p13d = 15; the row passes.

### S11 — a runtime heritage's `prototype` is read (once) at definition, with the §15.7.14 5.h check (I)

(a) Rows: `definition/prototype-getter.js`.

(b) NEW leaf `src/codegen/class-heritage-runtime-get.ts`; callers: the three
`emitStandaloneHeritageCheck` sites (`statements/variables.ts:62` import
site, `statements/nested-declarations.ts:59`, `expressions/new-super.ts:162`
— one line after each existing call). `class-heritage-check.ts` itself is
NOT edited (compile-time proof only — its F1 rule; `:482-486` documents that
in standalone nothing else evaluates a runtime heritage today).

(c) For a standalone class whose heritage `heritageExpressionNeedingRuntimeCheck`
declines, that is not `null`, not a resolved local class, not a builtin in
`classBuiltinParentMap`, not a linked-provider parent
(`classLinkedDynamicParentExpr`), i.e. exactly the
`classDynamicUnresolvedHeritageSet` members: compile the heritage expression
ONCE → `$v`; `__typeof_function($v)` else throw TypeError "Class extends
value is not a constructor or null" (IsCallable approximates IsConstructor —
an arrow heritage is not caught; record); `__extern_get($v, "prototype")` →
`$p` (the carrier supports accessor properties on a bound function, p17b);
`if $p is not null AND not (__typeof_object | __typeof_function) → throw
TypeError "Class extends value does not have valid prototype property"`
(message twin of class-heritage-check.ts:507). Stack-neutral; no prototype
link is created (the class stays a root struct, as today). Use
`withSpeculativeCompile` exactly as `emitStandaloneHeritageCheck` does so a
declined compile rolls back.

(d) Order: evaluate BEFORE the class binding is initialised (the check
throws before `C` exists). ES5 risk: none. Pins:
`tests/issue-5195-r3-heritage-check.test.ts`, `issue-6767` step-3 cases
(their heritages are PROVABLE and must keep taking the proof, not this arm —
assert bytes unchanged for `constructable-but-no-prototype.js`'s shape),
`issue-6640*`/`issue-6644*` (linked parents must decline here).

(e) Acceptance: p17 = 7; the row passes.

### S12 — static and instance accessors of one name get distinct function slots (F/R1)

(a) Rows: `definition/getters-restricted-ids.js` (expected to flip);
`definition/fn-name-accessor-get.js`, `definition/fn-name-accessor-set.js`
(measured — they additionally need the runtime-keyed static view, #6767 R3,
and `verifyProperty(getter, 'name', …)` on accessor closures whose names
are `"get id"` / `"get "` / `"get [test262]"`; name the first failing
assertion after this step).

(b) NEW leaf `src/codegen/class-static-accessor-keys.ts` (the key helper +
the instance-accessor name set); `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts` pre-population
loop `:1640-1650` (add non-static accessor func names to
`ctx.classInstanceAccessorFuncNames`), registration `:1839-1844` /
`:1882-1884` and the emit twins `:3688` / `:3803` (pass the kind);
`src/codegen/class-member-keys.ts::classMemberFuncKey` (`:64-66`): extend
the static-relocation condition to `ctx.classMethodSet.has(fullName) ||
ctx.classInstanceAccessorFuncNames.has(fullName)` so `C_get_eval` (static)
relocates to `__cm$static$C_get_eval` when the instance getter exists.

(c) Consumers — every STATIC accessor read/write/compound/update site that
looks the getter/setter up in `funcMap` must pass `"static"` to
`classMemberFuncKey`; the audit list is the 20 `staticAccessorSet.has` sites
across 13 files (property-access-dispatch.ts ×3, declarations.ts ×4,
assignment.ts ×2, call-builtin-static.ts ×2, class-proto-accessors.ts,
extern.ts, member-get-dispatch.ts, index.ts, object-runtime.ts,
regexp-legacy-static.ts, class-static-metadata.ts, property-access.ts,
class-static-descriptor.ts) plus `class-static-sidecar.ts`'s halves. The
INSTANCE key stays byte-identical (`C_get_eval`), which is what keeps every
class without the collision unchanged. The `#1983` `continue` guards at
`:1844`/`:1884` then no longer skip the second declaration.

(d) Residual: the inheritance loop (`:1948-1975`) strips only `__cm$`, so a
relocated static accessor is not aliased into a subclass (same as the
existing `__cm$static$` method relocation — record). ES5 risk: none. Pins:
`tests/issue-6767-class-definition-reflective.test.ts` (flip its R1
RESIDUAL pin), `issue-5318-r4/r5`, `issue-5195-r3-restricted-properties`,
`issue-4455`, `issue-5151-map-size-descriptor`.

(e) Acceptance: p12 bit 1 set (and bit 2 if the accessor `name` is
`"get id"`); `getters-restricted-ids.js` passes (`C.eval === 3`,
`C.arguments === 4`); the fn-name rows measured and recorded.

### S13 (optional, last) — runtime %ThrowTypeError% for `caller` / `arguments` on closure carriers (F/R2)

Rows: `definition/methods-restricted-properties.js` (8 of its 12 assertions
read the accessors off `gOPD(...).get/.set` VALUES, so only a runtime arm
closes it) and half of `strict-mode/arguments-callee.js`. Needs a
per-carrier "restricted" bit the closure struct does not carry today
(`function-poison-pill.ts` threads strictness per CALL, not per value), so:
append an `i32 flags` field to the closure struct (append-only, every
`struct.new` of it pushes the constant — the #6766 `$Object` field-append
precedent, whose byte-identity note applies) set at closure creation for
methods, accessors, arrows, generators, class bodies and strict functions
(`isStrictFunction` + `poisonMember`'s predicate), then a `__extern_get` /
`__extern_set` arm: closure carrier ∧ flag ∧ key ∈ {caller, arguments} →
TypeError. Sloppy ordinary functions keep today's answer (their own
`caller`/`arguments` are implementation-defined; test262 does not assert
them). Do this only if the S1–S12 controls are green with budget left;
otherwise record it as its own issue. ES5 pins if attempted: every
currently-passing ES5 row under `built-ins/Function/**` and
`language/function-code/**` (the strict `caller` rows, 15.3.5.4_2-*).

### Deferred — not realistically fixable in this slice (9 rows), with the reason

| row | reason | where it belongs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `subclass/builtin-objects/GeneratorFunction/{regular-subclassing,instance-length,instance-name,instance-prototype,super-must-be-called}.js` (5) | `new GFn('a', 'yield a')` is CreateDynamicFunction through the QuickJS eval provider with a SUBCLASS NewTarget (prototype from `GFn.prototype`); the heritage is a runtime value (`Object.getPrototypeOf(function*(){}).constructor`), so it needs the linked-provider construct driver (#6640) generalised to the eval provider plus a generator-function carrier whose `length`/`name`/`prototype` are own reflective properties; the ReferenceError half of `super-must-be-called.js` already passes | a runtime-eval / provider-construct issue; cross-ref #6640, #4238 |
| `subclass/builtin-objects/TypedArray/regular-subclassing.js` | heritage is a function PARAMETER (`testWithTypedArrayConstructors(function(Constructor) { class Typed extends Constructor {} })`); the #6644/S66 identifier-parameter arm is link-consumer-only and the TA carrier work is #6769's (PR open) | measure after #6769 lands; then the dynamic-heritage construct driver for non-linked modules |
| `subclass/builtins.js` | `class ExtendedUint8Array extends Uint8Array { constructor(){ super(10); this[0] = 255; … } }`: `super(10)` builds the #3972 IDENTITY carrier (p13c: `length` undefined), and `this[i] = v` on a TA-subclass-typed receiver needs TA element dispatch — #6769's substrate | #6769 follow-up |
| `subclass/builtin-objects/ArrayBuffer/regular-subclassing.js` | same identity carrier (`byteLength` undefined even untyped, p13c bits 1/2), AND `sliced instanceof AB` needs the native `slice` to honour `constructor[@@species]` (#6769's `ctors/no-species` residual) | #6769 follow-up: add `ArrayBuffer` to `NEW_SITE_BUILTIN_PARENTS` + `NEW_SITE_ROUTED_PARENTS`, then species |
| `strict-mode/arguments-callee.js` | three mechanisms: the heritage FUNCTION EXPRESSION is never called by `super()` in standalone (compileSuperCall `:4484-4503` only calls a NAMED fnctor; an anonymous heritage function falls to `:4508`), so its `arguments.callee` poison never fires; `Object.getPrototypeOf(D)` for a fnctor parent (S6 covers user-class parents only); and R2 (S13) for `.arguments` on the function value | after S13; file the heritage-function-expression hoist separately |

`definition/methods-restricted-properties.js` is S13 (optional) — counted as
deferred unless S13 lands.

Expected after S1–S12: **22 rows flip** (S1a 1, S1b 2, S2 3, S3 1, S1b+S2+S3
1, S4 2, S5 4, S6 1, S7 1, S8 1, S9 2, S10 1, S11 1, S12 1) plus up to 2
more (`fn-name-accessor-*`) if their remaining assertions clear; 9–10 stay
red by construction of this slice.

### Overlaps found (cross-reference, do not re-plan)

- **#6767** (merged): its residuals R1 (S12), R2 (S13), R3 (runtime-keyed
  static view — not planned here), R4 (S6's fold) and its "recorded only"
  rows (`this-access-restriction{,-2}.js`, `this-check-ordering.js`,
  `side-effects-in-extends.js`, `prototype-getter.js`) are THIS issue's S1b,
  S6, S11. Its param-inference withdrawal (`param-return-inference.ts` /
  `class-proto-object.ts`) is the twin S9 may need.
- **#5350** (in-progress): S1b generalises its `__js2_super_done` flag
  (r3 S1) from `super.x` reads to `this`/`super.m()`/second-`super()`; its
  18 pins are S1b's regression floor. Do not touch `compileStandaloneSuperPropertyRead`.
- **#6769** (TypedArray, PR open on `issue-6769-typedarray-residue`): owns no
  `language/statements/class` row, but the three TA/ArrayBuffer rows above
  sit on its carrier work — deferred behind it.
- **#6766** (Proxy as prototype, in-progress): no row overlap; S10's gOPD
  arm must not touch its `$Object.$proto` walkers.
- **#6770 / #6771** (Object-Reflect / Array, planned in parallel; neither
  published at plan time — neither issue file exists on main or on any
  worktree at 2026-09-30 20:15 UTC): S10 (a native-carrier gOPD arm)
  and S9 (the `.constructor` fold) are the two places to coordinate; check
  again before starting either.
- `pre-dispatch-gate.mjs 6772` at plan time: CAUTION (no `gh` reachable;
  no claim on the ledger; no idiom-sharing issue found by hand — the closest
  is #5318's computed-property-name work, already landed).

## Acceptance criteria

- The 22 rows named per step pass on standalone, `--isolate`, on the branch
  with `origin/main` merged in; the 9 deferred rows are re-measured and
  listed with their first failing assertion.
- Every probe in `.tmp/6772/` answers the node oracle on the branch (p1 3,
  p2 63, p3 15, p4 63, p5c 15, p5e 2121, p6 15, p7d 3, p8c 3, p9/p9b 42,
  p9c 7, p10 7, p10c 7, p11 15, p12 ≥ 7 (bits 1,2,4), p13d 15, p17 7); the
  pin file `tests/issue-6772-class-residue.test.ts` carries each as a
  "RED on base" case (base verdict recorded) plus guards: a plain derived
  class with one `super()` (bytes identical to base), a non-overriding
  instance of an S2-marked class (`b.m()`, `b.x`, `b instanceof Base`), and
  a class with distinct static/instance accessor names (bytes identical).

## Lane protocol

- Worktree under `/home/user/js2/.claude/worktrees/` (branch
  `issue-6772-class-residue` from `origin/main`); symlink `node_modules` and
  `test262` if the hook does not provision them; never edit `/home/user/js2`.
- Every `run-test262-paths.mts` invocation through
  `flock /tmp/claude-0/t262.lock …` (4 shared cores). Rebuild the QuickJS
  adapter after a `src/` change when a row reports "provider is not built".
- NEW `src/` files must be registered in `scripts/compiler-boundaries.json`
  (textual insert next to their siblings; entry shape `{ "path": …,
  "state": "unmigrated", "layer": "mixed-needs-split", "destination":
  "backend-wasmgc", "owner": "3518-coordinator", "nextBoundary": … }`), then
  `node scripts/check-compiler-boundaries.mjs --mode inventory --base origin/main`.
- Gate chain, bare, exit codes read directly:
  `LOC_GATE_BASE=$(git rev-parse origin/main) node scripts/check-loc-budget.mjs && LOC_GATE_BASE=$(git rev-parse origin/main) node scripts/check-func-budget.mjs && node scripts/check-coercion-sites.mjs && npm run -s check:oracle-ratchet && npm run -s check:dead-exports && node scripts/check-compiler-boundaries.mjs --mode inventory --base origin/main && npm run -s typecheck`
  (also `pnpm run check:ir-fallbacks` for S6/S8). `check:dead-exports`
  leaves ~80 MB in `.tmp/core-node-execution-*` — delete it after.
- Vitest pins: `VITEST_FORK_MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE=1024` (CI's value) for the
  pin file and the named neighbour suites, ≤3 files per batch. Pushes:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 VITEST_FORK_MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE=4096 git push -u origin <branch>`
  (the pre-push #3765 vitest OOMs at the default 512 MB fork heap).
- Commits: `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Thomas Tränkler" GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="git@thomas.traenkler.com"`
  (the commit-msg hook blocks a Claude author), committer Claude, subject
  ending in ` ✓` (pre-commit checklist sign-off hook), trailers
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`,
  `Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_01FEGi3DmyPRPD5dx4kWU8hs`,
  `Model: Claude Opus 5.5 High`; one commit per step with its measurement in
  the body; never `--no-verify`; no `git stash` (A/B by file copy from
  `.tmp/6772/base-src`). Push early; do NOT open a PR — the lead verifies
  the pushed head and opens it.

### 2026-09-30 — #6772 implementation (Opus)

Running record, one entry per step (the commit body carries the full
measurement). Base for "base" values: `origin/main` @ `e303c5c794` unless an
entry names another; probes `.tmp/6772/*.js` (standalone, `imports: []`),
node oracle `.tmp/6772/oracle.mjs`; rows `--isolate --standalone` under the
shared lock.

| S13 | (not attempted) | optional per the plan; skipped under the lead's token-budget instruction — `methods-restricted-properties.js` stays red (follow-up: per-closure restricted bit + `__extern_get`/`__extern_set` %ThrowTypeError% arm) | — |

S2 design note (deviates from the plan's "set only on an object return"):
`$__ctor_override` is a RETURN REGISTER written on EVERY exit of a marked
`_init`, so a stale value from an unrelated construction can never be read;
it is consumed only right after a call into a marked `_init`. A derived frame
whose parent is marked keeps the parent's answer in a frame local saved AFTER
BindThisValue (a second, throwing `super()` cannot replace it), and its
`this` / data-member reads use that object. `this-access-restriction-2.js`
passes at S2 already: a marked class's `.call` reaches the dynamic [[Call]]
TypeError (probe g17: base 200 -> 3, node 3); S3 covers unmarked classes.
S2 residuals (pinned `RESIDUAL`): declared-METHOD reads/calls on a foreign
override object resolve against the class (g3 13, node 31); in a derived
frame after an overriding `super()`, `this.m()` throws from the nominal
receiver guard and `this.x = v` writes the discarded struct (g12b 10011,
node 15); dynamic construct sites (`Reflect.construct`, class values) do not
read the register; a child collected before its parent is not retro-marked.

S3 note: the arm sits in `compileCallExpression`'s `call`/`apply` block right
after the two #4076/#5143 brand-throw arms, standalone-only, and declines when
the class chain (source classes only) declares a STATIC member of that name
(`static call() {}` wins — guard s3b) or the callee may be replaced by runtime
eval. `Function.prototype.call.call(C, {})` (s3a) is reshaped to `C.call({})`
before reaching it, so it now throws instead of crashing in `eval-source.ts`.
Residuals (pinned): `Reflect.apply(C, …)` does not throw (s3c 100, node 1 —
the dynamic closure-apply terminal has no class identity arm); `apply`'s
CreateListFromArrayLike on the argument array is not performed.

S4 note: `classMemberFuncKey` relocates a MEMBER (any caller that passes a
`kind`) whose legacy name is `<C>_new` / `<C>_init` for a class of this program
to `__cm$member$<C>_new`; the allocator / `_init` lookups pass no kind and keep
the bare key. Every member-lookup consumer that used to pass no kind now passes
`"instance"` (identical key for every other name): the receiver-call ladder's
own-shadow lookups, the tail-dispatch arms, the method-value reads
(member-get / property-access / property-access-dispatch), the prototype-object
and subclass method installs, the forward-class ABI finalizer, and the IR
class projection (`projectClassCallableTarget` for `*-method` units and
`memberFunc` in ir/integration.ts — the typed probe t9 is IR-claimed and failed
there on base). Not standalone-gated (the key is lane-independent): host bytes
of p1/p3/p4/g13/t2/p6/p12 are identical to the pre-S4 merged tree, p9/p9f
change (they were invalid Wasm). The plan's inheritance residual does not
occur: s4i (a subclass calling an inherited `new()` / `init()`) answers 3 on
base and branch.

S5 note: two halves. (1) `emitUnresolvedComputedAccessorNameEffects` keeps
skipping a member whose key folds, unless the key contains a plain assignment
(`computedKeyHasAssignment`, class-member-keys.ts — the literals.ts fold reads
through `x = v`); that key is compiled for effect and dropped, in member order,
and the folded name stays the property key. (2) The emitter never ran for a
TOP-LEVEL class whose keys all fold: the module-init collector routes a class
through `compileNestedClassDeclaration` only when
`classHasUnresolvedComputedMemberName` holds. `classHasComputedKeyAssignment`
now joins that gate for declarations and for `let C = class {…}` bindings
(declarations.ts). Lane-independent: host bytes move for exactly these shapes
(p6 sha changed; p1/p3/p4/p9/p9f/g13/t2/p11/p12 identical to S4). Separate
defect found, NOT fixed here (file it): an element-access KEY that folds drops
its write the same way — `o[x = 'a']`, `c[x = 1]`, `c[String(x = 'm')]()` leave
`x` unchanged on every lane (probe p6c 2, node 15). The rows pass anyway because
the class definition performs the write first. Neighbour suites
issue-5195-es2015-class-r2 / issue-5195-r3-review / issue-5318-r4: the same 6
cases fail on the pre-S5 tree AND on origin/main a895598841 (5 stale RESIDUAL
pins whose writes/compiles now succeed — w1 987 on main — and r3-review F1,
which throws on main too: f1 150 on main and branch); issue-5318-r5 /
issue-5195-r3-heritage-check 46/46.

S6 note: three parts. (1) IR planning (`requireIrPlanningOwnerUnitId`): a
node inside a class's HERITAGE clause, reaching the class node that keys a
top-level class's null-owner `class-implicit-constructor` support unit,
continues the walk to the enclosing owner — the heritage is evaluated in the
enclosing scope, never in the constructor (all lanes; it used to throw the
`unowned-planning-owner` invariant, so no previously-compiling program can
observe the change). (2) New leaf `class-heritage-comma.ts`: on standalone /
WASI, `collectClassDeclaration` peels `extends (e1, …, C)` to its identifier
tail, so `C` is linked exactly as for `extends C`; the leading operands are
evaluated, once and in order, at each ClassDefinitionEvaluation site right
after the #5195 r3-5 heritage check (which declines a comma heritage, so
nothing runs twice), and the module-init collector routes such a top-level
class / class-expression binding through `compileNestedClassDeclaration`. The
host lane keeps its dynamic-parent registration (p11 host 3, p11c/p11d host
bytes identical). (3) R4: `Object.getPrototypeOf(D)` for a derived class
spelled by an unwritten binding answers the parent's class object when the
heritage identifier is bound, uniquely and unwritten, to that parent's own
declaration (`heritageBindsParentClass`); a parameter heritage or a rewritten
binding declines to the old fold (p11e, pinned). #6767's R4 RESIDUAL pin
flipped to the fixed expectation. `check:ir-fallbacks` unchanged. Unrelated
pre-existing defect seen while probing (not fixed): a heterogeneous array
literal returned from a function loses its number elements (`[true, 7, 1]`,
p11h bit 8, base and branch).

Merge 2026-10-02 (origin/main `ce6631272c`, #6771/#6773/#6774/#6775 and
#6797's gates): three import-only conflicts, both sides kept. #6797's two
new gates failed on the plain merge — `src/codegen/*.ts` 829 -> 833 and the
largest import SCC 697 -> 702 (the four leaves plus
`externref-backed-class-rep.ts`, which imports `ctor-return-override`). Fix
(no baseline edit): the leaves moved to `src/codegen/classes/`, and the SCC
helpers they call (`classIdentityFromExpression`,
`compileObjectLiteralAsExternref`, `sourceClassForCallee`,
`runtimeEvalMayReplaceCallee`, `unwrapCallee`,
`bindingIsUniqueAndNeverWritten`) go through `helpers/core-delegates.ts`,
registered by `expressions.ts`; the throws use the existing
`buildThrowJsErrorInstrs` delegate and the late imports the `shared.ts`
twins. Gates after: SCC 697, flat 829/829, all others green. S6 re-checked on
the merged tree (not by the earlier run): p11 15, p11b 1015, p11c 15, p11d
1023, p11g 15, p11e 0 — as recorded; `side-effects-in-extends.js` passes;
pin file 34/34 at fork heap 1024. Plan prose below still names the old flat
paths; the S11/S12 leaves go under `classes/` too.

S7 note: `ctx.classExprAmbiguousNames` (context/types.ts) — the assignment-RHS
collector (declarations.ts) deletes the `classExprNameMap` entry and marks
the name when a SECOND, different class expression is assigned to it; the
#1394 var-name bridge no longer re-adds a marked name. Reads then take the
untyped dynamic path, which already resolves the right prototype accessor.
Not standalone-gated (the map is lane-independent): host answers for
p7d / s7/a / s7/b / s7/c are identical on main `ce6631272c` and the branch
(0 / 14 / 15 / 7). Pre-existing, unchanged, pinned RESIDUAL: constructing
the FIRST of two classes whose constructor writes a field throws (s7/f 102
on main and branch, node 3). Neighbour pins: issue-4770 / issue-5383 pass;
issue-5318-r4 has the same 4 stale RESIDUAL failures on main `ce6631272c`.

S9 note: two arms in property-access-dispatch.ts. (1) The class-object
`C.constructor` fold (`emitClassStaticMemberRead`) declines when a static
accessor owns `<C>_constructor`, so the ordinary static-accessor read below
calls the getter. (2) The "illegal cast" was not the #6767 param-inference
family the plan suspected: `finalizeStructAndDynamicMemberGet`'s INSTANCE
accessor arm tested `classAccessorSet` (which also holds static accessors)
and called the static `C_get_constructor` with `C.prototype` cast to the
instance struct. It now skips a `constructor` key that is a static accessor
(an instance accessor of that name is an early error, so the guard cannot
hide a real one). The plan's second site (`:4450` class-instance
`.constructor` arm) needed no change. Not standalone-gated: both conditions
require a class with a static accessor named `constructor`, which no ES5
program has. Neighbour pins issue-5195-r3-restricted-properties /
issue-6767 21/21.

S10 note: three parts. (1) `installRegExpLastIndexCarrierArms`
(regexp-lastindex-carrier.ts) splices a `__getOwnPropertyDescriptor` arm —
`(read(o), writable = !$lastIndexNonWritable)` through `__create_descriptor`,
§22.2.3.3 non-enumerable / non-configurable — and (2) a `__delete_property`
arm answering `false` (§10.1.10 step 4; the strict operator turns it into the
TypeError). #6770 had not published a native-carrier gOPD ladder, so the arms
sit with the other lastIndex MOP arms. (3) The typed gOPD fold in
`compileBuiltinStaticCall` declined the vestigial struct of an Array subclass
(#2917) but not of a new-site builtin subclass (`class RE extends RegExp {}`,
whose instance IS the `$RegExp` carrier): `newSiteBuiltinParent` now declines
it too, so a literal key reaches the dynamic native. ES5 control: every ES5
`built-ins/RegExp/**` + `built-ins/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor/**` row
that passes in the standalone baseline (805) still passes (non-isolated run;
the 9 rows that first reported "quickjs provider is not built" re-run
`--isolate` after building it: 9/9). Neighbour pins issue-4098 / issue-4491*:
the same 6 failures on main `ce6631272c` and the branch.

S11 note: new leaf `classes/class-heritage-runtime-get.ts`, called right after
the S6 comma-effects line at the three ClassDefinitionEvaluation sites
(nested-declarations.ts, variables.ts, new-super.ts). For a standalone class
in `classDynamicUnresolvedHeritageSet` (not linked, no builtin parent, not
already thrown for by the r3-5 check, heritage not an identifier bound to a
local function/class DECLARATION, whose `prototype` is a non-configurable data
property) it compiles the heritage value once (a comma heritage's tail only),
skips a null/undefined value, reads `__extern_get(v, "prototype")` and throws
"Class extends value does not have valid prototype property" when the answer
is neither null/undefined nor an object/function. The module-init collector
(declarations.ts) routes a top-level class declaration and a class-expression
binding of that shape through `compileNestedClassDeclaration` so the read
happens at definition (the row's first class is top-level). Deliberately
one-sided, recorded residuals: an `undefined` `prototype` (spec: TypeError) is
not thrown for, IsConstructor (step 5.f) is not re-checked, and a function
declaration whose `prototype` was reassigned to a primitive is not caught —
on this lane an unmodelled carrier also answers `undefined`, so throwing there
could reject valid programs. `ensureObjectRuntime` and
`heritageExpressionNeedingRuntimeCheck` join the core delegates (#6797, keeps
the leaf out of the codegen SCC: 697). Host bytes unchanged (standalone-gated).
Class control: all 209 baseline-passing ES2015 class rows that contain
`extends` still pass (non-isolated; 5 re-run `--isolate` after rebuilding the
QuickJS adapter: 5/5). Neighbour pins issue-5195-r3-heritage-check /
issue-6767 / issue-6640 / issue-6644 (both) pass.

S12 note: deviates from the plan in where the key logic lives — the helpers
went into `class-member-keys.ts` (already the funcMap-key module, outside the
SCC) instead of a new leaf. `ctx.classInstanceAccessorKeys` (`<C>_<p>` of every
INSTANCE class accessor) is filled in the pre-population loop before any key
is minted; `staticAccessorFuncKey` relocates a static half with an instance
twin to `__cm$static$<C>_get_<p>`; `staticReceiverAccessorKey` is what the
static-receiver consumer sites look up (relocated key for a twin, the site's
own legacy key otherwise); `isInstanceAccessorKey` replaces the
`classAccessorSet.has && !staticAccessorSet.has` spelling, which also said
"no" for an instance accessor with a static twin. Sites: registration and
body emission (class-bodies.ts), the static-`this` and class-object reads and
the instance dummy-receiver arm (property-access-dispatch.ts), `C.x = v`,
`C[k] = v`, `C.prototype[k] = v` (assignment.ts), `C[k]` / `C.prototype[k]`
(property-access.ts), the prototype install list (class-proto-accessors.ts),
the member-get dispatcher (member-get-dispatch.ts) and the static sidecar's
half lookup + closure-cache names (class-static-sidecar.ts — the instance and
static halves must not share a `emitCachedMethodClosureAccess` cache key).
The prepared-accessor predicates in declarations.ts were left alone: they
decline a twin, which is the conservative answer. Byte identity: for every
class without a static/instance twin, both lanes' binaries are identical to
S11 (p1, p4, p6, p10, p17, s9/c; sha256 A/B); only twin classes change, on
both lanes (host s12/a 3 -> 15, s12/b 2 -> 15, s12/d 0 -> 8). The #6767 pins
flipped: p12 now 511 (= node) and its R1 RESIDUAL now answers 3. Class
control: the 112 baseline-passing ES2015 class rows containing `static get` /
`static set` all pass. Neighbour pins issue-6767 / issue-4455 /
issue-5151 pass; issue-5318-r4 and -r5 keep exactly main's failures (4 and 3).
Residual (measured): a subclass's read of an inherited static twin is
still wrong — s12/f (`class Q extends P {}`, `Q.x`) answers 1 on main and on
the branch (node 3); the inheritance alias loop does not carry the relocated
static half.

#### Final measurement (2026-10-02, resume 5)

Base = `origin/main` @ `ce6631272c` (the merged sha; `src` snapshot by
`git archive`, its own QuickJS adapter built); branch = `f78a4e57ad` + docs.
All 34 rows, `--isolate --standalone`, shared lock:

Every branch non-pass is also non-pass on main. Still red, first failing
assertion / cause:

Controls, rebuilt from the fresh standalone baseline
(`.test262-cache/test262-standalone-current.jsonl`, fetched 2026-10-02,
41,999 passing rows) with `generate-editions.ts::classifyEdition`: 2,264
ES2015 class/super rows + 1,634 ES5 rows (the union of the per-step ES5 pin

("This statement should not be evaluated") and fail identically on main

this branch; whether CI's sharded runner reproduces them was not checked
(ES5 is a completed edition, so they are worth a look on main).

## 2026-10-10 current GeneratorFunction subclass negative handoff

Source/evidence update only; no ownership adoption or completed repair. Root
verified the same full census session 62071 / shard-one PID53943 live at frozen
execution HEAD `38901fff8f9a5ca029cbefcdaec5d8dd40949861`. Canonical original
`test/language/statements/class/subclass/builtin-objects/GeneratorFunction/instance-length.js`
records FAIL, `length should be an own property`: standalone, honest oracle14,
providers auto, strict both, reached_test true, compile_ms4078, exec_ms60.
Root fully read and hashed the unchanged original:
`ea432b0c4d335318c5b97422a819f9e79f9ed72debf43238b6df40f393db395c`.

The test obtains GeneratorFunction via the generator function's prototype
constructor, subclasses it, constructs GFn with two parameter strings and a
body, and uses propertyHelper to demand the resulting function's OWN length2
data descriptor (writable/enumerable false, configurable true). The first own
property failure does not prove later value/flag/mutation assertions executed
or both variants ran. It is not the same observation as intrinsic
is-a-constructor's false result, and the intrinsic constructor's seeded length1
cannot satisfy this resulting function's length2 obligation.

This exact original is already in this issue's deferred provider-construction
surface, cross-referenced to6640/4238. The current intrinsic builder source
documents its callable/constructible carrier and separately out-of-scope
CreateDynamicFunction invocation. Do not treat that comment as runtime route
proof or fix the wrong constructor object's descriptor. Before implementation,
inspect actual subclass NewTarget forwarding, provider-created result identity,
own descriptor producer and ordinary reflection route. Preserve name/prototype,
returned callable/generator behavior, abrupt completion and ordinary subclass
controls; coordinate current constructor/provider owners without taking IR or
shared source ownership. Historical umbrella successes do not remeasure this
frozen epoch. No duplicate issue, source change, heavy overlap, replay, compile
or runtime gain is claimed here.

Current canonical partial1049unique:1028PASS,14FAIL,onecompile_error,
sixcompile_timeout,10729unsettled; no accounting problems. Full11778including
74Intl acceptance remains unachieved. Natural full-run terminal and root's
serialized verification release remain required; no original is excluded.
