# #131 — String concatenation with variables

## Problem
String concatenation with `+` only works for string literals. Variable-based concatenation (`str + name`, `str += "suffix"`) is skipped/fails because the compiler doesn't handle `externref + externref` string concat or `+=` on string-typed variables.

## Scope
- `"hello " + name` where `name` is a string variable
- `str += "world"` compound assignment
- Template literal substitutions already work; this is about `+` operator

## Implementation
- In `compileBinaryExpression`, when both operands are strings (externref from string), call a `__string_concat(externref, externref) -> externref` host import or inline via native string ops
- Handle `+=` compound assignment for string locals
- Remove/narrow the string concatenation skip filters in test262-runner.ts

## Tests blocked
~200+ test262 tests use string concatenation patterns

## Complexity: M
