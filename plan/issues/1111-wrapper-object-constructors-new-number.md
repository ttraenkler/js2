# #1111 — Wrapper object constructors: new Number/String/Boolean

## Status

Largely already implemented: `compileNewExpression` in `src/codegen/expressions/new-super.ts` already routes `new Number(x)` / `new String(x)` / `new Boolean(x)` to host imports `__new_Number` / `__new_String` / `__new_Boolean`, producing real JS wrapper objects. This matters because:

- `typeof (new Number(42)) === "object"` — the host returns a JS Number object, whose `typeof` is "object". ✓
- `+(new Number(42)) === 42` — unary `+` goes through the valueOf host path. ✓
- `!!(new Boolean(false)) === true` — wrapper truthiness is "always truthy" at the host level. ✓
- `(new Number(42)) == 42` — JS `==` unboxes the wrapper via ToPrimitive. ✓

Missing pieces prior to this PR were the **equality-comparison corner cases**:

- `new Number(42) === 42` must be `false` (different JS types, per spec), but the compiler was unboxing the wrapper to f64 and comparing → `true`.
- `new Number(42) === new Number(42)` must be `false` (two different objects), but a numeric-unbox fallback made it `true`.
- `new String("x") == new String("x")` must be `false` (per §7.2.15, two objects compare by reference). The old string-content fast path (`string.equals`) was firing for String wrappers and returning `true` by content.

## Fix

`binary-ops.ts`: when either operand's static TypeScript type is a wrapper (`Number` / `String` / `Boolean` with capital-letter symbol = JS object), bypass both the string-content fast path and the numeric-unbox fallback, and route directly through `__host_eq` / `__host_loose_eq`. The JS host primitive gives the spec-correct answer for both strict and loose equality without any further compiler heuristics.

The fix is TypeScript-type driven: `var x = new Number(42)` infers `x: Number` (wrapper), which is what test262 JS files look like to the TypeScript checker. Casts like `as unknown as number` that erase the wrapper type fall outside the static detection (they'd need runtime dispatch).

## Test Results

Added `tests/issue-1111.test.ts` with 13 cases covering `typeof`, unary `+`, `!!`, strict and loose equality against primitives, and reference identity between two wrappers — **13/13 pass**.

Sampled 40 test262 tests from the "fail" bucket that mention `new Number/String/Boolean`. The majority that remain failing do so for *other* reasons (method-assignment onto wrappers like `__instance.charAt = String.prototype.charAt`, nested `new new X(...)` TypeError expectations, `new Object() == new Object()`, etc.) which are out of scope for this issue. The equality-specific sub-checks (e.g. `new Number(1) == new Number(1)` must be false) are fixed by this change, verified by compiling just those CHECKs in isolation — all pass.

Ran 80 currently-passing equality tests from test262 as a regression-guard: **0 regressions**.

## Complexity: S (smaller than originally estimated — most of the support was already there)
