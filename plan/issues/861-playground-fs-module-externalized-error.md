# #861 -- Playground: fs module externalized for browser compatibility

## Problem

The playground fails to load with:
```
Uncaught Error: Module "fs" has been externalized for browser compatibility.
Cannot access "fs.readFileSync" in client code.
```

`src/index.ts` imports `fs` (via `src/compiler.ts` and `src/checker/index.ts`), which Vite externalizes for the browser. The playground tries to use the compiler in-browser but the compiler reads lib files from disk via `fs.readFileSync`.

## Root cause

`src/checker/index.ts` uses `fs.readFileSync` to read TypeScript lib `.d.ts` files. This works in Node.js (CLI, test262, compiler workers) but fails in the browser.

## Fix approaches

1. **Bundle lib files as strings** — at build time, embed lib `.d.ts` contents as JS string constants. The checker reads from the embedded strings instead of `fs`.
2. **Virtual file system** — replace `fs.readFileSync` with a pluggable file reader that defaults to `fs` in Node and uses a pre-loaded Map in the browser.
3. **Separate browser build** — create a browser-specific entry point that pre-loads libs via fetch.

Option 2 is cleanest — the `IncrementalLanguageService` already uses a custom `CompilerHost` that could serve as the pattern.

## Affected files

- `src/checker/index.ts` — `getLibSource()` reads from disk
- `src/checker/language-service.ts` — custom host delegates to `getLibSourceFile()`
- `playground/` — Vite config and entry point

## Acceptance criteria

- Playground loads without fs errors
- Compiler works in-browser with pre-loaded lib files
- Node.js CLI/tests continue to work unchanged
