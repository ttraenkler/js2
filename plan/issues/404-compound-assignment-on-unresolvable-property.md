# #404 — Compound assignment on property (88 CE)

## Status: open

88 tests fail with "Cannot compile compound assignment on property 'prop' -- unresolvable type". The compiler cannot determine the type of the property being assigned to, so it cannot emit the correct read-modify-write sequence.

## Details

Compound assignment on a property (e.g., `obj.x += 1`) requires:
1. Read the current value (`struct.get`)
2. Apply the operator (`i32.add`, `f64.add`, etc.)
3. Write the result back (`struct.set`)

Step 1 requires knowing the property type to emit the correct `struct.get` with the right field index. When the type resolver cannot determine the property type (e.g., the object is typed as `any` or the property is dynamic), the compiler bails out.

Fix: Fall back to externref-based property access for unresolvable types, or emit a runtime type check.

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Compound assignment on known struct properties works
- [ ] Compound assignment on unresolvable types falls back gracefully
- [ ] Reduce "unresolvable type" CEs by 60+
