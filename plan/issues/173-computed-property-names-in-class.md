# #173 — Computed property names in class declarations

## Status: in-review
## Problem
44 test262 compile errors: "A computed property name in a class property declaration must have a simple literal type or a 'unique symbol' type." Classes with computed property names (e.g., `class { [expr]() {} }`) are not supported.

## Fix
Support computed method names in class declarations by evaluating the expression at compile time (for string/number literals) or generating a dynamic dispatch table.

## Tests blocked
~44 compile errors

## Complexity: M

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Most of the infrastructure for computed property names in classes was already in place from prior work:
- TS diagnostic codes 1166, 2464, 1468 were already suppressed in `src/compiler.ts`
- `resolveClassMemberName()` in `src/codegen/index.ts` already delegates to `resolveComputedKeyExpression()` for computed names
- `collectClassDeclaration()` already handles computed property names for fields, methods, getters, setters, and static members

The remaining gap was in **element access call expressions** (`c[0]()`, `c[constKey]()`). The handler in `compileCallExpression` only checked for `ts.isStringLiteral` keys, missing numeric literals and const variable references. Extended the handler to resolve any compile-time-evaluable key using `resolveComputedKeyExpression`.

### What worked
- String literal computed names (`["name"]() {}`) already worked end-to-end
- Numeric literal computed names (`[0]() {}`) now work after fixing element access calls
- Const variable computed names (`[key]() {}` where `const key = "x"`) already worked
- Computed getters/setters already worked

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: Extended element access call handler (line ~9435) to resolve numeric literals and const variable references via `resolveComputedKeyExpression`
- `tests/equivalence/computed-property-class.test.ts`: New test file with 7 tests covering string literal, numeric literal, const variable, getter/setter, static, and multiple computed method scenarios
