# #683 — Runtime type narrowing: emit specialized code for typeof/instanceof guards

## Status: open

When TS narrows a type via `if (typeof x === "string")`, the true branch knows x is a string. But we still compile x as externref in both branches.

### Approach
1. Detect typeof/instanceof guards in if conditions
2. In the true branch, re-resolve the variable's Wasm type using the narrowed TS type
3. Emit specialized code (e.g., unbox to string type instead of keeping as externref)
4. For `instanceof`: cast to the specific struct type in the true branch

### Impact
Many test262 tests use typeof guards to branch on type. Currently the narrowed branch still does externref dispatch — slower and sometimes produces wrong results.

## Complexity: M
