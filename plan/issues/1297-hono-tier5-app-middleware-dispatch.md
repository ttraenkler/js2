# #1297 — Hono Tier 5: Application class, route registration, middleware dispatch, Context

## Background

Tiers 1–4 proved the routing data structures compile. Tier 5 lifts the floor to the actual
`Hono` application object: registering handlers, dispatching to them, and the `Context`
wrapper object. This is the first tier where you write code that looks like real Hono usage.

## What Tier 5 covers

### Step 1 — Minimal App class (no Request/Response yet)

Avoid Web API host imports initially. Model Request and Response as plain objects:

```typescript
type Handler = (c: Context) => string;

class Context {
  path: string;
  params: Map<string, string>;
  constructor(path: string) {
    this.path = path;
    this.params = new Map();
  }
  text(s: string): string { return s; }
}

class App {
  private routes: Map<string, Handler> = new Map();
  get(path: string, handler: Handler): App {
    this.routes.set(path, handler);
    return this;
  }
  dispatch(path: string): string {
    const handler = this.routes.get(path);
    if (!handler) return "404";
    return handler(new Context(path));
  }
}
```

Test: `app.get('/hello', c => c.text('world')).dispatch('/hello')` === `"world"`.

### Step 2 — Middleware chain (compose pattern)

```typescript
type Next = () => string;
type Middleware = (c: Context, next: Next) => string;

function compose(middlewares: Middleware[]): (c: Context) => string {
  return (c: Context) => {
    let i = 0;
    function next(): string {
      const mw = middlewares[i++];
      if (!mw) return "end";
      return mw(c, next);
    }
    return next();
  };
}
```

Test: two middlewares that prepend/append to a string, verify ordering.

### Step 3 — Method chaining + multiple routes

```typescript
const app = new App();
app.get('/a', c => c.text('A'))
   .get('/b', c => c.text('B'))
   .get('/c', c => c.text('C'));
```

Test all three routes dispatch correctly.

### Step 4 — Parameterized routes via TrieRouter integration

Wire Tier 3/4's `TrieRouter` as the routing backend. Handler is stored at the matched node.
Dispatch extracts params from the trie match and populates `Context.params`.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `tests/stress/hono-tier5.test.ts` exists and all tests pass
2. Tier 5a: minimal App + Context compiles and dispatches (`c.text()` returns correct value)
3. Tier 5b: method chaining `app.get(...).get(...)` works — returns `App` for chaining
4. Tier 5c: middleware compose — two middlewares run in correct order
5. Tier 5d: 3+ routes registered, each dispatches to the right handler
6. No regression in Tier 1–4 tests
7. Document any compiler gaps hit as follow-up issues

## Likely compiler gaps

- `Map<string, Handler>` where `Handler` is a function type — function-typed map values
- Closures captured in middleware array — closure in `Middleware[]`
- `i++` inside a closure that references outer `i` — mutable captured variable
- Return type inference for chained methods — `get(): App` returning `this`
- Generic function types (`(c: Context) => string`) as map values

## Files

- `tests/stress/hono-tier5.test.ts` (new)
- `src/` — fix any new compiler gaps found (file depends on what fails)

## Non-goals

- Real `Request`/`Response` Web API objects — deferred to Tier 6
- `async` handlers — deferred
- Full Hono source compilation — still too large

## Test Results (2026-05-03)

`tests/stress/hono-tier5.test.ts` — 14 cases total, 10 pass + 4 skipped.

### First describe block (Map<string, Handler> shape — mirrors real Hono)

Passing (4):
- Tier 5a — unregistered path returns 404 (no handler invocation needed)
- Tier 5b — chained `.get(...)` calls register all three routes (verified
  via `routeCount()`)
- Tier 5c — compose: middleware that does NOT call `next()` short-circuits
- Tier 5c — compose: empty middleware array returns `"end"` sentinel

Skipped (4) — blocked on **#1298**: function-typed values stored in
`Map<string, Handler>`, `{ [k: string]: Handler }`, or `Handler[]` lose
callability when retrieved by index. The set side correctly emits
`__fn_wrap_N_struct` boxing; the call side drops the loaded externref
and pushes `ref.null extern` instead of unwrapping + `call_ref`.

### Second describe block (parallel-array workaround — proves contract today)

End-to-end dispatch validated using `paths: string[] / ids: number[]` +
module-level `runHandler(id, c)` dispatcher. Same observable behavior
as the Map shape, different representation. Passing (6):

- Tier 5a' — minimal App dispatches single route to handler body ("A")
- Tier 5d' — three routes registered, each dispatches correctly + 404
- Tier 5e — `Context.path` is readable from inside the handler
- Tier 5f — chain returns same App; all 3 routes accumulate
- Tier 5c' — middleware compose: 2 layers wrap correctly
  ("<a><b>end</b></a>")
- Tier 5c'-3 — middleware compose: 3 layers wrap correctly
  ("<a><b><c>end</c></b></a>")

### Compiler gaps filed as follow-up issues

- **#1298** — Function-typed fields/arrays/Map values null-deref on
  call. Set side correctly boxes via `__fn_wrap_N_struct`, call site
  doesn't unwrap. Repro + fix-location + acceptance criteria documented
  in `plan/issues/1298-fn-typed-fields-call-drops.md`.
- **#1299** — Virtual dispatch through abstract-base-typed dict values
  resolves to first stored subclass's method for ALL stored values.
  Surfaced while exploring abstract-class workaround for #1298.
- **#1300** — Closures capturing outer parameter inside an inline
  lambda passed as a `Next` callback null-deref at call time. Surfaced
  while exploring inline-compose workaround in middleware. Tier 5
  works around by hoisting middleware steps to module-level functions.
- **#1301** — Wasm validator rejects closure env: `struct.new[0]
  expected type f64, found local.get of type anyref @+1438` when
  compiling two arrow middlewares each calling `next()` from a shared
  `Middleware[]` literal. Single arrow + non-calling-next variants
  compile fine (see passing 5c short-circuit/empty cases). Distinct
  from #1300 — fires before runtime, blocks the canonical inline
  compose pattern. Skipped Tier 5c case `5c — two middlewares run in
  registration order` references this issue.

### Regression check

Hono Tier 1-4 stress tests: 19/19 still pass.
