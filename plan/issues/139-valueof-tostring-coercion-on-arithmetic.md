# Issue #139: valueOf/toString coercion on arithmetic operators

**Status: in-review**
**Completed: 2026-03-13**

## Problem
Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, unary `+`, unary `-`) did not call `valueOf()` on objects before performing the operation.

## Root Cause
- For binary arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`): numericHint was already set in `compileBinaryExpression`, so `coerceType(ref → f64)` via valueOf was triggered by `compileExpression`. These operators already worked correctly for most cases.
- For unary `-`: struct ref operands fell through to `f64.neg` without coercion, causing a type mismatch.
- For unary `+`: already handled correctly via `tryStaticToNumber` and explicit ref coercion.
- The valueOf/toString skip filter in test262-runner.ts prevented these tests from running.

## Fix (in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`)
1. Added struct ref coercion in unary minus before `f64.neg` — calls `coerceType(ref, f64)` which invokes valueOf
2. Added general struct ref handling in `compileBinaryExpression` that coerces refs to f64 before any numeric or equality operation
3. Removed valueOf/toString skip filter from `tests/test262-runner.ts`

## Tests Added
- `tests/equivalence/object-literal-getters-setters.test.ts`: "valueOf coercion on arithmetic operators (#139)"
- `tests/issue-139.test.ts`: dedicated test file with 4 test cases (unary minus, multiplication, all arithmetic ops, both operands as valueOf objects)

## Implementation Summary
### What was done
The valueOf/toString coercion infrastructure was already in place from issue #138. Two key additions were needed:
1. **Unary minus** (`compilePrefixUnary`, MinusToken case): Added `coerceType(ref, f64)` before `f64.neg` for non-f64 operands (line ~5901), which triggers valueOf on struct refs.
2. **Binary arithmetic** (`compileBinaryExpression`): Added struct ref valueOf coercion block (lines ~2707-2742) that detects ref/ref_null operands and coerces them to f64 via `coerceType` before numeric, comparison, or loose equality operations. Strict equality uses `ref.eq` for reference identity instead.

### What worked
- The existing `coerceType(ref, f64)` path already handles valueOf lookup (both class methods via `ClassName_valueOf` and closure-based valueOf fields on structs).
- The `numericHint` mechanism in `compileBinaryExpression` already coerced some cases via `compileExpression`, but explicit post-compilation coercion was needed for cases where the hint wasn't applied.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` (existing changes on main)
- `tests/issue-139.test.ts` (new)

### Tests passing
- All 4 tests in `tests/issue-139.test.ts`
- All 6 tests in `tests/equivalence/object-literal-getters-setters.test.ts`
