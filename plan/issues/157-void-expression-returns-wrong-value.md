# #157 — void expression returns wrong value

## Problem
`void` should always return `undefined`, but may not produce correct undefined representation in all contexts.

## Investigation
The void expression implementation is correct:
- Evaluates the operand for side effects, drops its value
- Pushes `ref.null.extern` (which represents `undefined`)
- Returns `externref` type

When used in f64 context, the outer `coerceType` converts externref null to f64 via `__unbox_number`, which returns NaN — correct for `Number(undefined)`.

All test262 void tests (`S11.4.2_*`) are either:
- Skipped (due to `!== undefined` string comparisons or other unsupported features)
- Compile errors (due to TypeScript type errors from test wrapping, not void-specific)

No actual failures in void codegen were found.

## Status: done (no fix needed)
