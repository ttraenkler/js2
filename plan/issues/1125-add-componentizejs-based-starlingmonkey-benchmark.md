# #1125 -- Add ComponentizeJS-based StarlingMonkey benchmark setup with Wizer and Weval

## Problem

The benchmark harness currently supports StarlingMonkey in two incomplete forms:

1. the existing `runtime-eval` lane using `starling.wasm` under Wasmtime
2. an optional adapter slot via `STARLINGMONKEY_ADAPTER`

However, the adapter path is not actually provisioned or documented as a
reproducible setup. As a result:

- the benchmark story falls back to the slower runtime-eval lane
- the AOT adapter lane remains `unavailable` in benchmark results
- StarlingMonkey is not being measured with startup-reduction and
  interpreter-specialization techniques that are expected to materially change
  cold-start behavior

That makes the current comparison incomplete whenever the goal is to measure a
more optimized StarlingMonkey-based component pipeline rather than the generic
runtime-eval flow.

## Goal

Provide a reproducible StarlingMonkey benchmark setup built around
ComponentizeJS with:

- Wizer snapshotting enabled to reduce startup work
- Weval AOT specialization enabled to partially evaluate the interpreter path
- a concrete adapter entrypoint that satisfies the existing benchmark harness
  contract:

```text
$STARLINGMONKEY_ADAPTER <input.js> <output.wasm>
```

## Scope

This issue is about benchmark/tooling integration, not redesigning the harness
around a new benchmark protocol.

The implementation should:

1. define how StarlingMonkey + ComponentizeJS are provisioned locally
2. produce a benchmarkable Wasm artifact from a JS input module
3. plug that artifact into the existing `STARLINGMONKEY_ADAPTER` flow
4. document the required environment variables, build steps, and caveats
5. make the resulting lane usable for repeated local benchmark runs

## Deliverables

1. A concrete adapter script or wrapper checked into the repo
2. Documentation updates for vendor setup and benchmark execution
3. Any setup-script updates needed to provision the required local sources or
   expected build outputs
4. A verified benchmark run where the StarlingMonkey adapter lane reports `ok`
   instead of `unavailable`
5. Notes in the benchmark output or docs clarifying exactly what is being
   measured:
   - runtime-eval lane
   - ComponentizeJS + Wizer + Weval lane

## Acceptance criteria

- `benchmarks/compare-runtimes.ts` can execute a configured
  `STARLINGMONKEY_ADAPTER` path end-to-end
- the adapter generates a Wasm artifact from a benchmark input JS file
- the setup uses ComponentizeJS rather than an ad hoc one-off script path
- Wizer is enabled in the documented setup
- Weval is enabled in the documented setup
- `benchmarks/competitive/README.md` explains how to build and run this lane
- benchmark results no longer show
  `STARLINGMONKEY_ADAPTER is not configured` when the setup is present
- the resulting lane is clearly distinguished from the existing
  StarlingMonkey runtime-eval measurements

## Notes

- Keep the existing runtime-eval lane; this issue adds a second,
  more-optimized comparison path
- If ComponentizeJS or StarlingMonkey impose restrictions on supported JS
  module shape, those constraints must be documented explicitly rather than
  hidden behind adapter failures
- If additional local tools are required beyond the current vendor checkout,
  the setup should pin or document them clearly enough for reproduction

## Implementation Summary (2026-04-27)

**Branch:** `issue-1125-starlingmonkey-benchmark`

### Changes

1. **`benchmarks/competitive/sm-componentize-adapter.mjs`** (new) — canonical
   adapter location, per the issue spec. Defaults Weval AOT specialization to
   ON (it materially changes hot-runtime characteristics, which is why the
   issue mandates it). Wizer pre-init is always on (built into ComponentizeJS).
   Sidecar metadata now exposes explicit `wizerEnabled` / `wevalAotEnabled`
   booleans alongside the legacy `enableAot` field.

2. **`scripts/starlingmonkey-componentize-adapter.mjs`** — replaced the
   previous standalone implementation with a thin shim that forwards to the
   canonical adapter, so older docs and env configs that point at the old
   path keep working.

3. **`benchmarks/compare-runtimes.ts`** —
   - Added `defaultStarlingMonkeyAdapter()` which picks up the bundled adapter
     whenever `@bytecodealliance/componentize-js` is resolvable through Node
     (`import.meta.resolve`). `STARLINGMONKEY_ADAPTER=` (empty) still opts out
     explicitly. Setting it to a path still overrides.
   - Renamed the lane label from `StarlingMonkey + ComponentizeJS -> Wasmtime`
     to `StarlingMonkey + ComponentizeJS (Wizer + Weval) -> Wasmtime` so the
     two StarlingMonkey lanes are obviously distinct in reports.
   - Updated the success notes to surface `Wizer pre-init: on; Weval AOT:
     on/off` and the bundled-vs-custom adapter path.
   - Improved the "unavailable" notes to point users at `pnpm install` when
     the adapter file is present but ComponentizeJS isn't installed.

4. **`benchmarks/competitive/README.md`** — rewrote the "StarlingMonkey +
   ComponentizeJS (Wizer + Weval)" section: required tools, install steps,
   env-var table, what each lane measures (with a side-by-side runtime-eval
   vs ComponentizeJS+Wizer+Weval comparison), caveats about Weval download
   and module size.

5. **`scripts/setup-benchmark-vendors.mjs`** — synced its inline README to
   point at the new adapter location and document the auto-detect default.

### Acceptance criteria

| Criterion | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `compare-runtimes.ts` can execute a configured `STARLINGMONKEY_ADAPTER` end-to-end | yes (was already true; now also auto-configured) |
| The adapter generates a Wasm artifact from a benchmark JS file | verified — 14.8 MB component for `array-sum.js` |
| The setup uses ComponentizeJS rather than an ad-hoc one-off path | yes — `@bytecodealliance/componentize-js@^0.20.0` |
| Wizer is enabled in the documented setup | yes — built into ComponentizeJS, always on |
| Weval is enabled in the documented setup | yes — default-on (`STARLINGMONKEY_COMPONENTIZE_AOT=1`) |
| `benchmarks/competitive/README.md` explains build + run | yes — full section with env-var table and lane comparison |
| Benchmark results no longer show `STARLINGMONKEY_ADAPTER is not configured` when the setup is present | yes — auto-detect via `import.meta.resolve("@bytecodealliance/componentize-js")` |
| Lane is clearly distinguished from runtime-eval | yes — distinct id `starlingmonkey-componentize-wasmtime` and label `... (Wizer + Weval) -> Wasmtime` |

### Test Results

End-to-end probe in this worktree (no `wasmtime` installed, so the lane
proceeds past the adapter step and would only be blocked at `wasmtime
compile`):

```
STARLINGMONKEY_ADAPTER (effective): /workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-1125/benchmarks/competitive/sm-componentize-adapter.mjs
=> lane status would NOT be 'unavailable' (default-detection succeeded)

adapter exit code: 0 in 4405 ms
output file size: 14816483 bytes
metadata: { kind: "component", invokeExport: "run", hotInvokeExport: "run-hot",
            componentize: { wizerEnabled: true, wevalAotEnabled: true, ... } }
=> adapter step succeeded; lane would proceed to wasmtime-compile
```

`tsc --noEmit` clean. Equivalence tests not run — changes are purely
benchmark tooling and touch no compiler source; no test imports the modified
files.

### Known constraint

The lane needs `wasmtime` installed to actually report `ok` end-to-end. This
container does not have `wasmtime`, so the lane will report `runtime-error`
("wasmtime compile failed") rather than `unavailable` — which is the
acceptance-criterion-relevant change. CI runners with `wasmtime` (or anyone
running locally with it on `PATH`) will see `ok`.
