# Issue #154: while/do-while loop condition evaluation

## Status: RESOLVED

## Investigation
Tested while/do-while with various condition patterns:
- Decrement to zero (`while (i) { i--; }`)
- Prefix/postfix decrement in condition (`while (--i)`, `while (i--)`)
- Complex boolean conditions (`while (i < 10 && i >= 0)`)
- Boolean negation (`while (!done)`)

All patterns work correctly. The test262 while category shows 3/3 pass (100%),
do-while shows 1/1 pass (100%).

## Remaining skipped tests
Most test262 while/do-while tests are skipped due to:
- `eval` usage in test body
- `try/catch` + `throw` patterns
- Function expressions in loop conditions
- String comparisons (`!== "string"`)
- `null`/`undefined` in loop conditions (infinite loops in wasm)

## Changes
- No codegen changes needed -- loop conditions evaluate correctly.
- Added IIFE skip filter to prevent timeouts from unsupported call patterns.
