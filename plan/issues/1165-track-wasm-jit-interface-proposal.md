# #1165 — Track Wasm JIT interface proposal (`func.new`)

## What it is

The [Wasm JIT interface proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/jit-interface/blob/main/proposals/jit-interface/Explainer.md)
by Ben Titzer introduces a `func.new` instruction that materialises a callable
`funcref` from Wasm bytecode stored in linear memory at runtime:

```wat
;; bytecode for a new function lives at memory offset $ptr, byte length $len
(func.new $scope $type (i32.const $ptr) (i32.const $len))
;; → funcref of type $type, validated and ready to call
```

A new "scope" section in the module declares which module elements (functions,
tables, globals, memories) the dynamically generated code may access,
preserving static analysis and dead-code elimination.

**Motivation**: guest language runtimes (Python, Lua, JS interpreters) running
on Wasm currently operate only in interpreted mode. Dynamic code generation can
be **10–100× faster**. `func.new` enables JIT compilation inside a Wasm
sandbox without requiring a JS host.

**Status**: early specification phase (scope section binary format TBD).

## Relevance to js2wasm

`func.new` is the long-term native implementation path for:

- **Dynamic eval (#1164)**: today's host-import shim
  (`WebAssembly.compile` + `WebAssembly.instantiate`) is a direct polyfill of
  `func.new` semantics using the JS boundary. Once `func.new` ships, this
  collapses to: compile eval string → bytes in memory → `func.new` → call.
- **Standalone eval (#1066)**: the wasmtime recursive-compilation approach
  becomes unnecessary for runtimes that support `func.new`.
- **`new Function(...)` (#future)**: same path as eval.

The full pipeline once both `func.new` and js2wasm-to-Wasm (#1058) are
available:

```
eval(src)
  → js2wasm (compiled to Wasm, #1058) compiles src → Wasm bytes in linear memory
  → func.new → funcref
  → call funcref → result
```

No JS host, no host process, no recursive instantiation. Pure Wasm.

## What this issue tracks

1. Monitor the proposal for phase progression
   (https://github.com/WebAssembly/jit-interface)
2. When a runtime (V8, SpiderMonkey, Wasmtime) ships `func.new` behind a flag,
   build a proof-of-concept: compile a trivial eval string to Wasm bytes inside
   a js2wasm-compiled module and call `func.new` on the result
3. Replace #1164's host-import shim with a `func.new`-based implementation
   behind `--target wasm-jit` (or equivalent capability flag)
4. Update #1066 to use `func.new` instead of the recursive wasmtime host

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Proposal reaches Phase 2 or a major runtime ships it under a flag
- [ ] Proof-of-concept: `eval("1 + 2")` returns `3` using `func.new` with
      no JS host involvement
- [ ] `func.new` path is gated by a capability check — falls back to #1164
      host-import shim when not available
- [ ] No regressions in existing eval tests (#1163, #1164)
