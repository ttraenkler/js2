# Issue #703: Negative tests -- strict-mode validation for ES-spec parse errors

## Problem

Many test262 negative parse tests (`negative: { phase: parse, type: SyntaxError }`) rely on
TypeScript diagnostics or the `$DONOTEVALUATE` unknown-identifier warning to pass, rather than
the compiler properly detecting the ES-spec violation. This means the tests pass for the wrong
reason.

## Solution

Extended `detectEarlyErrors()` in `src/compiler.ts` with three new validation checks:

1. **Generator/async function declarations in statement position** -- ES spec forbids
   `function*` and `async function` as the body of `if`, `while`, `do-while`, `for`,
   `for-in`, `for-of`, and `with` statements.

2. **Private name (#x) used outside its declaring class** -- ES spec requires private
   identifiers to be declared in an enclosing class body.

3. **var redeclaration conflicting with lexical declarations in block scope** -- ES spec
   says it is a SyntaxError if any VarDeclaredName also occurs in the LexicallyDeclaredNames
   of the same block.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added `isStatementPosition()` helper to detect function declarations in single-statement
  positions (if body, while body, etc.)
- Added `hasAsyncModifier()` helper for async function detection
- Added `isInsideClassWithPrivateName()` to check private identifier usage against enclosing
  class declarations
- Added `checkVarLexicalConflicts()` to detect var/let-const naming conflicts in blocks
- All checks produce proper error messages with source locations

### Impact
- Tests with proper errors: 4348 -> 4447 (+99 tests now caught with meaningful errors)
- Tests relying only on `$DONOTEVALUATE` warning: 247 -> 148 (-99)
- All 4595 negative parse tests continue to pass in the harness
- Zero regressions in equivalence tests

### Files changed
- `src/compiler.ts` -- extended `detectEarlyErrors()` with 3 new validation checks

### What worked
- The existing `detectEarlyErrors` infrastructure made it easy to add new checks
- TypeScript's AST provides all the information needed for these validations
- The checks are conservative (no false positives in the equivalence suite)

### Remaining work
- 148 tests still pass only due to `$DONOTEVALUATE` warning -- these are harder cases
  (module-specific syntax, non-generator function declarations in statement position,
  dynamic import syntax in invalid positions, etc.)
