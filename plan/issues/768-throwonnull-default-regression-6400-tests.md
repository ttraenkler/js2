# #768 -- throwOnNull default regression: ~6400 tests fail with TypeError (null/undefined access)

## Problem

Commit 74aee017 (#728) re-introduced TypeError throws for null property access by adding `throwOnNull: boolean = true` as default parameter to `emitNullGuardedStructGet` and `emitExternrefToStructGet`. This undid the fix from #716 (39d76d07).

The issue: two different "null" scenarios flow through the same code path:
1. **Actual null/undefined access** → should throw TypeError
2. **Type mismatch from ref.cast** → should return default values

Setting the default to `true` made both cases throw, breaking ~6400 tests.

## Implementation Summary

**What was done:** Changed `throwOnNull` default from `true` to `false` in both `emitNullGuardedStructGet` and `emitExternrefToStructGet`.

**Files changed:** `src/codegen/property-access.ts`

**Root cause:** Developer agent implementing #728 didn't know about #716's fix history and set the wrong default.
