# #713 — Cannot destructure: unknown type (69 CE)

## Status: done

## Problem

69 tests fail at compile time with "Cannot destructure: unknown type". The compiler
cannot determine the type of the destructuring source, so it cannot emit the
correct struct.get or array.get instructions.

## Error signature

```
Cannot destructure: unknown type
```

## Root cause hypothesis

When the destructuring source has type `any`, `unknown`, or a dynamically-computed
type, the compiler has no struct/array type information to emit destructuring code.
This commonly happens with:
- Iterator `.next()` return values (the `{value, done}` object)
- RegExp `exec()` return values
- Temporal API method results
- Generic object destructuring from `const` declarations

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added an externref-based fallback path for object destructuring when the source type
cannot be resolved to a known struct. This mirrors the existing externref fallback
that was already in place for array destructuring.

### Changes

1. **`src/codegen/statements.ts`** - Three key changes:
   - **New function `compileExternrefObjectDestructuringDecl`**: Uses `__extern_get(obj, key)`
     with string constant globals as property name keys. Handles default values, null guards,
     and syncs destructured locals to module globals.
   - **Early externref/scalar check in `compileObjectDestructuring`**: When the initializer
     result is already externref, f64, or i32, routes directly to the externref fallback
     (boxing scalars via `__box_number` first).
   - **Fallback at error paths**: The two "Cannot destructure: unknown type" and
     "not a known struct type" error paths now fall back to `extern.convert_any` +
     externref object destructuring when the source is a ref/ref_null type, instead
     of emitting a compile error.

2. **Import addition**: Added `addStringConstantGlobal` to the imports from `./index.js`
   to register property name strings as externref globals.

3. **`tests/issue-713.test.ts`**: New test file with 5 tests covering:
   - Object destructuring with unknown source type (JS mode)
   - Object destructuring with `any`-typed return value
   - Object destructuring with default values on unknown type
   - Array destructuring with unknown source type (JS mode)
   - Const destructuring with null initializer (test262 pattern)

### What worked
- The pattern of using `__extern_get` with string keys via `addStringConstantGlobal`
  integrates cleanly with the existing string constants infrastructure.
- The null guard pattern from `emitNullGuard` handles nullable externref sources.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/statements.ts`
- `tests/issue-713.test.ts` (new)

### Tests
- All 5 new tests pass
- All 55 existing destructuring-related tests pass (no regressions)
