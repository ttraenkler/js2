# #1203 — Differential testing harness

## Problem

test262 measures whether js2wasm handles the ECMAScript specification correctly for
the ~43K tests in the suite. It does not answer a different question: **"for an
arbitrary real-world JavaScript program, does js2wasm produce the same observable
output as a reference engine (V8, SpiderMonkey)?"**

A compiler can pass 60% of test262 and still silently produce wrong answers for programs
it nominally handles — wrong output for edge cases of string conversion, numeric
precision, prototype chain traversal, and similar. Differential testing finds these
bugs by comparing outputs on a corpus of programs, not by checking spec compliance.

The technique is standard in compiler validation (CompCert, CSmith, Alive2 for LLVM
do exactly this). It has extremely high credibility with engine engineers and academics.

## Implementation plan

### Phase 1 — corpus creation (`tests/differential/corpus/`)

Seed the corpus with 1,000+ programs covering:

1. **Numeric precision** (100 programs) — float arithmetic, integer overflow, NaN
   propagation, `-0`, `Infinity`, `Math.*` functions
2. **String operations** (150 programs) — concatenation, slicing, Unicode, template
   literals, `.split()`, `.join()`, `.replace()`, `.match()`
3. **Array operations** (150 programs) — fill, sort, reduce, flatMap, destructuring,
   spread, Array.from
4. **Object operations** (100 programs) — property access, prototype chain, `in`,
   `delete`, `Object.keys/values/entries`, spread
5. **Control flow** (100 programs) — loops, break/continue/label, switch, try/catch/finally,
   generators, async/await
6. **Closures** (100 programs) — mutable capture, nested closure, IIFE, generator closure
7. **Class** (100 programs) — inheritance, private fields, static methods, getters/setters
8. **Built-ins** (200 programs) — Promise, Map, Set, WeakMap, Symbol, RegExp, Date,
   JSON.stringify/parse, console.log formatting

Each program is a self-contained `.js` file that:
- Exports nothing (runs top-to-bottom for side effects)
- Writes its output via `console.log`
- Terminates without user input
- Has no `eval`, `with`, dynamic `import()`

### Phase 2 — harness (`scripts/diff-test.ts`)

```ts
type DiffResult = {
  file: string;
  v8_stdout: string;
  js2wasm_stdout: string;
  match: boolean;
  error?: string;
};
```

For each program in `tests/differential/corpus/`:
1. Run with Node.js (V8): `node <program.js>` → capture stdout
2. Compile with js2wasm: `js2wasm <program.js> -o /tmp/diff.wasm`
3. Run with wasmtime: `wasmtime /tmp/diff.wasm` → capture stdout
4. Compare line-by-line. Float comparison: `parseFloat(a) ≈ parseFloat(b)` with
   relative tolerance 1e-9 (handles float formatting differences between engines).
5. Write results to `benchmarks/results/diff-test.json`

Output summary:
```
Differential test: 1000 programs
  Match:  912 (91.2%)
  Mismatch: 72 ( 7.2%)
  Error:   16 ( 1.6%)
Top mismatch categories:
  - String coercion: 31
  - Float formatting: 18
  - Prototype chain: 12
  - Other: 11
```

### Phase 3 — CI integration

Add `diff-test.yml` (or a step in `ci.yml`) that:
1. Runs the harness on the full corpus.
2. **Blocks the PR** if the match rate drops below the stored baseline
   (`benchmarks/results/diff-test-baseline.json`).
3. The check is delta-based: a new PR must not introduce new mismatches.
   It may improve the baseline (and should commit the updated baseline on merge to main).

A new mismatch on a PR that didn't touch the relevant code area = likely baseline
drift; the CI output shows exactly which program failed and what both outputs were.

### Phase 4 — mismatch triage tool

Add `scripts/diff-triage.ts` that reads `benchmarks/results/diff-test.json` and groups
mismatches by category (string/float/prototype/other) using simple heuristics on the
program file path and test output. Outputs a markdown table suitable for filing issues.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `tests/differential/corpus/` contains ≥ 1,000 programs covering all 8 categories.
2. `scripts/diff-test.ts` runs to completion and writes `benchmarks/results/diff-test.json`.
3. The harness correctly identifies at least 5 real mismatches between js2wasm and V8
   output (proving the harness is actually exercising the compiler, not just comparing
   empty outputs).
4. CI blocks on new mismatches (delta gate, not absolute).
5. The harness completes in ≤ 10 minutes on the GitHub Actions runner.
6. `README.md` mentions differential testing in the "Testing" section.

## Out of scope

- Fuzzing / program generation (corpus is hand-curated or pulled from existing
  open-source test suites like test262 harness scripts, not fuzz-generated).
- Coverage of `eval`, `Proxy`, `Reflect`, `WeakRef`, `FinalizationRegistry`,
  `SharedArrayBuffer`, `Temporal` — same skip list as test262.
- Performance comparison (that's the benchmark suite, not this).
- Cross-engine comparison beyond V8 (SpiderMonkey comparison is a follow-up).

## Risk

1. **Float formatting differences** are the main source of false positives. The tolerance
   comparison in Phase 2 handles most cases, but `toExponential` / `toPrecision` output
   differs between engines for edge values. Mitigate with a known-divergence list.
2. **Corpus quality** — if all programs are trivial, the harness passes trivially. Include
   at least 50 programs that are currently known to fail test262 but pass locally, to
   exercise the edge cases.
3. **Harness runtime** — 1000 programs × (compile + wasmtime spawn) may exceed 10 minutes.
   Mitigate with parallelism (`Promise.all` with a pool of N workers).

## Notes

The approach is directly inspired by CompCert's differential validation (Leroy 2009) and
the fuzzer-based differential testing used to harden V8 (Fuzz testing engines: past,
present, future — Chromium blog 2021). We are doing the corpus-based variant (no fuzzer),
which is lower overhead and sufficient for "does js2wasm get the right answer?" credibility.

## Phase 1 delivery (2026-04-30)

Phase 1 lands the harness infrastructure + a credible seed corpus. Corpus expansion to
1,000+ is a follow-up issue (mechanical work, batches across multiple devs).

### What shipped

- `scripts/diff-test.ts` — the harness. Lane A spawns `node <file>` for V8 reference;
  Lane B compiles in-process via `compile()` and instantiates with `buildImports` +
  `instantiateWasm`, capturing `console.log` output via a monkey-patched console.
- `scripts/diff-triage.ts` — buckets mismatches by heuristic (float-formatting,
  nan-infinity, object-coercion, undefined-leak, numeric-precision, other).
- `scripts/diff-test-gate.ts` — delta gate. Compares `diff-test.json` against
  `diff-test-baseline.json`; exits 1 if any program previously matching now mismatches.
- `tests/differential/corpus/` — 104 hand-written programs across 8 categories
  (numeric × 15, string × 15, array × 15, object × 12, control × 12, closures × 10,
  classes × 10, builtins × 15).
- `benchmarks/results/diff-test-baseline.json` — committed baseline.
- `.github/workflows/diff-test.yml` — CI integration: runs on PR, blocks on delta;
  on push to `main`, refreshes the baseline with `[skip ci]`.
- `package.json` scripts: `test:diff`, `test:diff:triage`, `test:diff:gate`.
- `README.md` — Testing section explaining the three layers (unit, test262, diff).

### Why Node-host instead of wasmtime

The issue plan specified wasmtime as Lane B. The current `--target wasi` codegen has
a known type-mismatch in `__wasi_write_i32` (offset 3830: expected externref, found i32)
that prevents non-trivial programs from running through wasmtime today. The Node-host
lane exercises the **primary** codegen target (WasmGC + wasm:js-string + JS host imports),
which is the path most users hit. wasmtime / SpiderMonkey lanes are documented follow-ups.

### Initial baseline numbers

- 104 programs, 22.8s end-to-end (well under the 10-minute budget — AC #5).
- Match: 63 (60.6%). Mismatch: 17. Compile error: 0. Runtime error: 24. V8 error: 0.
- 41 real divergences found (>> AC #3's "≥5 real mismatches").

Per-category match rate:

| Category | Match | Total | Pct |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| numeric | 14 | 15 | 93% |
| control | 10 | 12 | 83% |
| object | 8 | 12 | 67% |
| string | 9 | 15 | 60% |
| classes | 5 | 10 | 50% |
| closures | 5 | 10 | 50% |
| array | 6 | 15 | 40% |
| builtins | 6 | 15 | 40% |

The high-divergence categories (array, builtins, closures, classes) point to real
compiler bugs that need follow-up issues.

### Follow-up issues to file

1. **Corpus expansion** (1 issue) — grow to 1,000+ programs across the 8 categories,
   batched mechanical work suitable for multiple devs. Pulling subsets of test262
   harness scripts is a sensible source.
2. **Bug-fix issues from Phase 1 triage** — at least 5 distinct buckets surfaced by
   the initial run:
   - `array` runtime errors — multiple `local.set[0] expected type externref` Wasm
     validation failures in array methods (`shift`, `unshift`, `slice`, `splice`,
     `flat`, `flatMap`, `from`, `of`, spread/destructure, `join`/`toString`).
   - `closures` null-pointer dereferences — `closures/05-loop-capture.js` and
     `closures/08-method-chain.js`.
   - `classes/08-fields.js` — class field initializer Wasm validation error.
   - `Promise.then` chain — `builtins/07-promise-basic.js` produces empty stdout
     (expected `42`); `builtins/08-promise-chain.js` similar.
   - `Symbol`, `Map.get`, `JSON.stringify` first-call regressions.
3. **Float-tolerance comparison** — the harness currently does exact string match.
   For programs that print very-small / very-large floats, V8 and js2wasm may format
   identically today but tolerance comparison would harden the harness against future
   formatting drift.
4. **wasmtime lane** — once `--target wasi` codegen is fixed (separate compiler bug),
   add a third lane that runs the same corpus through wasmtime to validate the
   standalone path.
5. **SpiderMonkey lane** — out of scope per the issue, file as a backlog item.
