# #989 -- Enrich invalid Wasm binary CEs with byte offset, WAT slice, and source-mapped location

## Problem

The `invalid Wasm binary (WebAssembly.validate failed)` bucket was too opaque to
split by root cause. It told us that a binary was invalid, but not:

- where validation failed
- which generated function was involved
- which source line emitted the bad code
- which WAT fragment matched the failing binary area

That made the largest remaining compile-error bucket difficult to analyze or
turn into focused follow-up issues.

## Root cause

`scripts/test262-worker.mjs` previously treated validation as a boolean gate:

```ts
if (!WebAssembly.validate(result.binary)) {
  error = "invalid Wasm binary (WebAssembly.validate failed)";
}
```

The repo already had most of the plumbing:

- byte-offset tracking in `src/emit/binary.ts`
- Wasm source maps in `src/emit/sourcemap.ts`
- source-map lookup helpers in `tests/test262-runner.ts`

What was missing was feeding those artifacts into the unified test262 worker
when validation failed.

## Implemented

1. Added invalid-binary enrichment in `scripts/test262-worker.mjs`
2. Extracted the failing byte offset and function name when available
3. Mapped offsets back through the Wasm source map into `Lx:y` source locations
4. Recompiled with WAT output and included a short surrounding WAT excerpt
5. Preserved the enriched message in test262 JSONL output so the CE bucket can
   be split without manual repro

## Result

Verified in the full official-scope recheck
`benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260407-111308.jsonl`:

- `1011` invalid-binary compile errors include a byte offset
- `1011` include a WAT snippet
- `1008` also include a source-mapped `Lx:y` prefix

This bucket is now actionable enough to derive concrete follow-up issues from
the emitted diagnostics instead of treating it as a single opaque CE family.
