# Issue #222: Unknown identifier errors from unhoisted var declarations

## Status: in-review
## Problem

~1200+ compile errors from "Unknown identifier: x" (and y, z, etc.) caused by variables that should be in scope but are not recognized by the compiler. The root cause is that the var-hoisting pre-pass (`hoistVarDeclarations` / `walkStmtForVars`) skips several declaration patterns:

1. **Destructuring patterns**: `var { x, y } = obj` and `var [a, b] = arr` have a BindingPattern as `decl.name`, not an Identifier. The hoisting pass skipped these with `if (!ts.isIdentifier(decl.name)) continue`.

2. **For-in/for-of loop variables**: `for (var x in obj)` and `for (var x of arr)` declare `var` variables that are function-scoped (hoisted), but `walkStmtForVars` only recursed into the loop body without hoisting the loop variable itself.

3. **Module-level destructuring globals**: The module globals registration pass (the "Fourth" pass in `generateModule`) also skipped destructuring patterns with the same `if (!ts.isIdentifier(decl.name)) continue` guard.

## Solution

### 1. `hoistBindingPattern` helper (index.ts)
New function that recursively walks ObjectBindingPattern and ArrayBindingPattern nodes, extracting each bound identifier and pre-allocating a local with the correct type from the TypeScript checker.

### 2. `hoistVarDecl` helper (index.ts)
Unified function for hoisting a single VariableDeclaration, handling both simple identifiers and binding patterns. Used by `walkStmtForVars` for variable statements and for-statement initializers.

### 3. For-in/for-of hoisting (index.ts)
Added var declaration hoisting for `for (var x in obj)` / `for (var x of arr)` initializers in the `walkStmtForVars` function.

### 4. Module-level destructuring globals (index.ts)
Refactored the module globals registration to use a `registerModuleGlobal` helper and added recursive binding pattern handling via `registerBindingNames`.

## Files Changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — hoisting pass fixes
- `tests/equivalence.test.ts` — 4 new test cases

## Test Cases Added
- Object destructuring var hoisting
- Array destructuring var hoisting
- Var in nested block accessible after block
- Var in for-loop body is hoisted
