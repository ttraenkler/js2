# #499 — with statement via static identifier dispatch (94 tests)

## Status: open

94 tests use the `with` statement. Deprecated in strict mode but part of the spec.

## Approach

`with (obj) { x }` dynamically resolves identifiers against `obj` first, then the outer scope. This seems to require dynamic scope — but the compiler can enumerate all identifiers at compile time:

```javascript
with (obj) {
  console.log(x + y);
}
```

Compiles to:
```javascript
console.log(
  (hasOwnProperty(obj, "x") ? obj.x : outer_x) +
  (hasOwnProperty(obj, "y") ? obj.y : outer_y)
);
```

### Implementation
1. Walk the AST inside the `with` block
2. Collect all identifier references
3. For each identifier, emit: `if obj.hasOwnProperty(name) then obj[name] else scope[name]`
4. Requires #488 (hasOwnProperty) for the property check
5. Property writes inside `with`: same dispatch — `if hasOwnProperty(obj, "x") then obj.x = v else outer_x = v`

### Limitations
- `with` + `eval` (eval adds dynamic bindings inside with) — not supported
- Deeply nested `with` blocks — each level adds a dispatch check per identifier

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `with (obj) { return x; }` resolves x from obj if present, else from scope
- [ ] Property writes inside `with` dispatch correctly
- [ ] Nested `with` blocks work
