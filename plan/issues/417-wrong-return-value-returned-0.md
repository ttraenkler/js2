# #417 -- Wrong return value (returned 0): broad runtime correctness failures

## Status: ready

1,979 tests (96% of all runtime failures) compile successfully but return incorrect numeric results -- typically 0 instead of the expected value. This is the single largest failure category.

## Root cause

This is an umbrella issue covering multiple codegen bugs where expressions evaluate to the wrong value at runtime. Common sub-patterns:

1. **Type coercion dropping values**: coercion from externref to f64 returns 0 instead of the actual value
2. **Expression result discarded**: intermediate expression results are dropped from the stack when they should be preserved
3. **Control flow short-circuits**: if/else, ternary, and logical expressions take the wrong branch or return the wrong branch's value
4. **Math built-in edge cases**: special values (Infinity, -0, NaN) not handled correctly by Math methods
5. **Comparison result inversion**: comparison operators return inverted boolean in some type combinations

## Example failures

- `test/built-ins/Math/min/Math.min_each-element-coerced.js` -- Math.min coercion
- `test/built-ins/Math/atanh/atanh-specialVals.js` -- atanh special values
- `test/language/expressions/addition/S11.6.1_A3.1_T2.2.js` -- addition coercion

## Triage approach

This issue should be investigated by sampling 20-30 failures, classifying them into sub-patterns, and then splitting into focused child issues. The sub-patterns will likely map to specific codegen functions.

## Complexity: L

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Investigate and classify at least 30 representative failures
- [ ] Split into focused sub-issues based on root cause patterns
- [ ] Overall fail count for "wrong return value" reduced by at least 30%
