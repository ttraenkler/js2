# #664 — Use source maps for runtime error line numbers in test262 report

## Status: open

Runtime errors (null pointer deref, illegal cast, out of bounds) only show the Wasm function name and byte offset. No TypeScript source line.

### Fix
1. Enable `sourceMap: true` when compiling test262 tests
2. After a Wasm trap, parse the .wasm.map file
3. Map the byte offset from the error message to the original TS line
4. Include the mapped line number in the test result error field

The compiler already supports `--sourceMap`. The source map format is standard (VLQ-encoded mappings). Libraries like `source-map` can parse them.

Fallback: if source maps aren't available, extract the Wasm function name from the error (e.g., `function #6:"test"`) and search for it in the compiled output.

## Complexity: S
