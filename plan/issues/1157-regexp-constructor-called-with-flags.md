# #1153 — RegExp constructor flags = "undefinedy" regression

## Problem

288 test262 tests fail at runtime with:

```
Invalid flags supplied to RegExp constructor 'undefinedy'
```

The status column reports these as `compile_error` (because the host RegExp constructor throws during `WebAssembly.instantiate` / first call into the module), but they are genuine runtime-path regressions — the wasm module is making a `new RegExp(pattern, flags)` host call with `flags = "undefined" + "y"`.

The literal concatenation `"undefined" + "y"` is the smoking gun: somewhere on the String→RegExp desugaring path, an `undefined` value is being stringified (coerced to the literal string `"undefined"`) and then concatenated with the sticky-flag character `"y"`. RegExp rejects `"undefinedy"` as an invalid flag set.

Most failing tests are NOT RegExp tests — they are String.prototype methods that do not construct a RegExp at all, indicating the bad path is triggered indirectly (likely by the wrapped test262 preamble or by a helper that the compiler inserts for string-method lookup).

## Sample failing tests (all `compile_ms` 5–6ms → real compile, error at first run)

```
test/built-ins/String/prototype/matchAll/regexp-prototype-matchAll-throws.js
test/built-ins/String/prototype/normalize/this-is-null-throws.js
test/built-ins/String/prototype/padStart/exception-not-object-coercible.js
test/built-ins/String/prototype/repeat/empty-string-returns-empty.js
test/built-ins/String/prototype/replace/S15.5.4.11_A1_T11.js
```

All were passing on the sprint-42/begin baseline (2026-04-12, 22,412 pass) and regressed by the April 19 merge cascade.

## Root cause hypothesis

The RegExp_new host call sites are registered in two places:

1. `src/codegen/typeof-delete.ts:compileRegExpLiteral` — safe: uses `flags ?? ""` so a missing flag block becomes `""`, not `undefined`.
2. `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts:388` — `RegExp(pattern, flags)` called without `new`. Uses `compileExpression(ctx, fctx, args[i], externInfo.constructorParams[i])` for each passed arg, then `pushDefaultValue` for missing args. If the caller passes `flags` as an `undefined` externref (e.g. from `anyValue.flags` on an object without flags), that `undefined` traverses the externref boundary and reaches the host `new RegExp(pattern, undefined + "y")` — producing the observed `'undefinedy'`.

**Likeliest concrete trigger**: PR #195 (merged 2026-04-19) changed `String.prototype` access to route through `__extern_get(__extern_get(globalThis, "String"), "prototype")`. If the new path lands on a helper that does `new RegExp(raw, self.flags + "y")` (or similar `flags + "y"` assembly) and `self.flags` is `undefined` for some receivers, every call through that path emits the broken RegExp construction.

Look for `+ "y"` / `.flags + ` in:
- `src/runtime.ts` (host RegExp_new handler area, ~L1370–1400, and `_sidecarGet` paths)
- anywhere the compiler synthesizes a RegExp from a bare pattern (String.prototype.search/replace/match/matchAll lowering)

## Fix approach

1. Reproduce via a minimal probe that calls `String.prototype.padStart.call(null)` in a test262-wrapped module. Confirm the RegExp_new host import is being invoked (shouldn't be!).
2. If RegExp_new is called from a String.prototype path, identify the helper in `src/runtime.ts` that does `flags + "y"` (or equivalent) and guard with `(flags ?? "") + "y"`, or better, bypass the RegExp path entirely when the receiver doesn't require regex semantics (e.g. `padStart` has nothing to do with RegExp).
3. Verify that `padStart`, `repeat`, `normalize`, `replace(string, string)` do not call RegExp at all — these should route through plain string helpers.
4. Re-enable `tests/equivalence.test.ts` to ensure no regressions in the covered wrapper/prototype paths.

## Acceptance criteria

- The 5 sample tests above compile, instantiate, and run without hitting RegExp_new at all (or with a valid flags string).
- The `'undefinedy'` cluster count drops to 0 in the test262 report.
- `npm test -- tests/equivalence.test.ts` passes with no new regressions.
- No new `ref.null.extern` coercion regressions for legitimate `RegExp(pattern, undefined)` callers — the spec allows `new RegExp("x", undefined)` which must yield `/x/` (empty flags).

## Resolution 2026-05-01 (developer)

**Already fixed on current main — baseline drift, not a real bug.**

Verified on current `main` HEAD:

1. **Zero `undefinedy` occurrences** in the committed test262 baseline:
   ```
   $ grep -c "undefinedy" benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl
   0
   ```

2. **Only 1 `Invalid flags supplied` failure remains** in the entire
   baseline, and it's an unrelated `'null'` flag bug in
   `test/annexB/built-ins/RegExp/prototype/compile/flags-undefined.js`
   (RegExp.prototype.compile with explicit null flags — different code
   path, separate bug if anyone wants to chase it).

3. **All 5 sample tests cited in the issue file pass** in the baseline:
   ```
   "status":"pass"  test/built-ins/String/prototype/matchAll/regexp-prototype-matchAll-throws.js
   "status":"pass"  test/built-ins/String/prototype/normalize/this-is-null-throws.js
   "status":"pass"  test/built-ins/String/prototype/padStart/exception-not-object-coercible.js
   "status":"pass"  test/built-ins/String/prototype/repeat/empty-string-returns-empty.js
   "status":"pass"  test/built-ins/String/prototype/replace/S15.5.4.11_A1_T11.js
   ```

The bug was likely fixed by the recent string/RegExp/closure runtime
work — possibly a side-effect of the dual-string backend (#679), the
dual-RegExp backend (#682), or one of the subsequent runtime cleanups.
Same pattern as #1226: an old issue file documents a regression that
is no longer reproducible on current `main`.

This matches the
[`feedback_baseline_drift_cross_check.md`](/workspace/.claude/memory/feedback_baseline_drift_cross_check.md)
pattern.

## Sibling bug surfaced (filed separately)

While writing regression tests for the String.prototype paths, I
discovered a related runtime bug: `String.prototype.normalize()` with
no args is currently being padded by the compiler with `null` (via
`ref.null.extern`), and the runtime's `string_method` handler at
`src/runtime.ts:1322` passes that null through verbatim:

```ts
const args = a.map(coerce);
return (String(recv) as any)[method](...args);
```

`"abc".normalize(null)` throws `RangeError: The normalization form
should be one of NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD.` — null is coerced to the string
`"null"` which isn't a valid normalization form. The fix should strip
trailing `null`/`undefined` args before invoking the method, mirroring
the `extern_class` constructor handler at lines 1394-1399 which already
strips trailing nulls. That's a small focused fix that's separate from
the original `'undefinedy'` bug and not in scope for #1157's 288-test
regression cluster.

## Test Results

`npm test -- tests/issue-1157.test.ts` — 6/6 passing on current main:

- `''.repeat(n)` returns empty for n=1, 3, 2147483647
- `'abc'.repeat(0|1|3)` returns empty / `'abc'` / `'abcabcabc'`
- `'x'.padStart(5, ' ')` returns `'    x'`
- `'x'.padEnd(5, '*')` returns `'x****'`
- `'abcabc'.replace('b', 'B')` returns `'aBcabc'` (no RegExp involved)
- Full test262-wrapped `repeat` test simulation runs assertion chain
  without instantiate-time exception
