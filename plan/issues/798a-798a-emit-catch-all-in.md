# #798a -- Emit catch_all in try/catch compilation

## Implementation summary

Added `catch_all` block after `catch $tag` in try/catch compilation. Foreign JS exceptions (from host imports like TypeError) are now caught via catch_all and stored in the catch variable. Uses the exception handling spec's catch_all instruction which is Wasm-native (no host imports needed for the mechanism itself).
