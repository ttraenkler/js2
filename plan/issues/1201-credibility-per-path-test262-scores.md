origin: credibility infrastructure sprint — the aggregate 59.9% pass rate is insufficient for Bytecode Alliance reviewers and academic partners. The infrastructure to display per-edition scores already exists (test262-editions.json feeds t262-edition-timeline on the landing page); what is missing is the per-path category breakdown and its wiring into the feature rows.

# #1201 — Per-path test262 scores: categories in test262-report.json + landing page integration

## Context

The current data pipeline is:
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` produces per-test JSONL results
- CI post-processes into `public/benchmarks/results/test262-report.json` (aggregate) and `test262-editions.json` (per-ES-edition)
- The landing page (`index.html`) already:
  - Reads `test262-editions.json` → renders per-edition pass rate bars in the feature table headers (already working)
  - Has code at line 4240 that reads `report.categories` from `test262-report.json` → populates the "feature areas implemented" stat — but `categories` is not yet present in the JSON
  - Shows individual feature rows with static ✓/⚠/✗ badges, no live test counts
- `public/benchmarks/report.html` already exists as the detailed conformance view

## Problem

Two gaps remain:

1. **Missing categorical data**: `test262-report.json` lacks a `categories` array. The landing page code at line 4240 already expects it (`const categories = report?.categories`) but falls back gracefully. The "feature areas implemented" stat shows the build-time fallback instead of live data.

2. **Feature rows show static badges, not real test counts**: The individual feature rows on the landing page (e.g. "Generators (function*, yield)", "async / await", "Map / Set") have hardcoded ✓/⚠/✗ badges from a prior manual audit. They should also show the actual number of test262 tests that pass for the corresponding test path, so a visitor can see "Generators: ✓ 418/423 tests passing" rather than just a green checkmark.

## Implementation plan

### Phase 1 — Categories array in test262-report.json

Extend the CI post-processing script (or `tests/test262-runner.ts` directly) to emit a `categories` array in `test262-report.json`.

Each category entry covers a depth-2 test path (`built-ins/Array`, `language/statements/generators`, etc.):

```ts
type CategoryResult = {
  path: string;          // "built-ins/Array"
  total: number;
  pass: number;
  fail: number;
  compile_error: number;
  compile_timeout: number;
  skip: number;
};
```

Bucket assignment: use the first 2 path segments of each test file path. If a depth-2 bucket has fewer than 10 tests, collapse to depth-1. Include all buckets including those at 0% — honest zeroes are the point.

The array is added directly to `test262-report.json` so the existing landing page fetch at line 4240 picks it up with no client-side change. It also writes the same data to `public/benchmarks/results/test262-categories.json` for standalone consumption.

This unblocks the existing "feature areas implemented" stat on the landing page stat grid.

### Phase 2 — data-t262-paths attributes on feature rows in index.html

Add `data-t262-paths` attributes to the `<div class="feat-row">` elements in `index.html`. Each value is a comma-separated list of test262 path prefixes that correspond to that feature. Examples:

```html
<div class="feat-row" data-t262-paths="language/statements/generators,built-ins/GeneratorFunction">
<div class="feat-row" data-t262-paths="language/expressions/async-arrow-function,built-ins/Promise">
<div class="feat-row" data-t262-paths="built-ins/Map,built-ins/Set">
<div class="feat-row" data-t262-paths="built-ins/Symbol">
<div class="feat-row" data-t262-paths="built-ins/Array">
<div class="feat-row" data-t262-paths="built-ins/RegExp">
```

Cover at minimum the 30 most prominent feature rows (all rows that currently have a `details` element with a WAT example). Rows without a clear test262 path mapping can be omitted.

### Phase 3 — Landing page JS: hydrate feature rows with live counts

Add a `hydrateFeatureRowCounts()` function in `index.html`'s inline script that:

1. Fetches `./benchmarks/results/test262-categories.json`
2. Builds a path → CategoryResult map
3. For each `.feat-row[data-t262-paths]`:
   - Accumulates pass/total across all listed paths
   - If total > 0, appends a `<span class="feat-row-counts">N/T</span>` next to the `.feat-name` (e.g. `418/423`)
   - Colour-codes: green (≥80%), yellow (50–79%), red (<50%) — matching the existing badge colour scheme
4. Falls back gracefully if the fetch fails (leaves the static badge unchanged)

Add minimal CSS for `.feat-row-counts`:
```css
.feat-row-counts {
  font-family: var(--mono);
  font-size: 10px;
  color: var(--fg-faint);
  margin-left: 8px;
}
```

This gives a visitor browsing the feature table exactly what an engine engineer wants: "does async/await work?" → "✓ 418/423 tests passing".

### Phase 4 — report.html: add categorical breakdown table

`public/benchmarks/report.html` already shows aggregate stats and history. Add a new section below the existing content that renders the `categories` array as a sorted table:

- Columns: Path, Pass %, Pass, Fail, CE, Timeout, Skip, Total
- Sort default: Pass % descending (shows strongest categories first)
- Clickable column headers for re-sort
- Colour coding: green ≥80%, yellow 50–79%, red <50%
- Data loaded at runtime from `./results/test262-report.json` (the `categories` key)
- A "show all" toggle that reveals categories at 0% (hidden by default to reduce noise)

This makes `report.html` the canonical categorical view — no new page needed.

### Phase 5 — CI regeneration

The CI pipeline already writes `test262-report.json` and `test262-editions.json` after the sharded test262 job. Extend the same step to populate the `categories` array in `test262-report.json` and write `test262-categories.json`. No new workflow file needed — extend the existing merge/post-process step.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `public/benchmarks/results/test262-report.json` contains a `categories` array with ≥ 50 entries after the next CI run.
2. `public/benchmarks/results/test262-categories.json` exists as a standalone file with the same data.
3. The "feature areas implemented" stat on `index.html` (`#feature-coverage`) shows a live percentage derived from categories, not the build-time fallback.
4. At least 20 feature rows in `index.html` show live pass counts (e.g. `418/423`) next to the feature name.
5. `public/benchmarks/report.html` shows a categorical table below the existing content, sortable by pass rate.
6. All categories at 0% are present in the data (accessible via "show all"); none silently omitted.
7. CI regenerates the categories data on every push to `main` without manual intervention.

## Out of scope

- A new `public/test262/index.html` page — `public/benchmarks/report.html` is the canonical view.
- Historical trend per category (follow-up issue).
- Drill-down to individual test source (future work).
- Per-feature badge auto-update from test data — the static badges represent manual curation; the live counts supplement them, not replace them.

## Risk

The main risk is the path → feature mapping in Phase 2 being wrong or stale. A wrong mapping (wrong path for a feature) would show misleading counts. Mitigate by verifying each path against actual JSONL data before adding the `data-t262-paths` attribute. The fallback (no attribute = no count shown) means an incorrect mapping is visible as a blank rather than a wrong number — easy to detect.

## Notes

The landing page already has the full machinery for edition-level live data (the `feat-edition-passbar` driven by `test262-editions.json`). This issue fills the equivalent gap at the individual feature level. The two complement each other: edition bars answer "how complete is ES2015 overall?"; feature row counts answer "specifically, do generators work?".
