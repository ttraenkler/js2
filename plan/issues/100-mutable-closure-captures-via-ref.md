# Issue #100: Mutable closure captures via ref cells

## Problem

Closures capture variables by value (copied into the closure struct). Mutations inside the closure don't propagate back to the outer scope.

```ts
let count = 0;
const inc = () => { count++; };
inc();
// count is still 0 in wasm — should be 1
```

## Impact

- Blocks test262 `each-element-coerced` tests (Math.min/Math.max valueOf coercion)
- Any pattern where a closure mutates an outer variable fails silently

## Approach: Ref cell per mutable capture

For each captured variable that is written by either the closure or the outer scope, allocate a `{ value: T }` struct (ref cell). Both sides hold a reference to the same struct and read/write via `struct.get`/`struct.set`. Immutable captures stay by-value (zero overhead).

### 1. Mutation detection

During `compileArrowAsClosure()`, after `collectReferencedIdentifiers()` builds the captures list, scan both the closure body and the outer scope (statements after the closure definition) for writes to each captured identifier. A variable is "mutable capture" if either side writes to it.

Write patterns to detect: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc., `++`, `--` (prefix and postfix).

Each capture gets a `mutable: boolean` flag.

### 2. Ref cell struct & boxing

For each mutable capture of type `T`, register a struct type:

```wasm
(type $ref_cell_T (struct (field $value (mut T))))
```

Deduplicate by value type — all `i32` mutable captures share `$ref_cell_i32`, all `f64` share `$ref_cell_f64`, etc. Helper: `getOrRegisterRefCellType(ctx, valType) → typeIdx`.

In the **outer scope**, when a variable is identified as a mutable capture:
1. After the variable's initial assignment, wrap it: `struct.new $ref_cell_T`
2. Replace the local's type from `T` to `(ref null $ref_cell_T)`
3. All subsequent reads → `struct.get $ref_cell_T 0`
4. All subsequent writes → `struct.set $ref_cell_T 0`

In the **closure struct**, the field stores `(ref null $ref_cell_T)` instead of `T`. The field itself stays immutable — the ref cell's content mutates, not the closure struct field.

In the **closure body**, reads/writes go through `struct.get`/`struct.set` on the ref cell.

### 3. Codegen changes

Track boxed locals in `fctx.boxedCaptures: Map<string, { refCellTypeIdx: number }>`. The existing identifier read/write codegen checks this map and emits the extra indirection.

**Compilation order:**
1. Variable declared and assigned normally → `local.set $count`
2. Compiler encounters arrow function capturing `count` mutably
3. Emit boxing: `local.get $count` → `struct.new $ref_cell_i32` → `local.set $count`
4. Local type changes to ref cell reference
5. All subsequent outer scope code uses `struct.get`/`struct.set`

### 4. Edge cases

- Multiple closures capturing same variable → same ref cell, works naturally
- Closure in loop with `let` → each iteration creates fresh ref cell (correct JS semantics)
- `var` in loops → single ref cell shared across iterations (also correct)
- Nested closures → inner captures ref cell reference, no double-boxing

## Scope

- GC codegen only (not codegen-linear)
- Pure wasm GC — no host imports needed

## Testing

- Basic mutation: closure increments, outer reads updated value
- Multiple calls: call closure N times, outer sees N
- Bidirectional: outer writes, closure reads updated value
- Two closures sharing one variable
- Compound assignment (`+=`, `++`, `--`) inside closure
- Closure in loop with `let`
- Nested closure capturing already-boxed variable
- Immutable captures: existing tests unchanged (no regression)
- test262: `each-element-coerced` tests should pass

## Complexity

L (> 400 lines, multiple files: expressions.ts, index.ts, tests)
