# #1200 — Loop-invariant code motion in our optimizer pass

## Problem

In the canonical for-loop:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  sum += arr[i];
}
```

`arr.length` is evaluated **on every iteration** at codegen time — we emit `local.get $arr; array.len; local.tee $tmp; local.get $i; i32.lt_s; br_if 0`. If `arr` doesn't change inside the loop body, this is wasted work.

Loop-invariant code motion (LICM) hoists the `arr.length` computation to a single location BEFORE the loop, stores it in a local, and uses that local in the condition. Same observable behaviour, one `array.len` op total instead of N.

`wasm-opt -O3` (the Binaryen optimiser, available via `--optimize` / `-O`) is known to do LICM. **Step 1 of this issue is to verify that** — measure with and without `-O` and document. If wasm-opt is already doing it, the issue closes with documentation. If wasm-opt is NOT catching this pattern (because our codegen emits a shape it doesn't recognise), implement it ourselves in the peephole pass.

## Implementation plan

### Step 1 — measurement (no code change)

Compile `array-sum` with and without `-O` (i.e. `--optimize` flag), inspect the resulting wast, count `array.len` occurrences in the inner loop block. If 0 inside the loop body / condition (only one above the loop), wasm-opt is doing it. If multiple, it's not.

Acceptance for Step 1: a documented finding in `plan/notes/wasm-opt-licm.md` (or in this issue's resolution comment) with concrete numbers and the wast snippet.

### Step 2 (only if Step 1 shows wasm-opt isn't doing it) — codegen-side hoisting

In `src/codegen/statements/loops.ts::compileForStatement`, when the loop condition is of shape `i < <invariant>`, where `<invariant>` is provably loop-invariant (no writes to its dependencies inside the body):

1. Allocate a fresh i32 local
2. Emit `<invariant>` once before the loop, store to the local
3. Replace the loop condition with `i < local.get $tmp`

Pattern detection scope (start narrow, broaden later):
- `arr.length` where `arr` is not assigned inside the body
- A constant or parameter reference (already handled trivially)
- A simple property access on an unmodified ref

More general LICM (hoisting whole expressions) would need a real dataflow analysis — defer to a follow-up.

### Step 3 — extend to `arr[i].length` style chains where applicable

Lower-priority. File as follow-up if Step 2 is impactful.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **If Step 1 finds wasm-opt is already doing LICM**: close with documented verification. Add a note to `plan/notes/wasm-opt-coverage.md` (new file) covering this and other peephole-equivalent things wasm-opt does that we should not duplicate.
2. **If Step 1 finds wasm-opt is NOT doing LICM**: implement Step 2. Acceptance:
   - Hot runtime of `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)` improves measurably even without `--optimize`.
   - With `--optimize`, our codegen-side hoisting must NOT cause wasm-opt to do LICM on a value we already lifted (idempotent — re-hoisting is fine, but must not break).
   - New equivalence test in `tests/issue-1194.test.ts` covering the pattern + non-matching cases (loop body modifies `arr`, body modifies the invariant, etc.).
3. CI test262 net delta ≥ 0; no regressions.

## Out of scope

- General-purpose LICM via dataflow analysis (much bigger change).
- Strength reduction (`for (i = 0; i < n*2; i++)` → `for (i = 0; i < N; i += 2)`-style) — separate issue.
- Loop unrolling — separate concern.

## Risk

Soundness: never hoist if the body might mutate the invariant. Conservative pattern-match (only `arr.length` where `arr` is provably not reassigned and not aliased through other writes) keeps risk low.

If wasm-opt already handles this and we add codegen-side hoisting, we may make the post-opt output slightly larger (an unneeded local). Verify by diffing optimized output before/after.

## Notes

This is the smaller of the two Tier 2 array-perf wins. May reduce to documentation-only if wasm-opt's existing pass covers our common shapes — which is why **Step 1 (measurement) comes first**.

## Resolution (2026-05-03) — Step 1 alone closes this

Step 1 (measurement) done. Findings:

1. **Static**: `wasm-opt -O3` does NOT statically hoist
   `struct.get $vec 0 (local.get $arr)` (vec.length read) out of
   the loop condition. The struct.get stays inside the loop body
   in both `--optimize` and unoptimized binaries. Reason: hoisting
   a potentially-trapping op (struct.get on nullable ref) out of
   a loop that might iterate zero times would change semantics.

2. **Runtime (V8)**: Despite the static "miss", V8's JIT
   compensates. Microbenchmark on a 1M-element array sum:

   | variant | unopt median | -O3 median |
   |---------|--------------|------------|
   | re-eval `arr.length` each iter | 6.51 ms | 6.70 ms |
   | manually hoisted | 6.60 ms | 6.65 ms |

   The difference is within timing noise (≤ 1%). The JIT pulls the
   struct.get out of the loop at compile time.

### Decision: close with documentation, do NOT implement Step 2

Adding codegen-side LICM would:

- require mutation analysis to prove `arr` isn't reassigned in the body
- emit a slightly larger pre-V8 binary (extra local + `local.set`)
- yield zero measurable wall-clock benefit on V8

The smaller-and-equivalent baseline is preferable. See
`plan/notes/wasm-opt-coverage.md` (new, this issue) for the full
write-up — that file is the running record of "things wasm-opt
does / doesn't do that we should / shouldn't duplicate".

Re-open if a non-V8 runtime (Wasmtime, Wasmer, custom interpreter)
shows a meaningful gap on the same shape.
