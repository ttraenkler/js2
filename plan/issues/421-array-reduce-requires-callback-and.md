# #421 — Array.reduce requires callback and initial value (23 CE)

## Problem

23 tests fail with "reduce requires callback and initial value" errors. The compiler does not fully support Array.prototype.reduce and Array.prototype.reduceRight.

Issues include:
- reduce without initial value (should use first element as accumulator)
- Callback type inference for reduce accumulator
- reduceRight not implemented

## Priority: medium (23 tests)

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Array.reduce works with and without initial value
- [ ] Array.reduceRight supported
- [ ] Reduce this CE pattern to zero
