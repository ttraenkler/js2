# #432 — `new` keyword on non-constructor builtins causes stack underflow (42 CE)

## Problem

42 tests fail with:

```
not enough arguments on the stack for call (need 2, got 0)
```

These are tests that use `new` with non-constructor built-in functions. The tests verify that calling `new Math.abs()` throws a TypeError (because Math methods are not constructors). Instead of throwing TypeError, the compiler generates malformed Wasm that fails to validate.

### Affected categories (42 tests)

- All Math built-in `not-a-constructor.js` tests (33 tests: abs, ceil, floor, round, trunc, sign, sqrt, min, max, clz32, imul, pow, exp, log, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2, acosh, asinh, atanh, cbrt, expm1, log1p, log2, log10, fround, hypot x2)
- Expression tests using `new` with computed property functions (9 tests: multiplication, division, modulus, bitwise ops, shifts)

### Sample failing tests

- `test/built-ins/Math/abs/not-a-constructor.js`
- `test/language/expressions/multiplication/S11.5.1_A3_T2.2.js`

### Sample test pattern

```javascript
assert.throws(TypeError, () => { new Math.abs(); });
```

## Root cause

The actual root cause was NOT in `compileNewExpression` — `new Math.ceil()` was already handled correctly by falling through to a `ref.null extern` fallback. The real bug was in the `__module_init` guard preamble injection.

When a module has top-level variable initializers (like `let __fail = 0`), the compiler creates a `__module_init` function and injects a guarded call to it at the start of every exported function. The guard preamble was constructed as a SHARED set of instruction objects:

```javascript
const guardPreamble: Instr[] = [
  { op: "global.get", ... },
  { op: "i32.eqz" },
  { op: "if", then: [
    { op: "call", funcIdx: initFuncIdx },  // SHARED object
  ]},
];
for (func of functions) {
  func.body = [...guardPreamble, ...func.body];  // spreads array but shares objects
}
```

The `...guardPreamble` spread creates new array entries but the `if` instruction (and its nested `then` array with the `call` instruction) remained the SAME JavaScript object shared across all function bodies.

Later, `eliminateDeadImports` removes unused union imports and remaps function indices. When it iterates over function bodies and calls `remapFuncIdxInBody`, it encounters the shared `call` instruction in the first function and remaps it (e.g., from index 20 to 12). Then in the second function, it finds the SAME instruction (now at 12) and remaps it AGAIN (12 to 4). This double-remapping causes the call to target the wrong function — in this case, `assert_notSameValue(f64, f64)` instead of `__module_init()`, hence "need 2, got 0".

## Fix

Create fresh instruction objects for each function's guard preamble, so `eliminateDeadImports` remaps each independently:

```javascript
for (func of functions) {
  if (func.exported) {
    const guardPreamble: Instr[] = [  // fresh for each function
      { op: "global.get", ... },
      { op: "i32.eqz" },
      { op: "if", then: [
        { op: "call", funcIdx: initFuncIdx },
      ]},
    ];
    func.body = [...guardPreamble, ...func.body];
  }
}
```

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Fixed shared instruction objects in guard preamble creation (src/codegen/index.ts)
- Added regression test (tests/equivalence/new-non-constructor.test.ts)

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — moved guardPreamble creation inside the per-function loop
- `tests/equivalence/new-non-constructor.test.ts` — new test file with 3 tests

### What worked
- Root cause analysis through WAT output inspection revealed the double-remap bug
- The fix is minimal (move 8 lines inside a loop) with no behavioral change

### What didn't
- Initial hypothesis was wrong (thought the bug was in `compileNewExpression`)
- The issue only manifests with a specific number of preamble functions due to remap table coincidence
