# #527 — Fix test262 script: use tsx instead of node

## Status: open

`pnpm run test262` fails with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find module '/workspace/tests/test262-runner.js'` because the package.json script uses `node` which can't resolve `.ts` imports.

## Fix

In package.json, change:
```json
"test262": "node scripts/run-test262.ts"
```
to:
```json
"test262": "tsx scripts/run-test262.ts"
```

## Complexity: XS
