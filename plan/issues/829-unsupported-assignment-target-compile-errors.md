# #829 -- Unsupported assignment target compile errors (141 tests)

## Problem

141 tests fail with compile error "Unsupported assignment target". These are tests that assign to complex left-hand-side expressions that the compiler does not recognize. Closely related: 63 tests fail with "Invalid left-hand side in assignment" (TypeScript parser errors for intentionally invalid syntax in negative tests).

## Breakdown

| Pattern | Count | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| "Unsupported assignment target" | 141 | Compiler limitation |
| "Invalid left-hand side in assignment" | 63 | Negative tests - parser correctly rejects |

The 63 "Invalid left-hand side" errors are likely **correct behavior** -- these are negative tests that expect SyntaxError for invalid assignments like `true = 1`. The 141 "Unsupported assignment target" errors are the real issue.

## Sample files (unsupported assignment target)

- test/language/expressions/assignment/target-assignment-inside-function.js
- test/language/expressions/assignment/target-assignment.js
- test/language/expressions/assignment/target-cover-yieldexpr.js
- test/language/expressions/assignment/target-cover-newtarget.js
- test/language/expressions/assignment/target-super-computed.js

## Root cause

In `src/codegen/expressions.ts`, the `compileAssignment` function handles known assignment targets (identifiers, member expressions, destructuring patterns) but misses:

1. Assignments inside cover grammars (parenthesized expressions that become assignment targets)
2. `super[computed]` as assignment target
3. `new.target` related expressions
4. Yield expressions in assignment target position

## Suggested fix

1. In `compileAssignment`, add cases for:
   - Parenthesized assignment targets: unwrap `ParenthesizedExpression` to find the real target
   - `super[computed]` = value: compile as property set on super
   - Other cover grammar forms
2. For the 63 "Invalid left-hand side" cases, verify these are negative tests expecting SyntaxError and handle them as correct compile-time rejections

## Acceptance criteria

- 141 "Unsupported assignment target" compile errors reduced by 80%+
- Valid assignment targets (cover grammars, super computed) compile correctly
