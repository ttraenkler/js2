## Resolution (2026-07-17)

**Already fixed on main** by the intervening any-typed strict-equality / boxed
native-value work (the tag-5 host-only arm — `reference_2583_*` family — was
generalised to a carrier-agnostic path; see #745 S3 `$AnyValue` strict-eq).
Re-verified against current main: the minimal repro and both identity controls
now return `1` under `target: "standalone"`.

Closed by:
- restoring the identity assertions in `tests/issue-3128.test.ts` — the two
  `standaloneSrc` value-only relaxations (the "escaped self-capturing closure"
  and "sibling closure outside the RHS" cases) are removed, so `closureRead()
  === p2` OBJECT-identity now runs on BOTH lanes;
- adding `tests/issue-3136.test.ts` — the exact minimal repro + arrow variant +
  controls (value-flow, no-write, aliasing, mutate-through-cell), on both the
  standalone and js-host lanes.

No host-lane behavior change (guard-only + already-green fix).

# #3136 — standalone cell-read object identity loss

## Problem (minimal repro, `--target standalone`, main 32bae1f48f + #3128 rescue)

```ts
export function test(): number {
  var p2: any;
  var f = function () {
    return p2;
  };
  p2 = { a: 1 };
  if (f() !== p2) return 8; // ← returns 8 in standalone; host returns 1
  return 1;
}
```

No inlined IIFE, no self-capturing RHS — this is NOT #3128 (whose write path
is correct: the VALUE flows, `f().a === 1` passes). When `p2` is promoted to a
ref-cell capture and the closure reads it back, the strict-equality of the
cell-read result against the outer read of the same variable answers FALSE for
the SAME object.

Controls (all pass):

- no write after capture (`var p2: any = {a:1}; var f = () => p2;`) → `f() === p2` true.
- direct aliasing (`var q: any = p2`) → `q === p2` true.
- value flow through the cell (`f().a === 1`) → true.

## Suspect

One side of the comparison goes through a different boxing/conversion than the
other (cell-read → anyref → externref round-trip vs the outer local's
representation) and the `===` lands in the tag-5 host-only arm — same family
as `reference_2583_any_strict_eq_tag5_host_only` and the #3130 note
("identity on $Promise values routed through any-typed vars fails standalone
— seen === p1 false even with no self-capture").

## Impact

- The identity assertions in `tests/issue-3128.test.ts` had to be relaxed to
  value assertions on the standalone lane (`standaloneSrc` variants — grep
  `#3136` there); restore them when this is fixed.
- test262 Promise `resolve-settled-*-self.js` acceptance on the widened
  standalone lane compares self-captured promise identity.

## Acceptance

- The repro above returns 1 under `target: "standalone"`.
- The two `standaloneSrc` variants in `tests/issue-3128.test.ts` are removed
  (identity asserts run on both lanes).
- No host-lane byte diffs.
