# #582 — local.set type mismatch in C_method (84 CE)

## Status: in-review
84 tests fail with `C_method local.set[0] expected type (ref null N), found struct.new of type (ref M)` — the class method's `this` local has the wrong struct type.

### Root cause
When a class method body does `struct.new` (e.g., creating `this` or a child class instance), the result type is a specific struct (ref M) but the local is typed as the parent struct (ref null N). The struct subtyping doesn't match because WasmGC uses nominal types.

The actual root cause is a forward-reference ordering issue: during class collection, all struct types + constructor + method function stubs are registered per-class in source order. When class Foo has a method returning class Bar, but Bar is declared after Foo, the method return type resolves to externref (because Bar's struct type isn't registered yet). Later, the method body produces a `(ref $Bar)` value but the function signature says `externref`, causing a Wasm validation error.

### Wasm error locations
- `Wasm:C_method local.set[0]... (ref null 2)... struct.new (ref 4)` — 48 occurrences
- `Wasm:C_method local.set[0]... (ref null 4)... struct.new (ref 6)` — 36 occurrences

### Fix
Re-resolve function type signatures (params and return types) at body compilation time, when all class struct types are guaranteed to be registered. Applied to constructors, methods, getters, and setters in `compileClassBodies`.

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary
- **What was done**: Added function type re-resolution in `compileClassBodies` for constructors, methods, getters, and setters. At body compilation time, all class struct types are registered, so `resolveWasmType` produces the correct ref types instead of falling back to externref.
- **Files changed**: `src/codegen/index.ts`, `tests/class-method-struct-new.test.ts` (new)
- **What worked**: Re-resolving via `addFuncType` (which deduplicates) and updating `func.typeIdx` when the re-resolved type differs from the stale collection-phase type.
- **Tests**: 4 new tests covering method returning same class, child class, different class, and static factory methods.
