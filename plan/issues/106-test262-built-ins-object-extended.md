# Issue 106: Test262 — built-ins/Object extended + built-ins/Array constructor

## Summary

Add test262 coverage for the extended `Object` static methods and the `Array`
constructor/static methods. These fill the gaps in `built-ins/Object` (currently
only `keys`, `values`, `entries`) and `built-ins/Array` (currently only prototype
methods).

## Categories to add

### built-ins/Object extended

| Category | Method | Status in compiler |
|---|---|---|
| `built-ins/Object/assign` | `Object.assign(target, ...srcs)` | needs impl |
| `built-ins/Object/create` | `Object.create(proto)` | skip (prototype chains) |
| `built-ins/Object/freeze` | `Object.freeze(obj)` | needs impl |
| `built-ins/Object/is` | `Object.is(a, b)` | needs impl |
| `built-ins/Object/prototype/hasOwnProperty` | `obj.hasOwnProperty(k)` | needs impl |
| `built-ins/Object/prototype/toString` | `obj.toString()` | needs impl |

### built-ins/Array constructor + static methods

| Category | Method | Status in compiler |
|---|---|---|
| `built-ins/Array/isArray` | `Array.isArray(v)` | needs impl |
| `built-ins/Array/from` | `Array.from(iterable)` | needs impl |
| `built-ins/Array/of` | `Array.of(...items)` | needs impl |
| `built-ins/Array/prototype/flat` | `arr.flat(depth)` | needs impl |
| `built-ins/Array/prototype/flatMap` | `arr.flatMap(fn)` | needs impl (see flatmap-closure.test.ts) |
| `built-ins/Array/prototype/copyWithin` | `arr.copyWithin(...)` | ✅ done (#72) |
| `built-ins/Array/prototype/fill` | `arr.fill(...)` | ✅ done (#72) |

## Approach

1. Start with `Array.isArray`, `Object.is`, `obj.hasOwnProperty` — small host imports
2. Add `Array.from` with array/iterable input, `Array.of`
3. Add `Object.assign` via host import
4. Skip `Object.create`, `Object.freeze` (require prototype chain support)
5. Add each working category to `TEST_CATEGORIES`
