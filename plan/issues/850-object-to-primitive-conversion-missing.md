# #850 -- Object-to-primitive conversion missing: valueOf/toString not called (135 tests)

## Problem

135 tests fail with "Cannot convert object to primitive value" at runtime. JavaScript's ToPrimitive abstract operation should call `valueOf()` or `toString()` on objects, but our compiler does not invoke these methods when converting objects to primitive values in arithmetic/comparison contexts.

This is classified under `runtime_error` (124 tests) and `other` (11 tests).

### Sample files with exact errors and source

**1. Function + number uses ToPrimitive (L14)**
File: `test/language/expressions/addition/S11.6.1_A2.2_T3.js`
Error: `Cannot convert object to primitive value`
```js
// Lines 11-17:
function f1(){ return 0; }
if (f1 + 1 !== f1.toString() + 1) {
  throw new Test262Error('#1');
}
// Lines 20-24:
function f2(){ return 0; }
f2.valueOf = function() { return 1; };
if (1 + f2 !== 1 + 1) {
  throw new Test262Error('#2');
}
```
Root cause: `f1 + 1` should call `f1.toString()` (returns `"function f1(){ return 0; }"`) and concatenate with "1". `1 + f2` should call `f2.valueOf()` (returns 1) and add. Instead, the compiler tries to convert the function object directly and fails.

**2. Symbol.toPrimitive coerce returns primitive (L5)**
File: `test/language/expressions/addition/coerce-symbol-to-prim-return-prim.js`
Error: `Cannot convert object to primitive value`
Root cause: Objects with `Symbol.toPrimitive` method should have that method called.

**3. Assignment with object valueOf (L14)**
File: `test/language/expressions/assignment/S11.13.1_A7_T4.js`
Error: `Cannot convert object to primitive value`

**4. Class computed property name from arrow function**
File: `test/language/expressions/class/cpn-class-expr-accessors-computed-property-name-from-arrow-function-expression.js`
Error: `Cannot convert object to primitive value`
Root cause: Arrow function used as computed property key -- should call `toString()` on it.

**5. Object valueOf in array methods**
Files: `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/every/15.4.4.16-1-4.js` and similar
Error: `Invalid value used as weak map key` (109 tests, related pattern)
```js
var obj = new Boolean(true);
obj.length = 2;
obj[0] = 11;
Array.prototype.every.call(obj, callbackfn);
```
Root cause: `Array.prototype.every.call(obj, ...)` passes `obj` (a Boolean wrapper) where the compiler tries to store it as a WeakMap key. Wrapper objects should be valid WeakMap keys.

### Related: Invalid WeakMap key (109 tests)

109 additional tests fail with "Invalid value used as weak map key". These are Array.prototype methods (every, filter, forEach, map, some, reduce, indexOf, lastIndexOf) called on non-array objects. The root cause is that the compiler uses a WeakMap internally for property storage, but wrapper objects (Boolean, Number, String objects) are not recognized as valid keys.

### Related: "not iterable" (54 tests)

54 tests fail with "object is not iterable (cannot read property Symbol(Symbol.iterator))". Objects with custom Symbol.iterator should be iterable.

### Related: "Cannot read 'next' of null" (72 tests)

72 tests fail because the iterator protocol returns null from `Symbol.iterator`, when it should return an iterator object with a `next` method.

## Root cause in compiler

In `src/codegen/expressions.ts` and `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts`:

1. **ToPrimitive not implemented**: When coercing an object to a primitive (for arithmetic, comparison, template literals), the compiler should:
   - Check for `Symbol.toPrimitive` method and call it
   - Else check for `valueOf()` and call it
   - Else check for `toString()` and call it
   Instead, the compiler emits a direct externref -> f64 or externref -> string conversion that fails for objects.

2. **WeakMap key validation**: Wrapper objects (Boolean, Number, String) should be valid WeakMap keys because they are objects. The compiler rejects them because it uses the unwrapped primitive value.

3. **Symbol.iterator protocol**: Custom iterables with `[Symbol.iterator]()` methods are not recognized.

## Suggested fix

1. In `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts`:
   - Implement ToPrimitive as a host import or inline sequence:
     - Check `Symbol.toPrimitive` -> call with hint
     - Check `valueOf` -> call
     - Check `toString` -> call
   - Use for all object-to-primitive coercions

2. In `src/codegen/expressions.ts`:
   - For WeakMap operations, accept any object (including wrapper objects) as keys
   - For iteration, check `Symbol.iterator` property and call it to get iterator

## Acceptance criteria

- `obj + 1` calls `obj.valueOf()` or `obj.toString()` as appropriate
- Wrapper objects (new Boolean, new Number, new String) usable as WeakMap keys
- >=100 of 135 "Cannot convert" tests fixed
- >=80 of 109 "Invalid weak map key" tests fixed

## Resolution

**Fixed by #866** (ToPrimitive host import + type-coercion.ts changes). Verification scan (2026-03-29):
- Addition/ToPrimitive tests: 5 pass, 0 ToPrimitive errors (of 6 sampled)
- Array.prototype.every with non-array objects: 15 pass, 0 WeakMap key errors (of 16 sampled)
- All 4 sample files from the issue description now pass

The `_toPrimitive` function in runtime.ts and `emitToPrimitiveMethodExports` in index.ts handle valueOf/toString dispatch for WasmGC structs via sidecar properties and Wasm-exported struct getters.
