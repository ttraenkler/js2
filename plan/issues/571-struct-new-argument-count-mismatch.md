# #571 -- struct.new argument count mismatch (231 CE)

## Status: in-review
231 tests fail Wasm validation because `struct.new` is called with the wrong number of arguments. This is residual from #516 which fixed the initial class constructor struct.new argument count.

The root cause: struct types can have fields dynamically added during compilation (at four sites in `expressions.ts`), but existing `struct.new` instructions emitted for those types are not updated. When the module is validated, struct.new expects N arguments (matching the final field count) but only M < N values were pushed.

## Dynamic field addition sites patched

1. **Logical assignment property access** (~line 6876): When a logical assignment like `obj.prop ||= val` encounters a property not yet in the struct, it adds the field dynamically.

2. **Compound assignment property access** (~line 7760): Same pattern for compound assignment `obj.prop += val`.

3. **Property access fallback** (~line 15283): When accessing `obj.prop` and the field is not found in the struct but exists in the TS type, it auto-registers the field.

4. **Computed property fields** (`ensureComputedPropertyFields`): When computed property keys add new fields to an already-registered struct type.

## Fix

Added `patchStructNewForAddedField()` function that, when a field is dynamically added to a struct type, walks all compiled function bodies and inserts a default value instruction before every `struct.new` targeting that type. Called at all four dynamic field addition sites.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added `patchStructNewForAddedField(ctx, fctx, typeIdx, fieldType)` function in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`
- The function walks all function bodies (compiled functions, current function body, saved bodies) and inserts a default value instruction before every `struct.new` instruction targeting the affected struct type
- Called at all four sites where struct types have fields dynamically added
- Added `fctx` parameter to `ensureComputedPropertyFields` for proper patching
- Added regression test in `tests/equivalence/struct-new-dynamic-field.test.ts`

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` - Added patchStructNewForAddedField, patched 4 dynamic field addition sites
- `tests/equivalence/struct-new-dynamic-field.test.ts` - New test file
- `plan/issues/sprints/0/571.md` - This issue file

### Tests passing
- All existing equivalence tests continue to pass (same pass/fail as before)
- New struct-new-dynamic-field tests pass

## Complexity: M
