# #925 — Landing page: integrate test262 conformance circle and ECMAScript edition timeline

## Problem

The "JavaScript Compatible" section on the landing page shows only text stats (40.8%, 17.5k+). It should include visual diagrams that make the conformance data immediately compelling:

1. **Conformance circle diagram** — donut/ring chart showing test262 pass/fail/CE/skip breakdown. Should read from `benchmarks/results/test262-report.json` at runtime so it stays current.

2. **ECMAScript edition timeline** — horizontal timeline showing which ES editions are supported (ES5, ES2015, ES2016, ..., ES2025) with visual indicators of coverage level per edition. Data can be derived from test262 category breakdown in the report.

## Requirements

1. Both diagrams must match the landing page dark theme and design language (purple/indigo palette, clean lines, subtle glow effects)
2. Conformance circle should show: pass % prominently in center, colored segments for pass/fail/CE/skip
3. Timeline should show ES edition badges with fill level or checkmarks indicating support
4. Both should be responsive (mobile-friendly)
5. Data loaded from `test262-report.json` — not hardcoded
6. Pure CSS/SVG/JS — no chart library dependencies
7. Placed in the stats section near the existing 40.8% / 17.5k+ / 48k numbers

## Acceptance criteria

- Circle diagram renders with correct pass rate from live data
- Timeline shows ES edition coverage levels
- Style matches landing page (dark bg, purple accents, clean typography)
- Works on mobile viewports
- No external dependencies added
