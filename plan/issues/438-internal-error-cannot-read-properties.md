# #438 -- Internal error: Cannot read properties of undefined in expression compilation (20 CE)

## Problem

20 tests fail with "Internal error compiling expression: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ...)" -- a JavaScript TypeError thrown inside the compiler itself during expression compilation.

This indicates the codegen is accessing a property on a value it expects to exist but which is undefined. Common causes:
- Looking up a variable binding that was never registered
- Accessing .type or .kind on an AST node that is unexpectedly null
- Dereferencing a struct type that was not resolved

## Priority: medium (20 tests)

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Identify and fix the specific undefined property accesses
- [ ] Add null guards or proper error messages for unresolvable references
- [ ] CE count for this internal error pattern reduced to near zero
