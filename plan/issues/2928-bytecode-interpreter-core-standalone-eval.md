# #2928 — Bytecode interpreter core + standalone `new Function` / indirect eval

Slice **E** of the runtime-eval roadmap
([docs/architecture/runtime-eval-interpreter.md](../../docs/architecture/runtime-eval-interpreter.md), §6-E).
The WasmGC-native bytecode interpreter — #1584 Phase 1 core. Delivers the first
**standalone** dynamic-code execution: `new Function(dynamicBody)` and indirect
`(0, eval)(s)`, both **global-scope only** (no lexical capture — that is #2929).

## Scope

Global-scope evaluation only, deliberately excluding direct-eval scope capture
(§4.1 / #2929) so this slice needs no environment reification.

1. **Opcode-set ADR** under `docs/adr/` — register+accumulator design (after
   V8 Ignition; rationale: fewer opcodes/op than stack-based, Wasm-locals map to
   virtual registers). ~30 opcodes for Phase 1: arithmetic (with ToPrimitive),
   property `Get`/`Set`, `Call`/`Construct`/`CallMethod`, variable access
   (`LdLocal`/`StLocal`/`LdGlobal`/`StGlobal`), control flow
   (`Jump`/`JumpIfTrue`/`JumpIfFalse`/`Throw`/`TryStart`/`TryEnd`),
   `CallBuiltin <id>`. Document encoding, operand widths, exception-table format.
   Builds on the **#1715** IR→bytecode proof point (done) and the **#1713**
   backend trait seam.
2. **Bytecode emitter** as a second IR backend, gated by a per-function
   may-contain-dynamic flag; walks the same IR the WasmGC backend walks. Bytecode
   stored as a WasmGC array on a function-metadata struct (+ constant pool,
   exception table).
3. **Dispatch loop** authored in the js2wasm-compilable TS subset, compiled by
   js2wasm, with hot-path variables strictly typed (`number` PC, typed struct
   refs for frame/constant-pool) to avoid interpreter-level boxing. Inspect the
   generated WasmGC and note any hot-path boxing in the ADR.
4. **Bidirectional call protocol** — AOT function ↔ interpreted function, **zero
   marshalling**, boxed-value identity preserved (`ref.eq`, roadmap §4.2).
5. **Exception propagation** across the AOT↔interpreter boundary via Wasm EH
   tags (both paths already use EH).
6. Wire `new Function(dynamicBody)` and `(0, eval)(dynamicString)` (indirect) to
   parse via the #2927 Acorn artifact → emit bytecode → run the dispatch loop,
   in **standalone** mode.

## Value-rep (crux) & global access

- `JSValue` = the AOT `$Object` substrate (free bridge — see #2927 / roadmap
  §4.2). `CallBuiltin` targets the generic built-in siblings the #2927 audit
  guarantees.
- Global access: `var`/`function` hoist as properties on the module global
  environment record (globalThis `$Object`, #369), visible to AOT code and vice
  versa (roadmap §4.3). Indirect eval / `new Function` are **always** this
  global scope.

## Non-goals (this slice)

- Direct-eval scope capture → #2929.
- Generator/async opcodes → #2929 (align with #2864/#2865).
- Tier-up (re-AOT-compile hot interpreted functions) → deferred.
- V8/SpiderMonkey-grade throughput — this is the fallback path.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `new Function("a","b","return a+b")(1,2) === 3` in **standalone** mode via
      the interpreter (dynamic body, no host).
- [ ] `(0, eval)("1 + 2") === 3` in standalone mode (indirect eval).
- [ ] `eval("throw new Error('x')")` propagates through the AOT↔interpreter
      boundary into a catching `try/catch`.
- [ ] An AOT function calls an interpreted function and vice versa with identical
      boxed-value identity (a `ref.eq` round-trip test).
- [ ] ≥ 30 test262 eval-positive / Function-positive cases pass under the
      standalone target.
- [ ] A no-eval module stays within 5% of the current size floor; an
      eval-enabled module documents one measured parser+interpreter size figure.
- [ ] Opcode-set ADR committed under `docs/adr/`.

## Notes

Depends on #2927 (parser + generic built-ins). Umbrella: #1584. Goal:
`runtime-eval`.

## Implementation Plan (architect, 2026-07-04)

Authoritative architecture: `docs/architecture/runtime-eval-interpreter.md`
**Part II (§12–§16)** — the 4-tier ladder + routing rules (§12), the
**bytecode-over-tree-walking ADR** (§13, decided: register+accumulator
bytecode; tree-walking rejected with rationale — do not relitigate without
new evidence), the unified name-resolution semantics (§14), the
compiled-acorn feasibility verdict (§15), and this slice sequence (§16).

### Root cause / why this exists

Standalone mode has **zero** dynamic-code execution: every dynamic
`eval`/`new Function` call site is Tier-3 today (#2960: compile warning +
catchable call-time throw — correct diagnostics, no capability). This issue
builds Tier 2 so standalone routes dynamic global-scope code to a real
executor. Direct-eval scope capture is explicitly NOT here (→ #2929).

### Two producers, one bytecode (design constraint — read before the ADR)

The original wording "bytecode emitter as a second IR backend" conflated two
producers (doc §12.1): **(a)** the *runtime* emitter, ESTree→bytecode,
authored in TS, compiled into the module — that is THIS issue; **(b)** the
*build-time* IR→bytecode backend (#1715 proof) as a future AOT deopt target
for `with`-class features — NOT built here, but the opcode ADR must not
preclude it (opcodes take boxed-any operands, carry no "parsed-at-runtime"
assumptions).

### Slices (each independently landable; sizes in doc §16)

**E0 (S) — in-Wasm AST consumer probe.** Small TS walker compiled alongside
Acorn (extend the #1710 harness, `tests/dogfood/`): call `parse` and walk the
resulting AST **inside Wasm** (dynamic `$Object` field reads), return
node-count / spot-field scalars. Purpose: arbitrate whether #2841/#2851/#2852
(params/quasis/sequence-children blank) are host-marshalling-only — if the
fields are intact in-Wasm, they leave this issue's critical path. Unblocked
now (post-#2937).

**P1/P2 (M each) — the #2853 parser blockers.** A: division after a numeric
literal mis-tokenized as regex start (`1 / 2` throws — likely a js2wasm
miscompile of acorn's token-context update, root-cause in the compiler); B:
any regex group `(…)` throws in `validateRegExpPattern` (suspected
#1690-family global-array typing). Both gate E2 wiring, neither gates E1.
(#2850's surviving half folds into P2.)

**E1 (L) — interpreter library, developed in Node.** New top-level source
dir (suggest `src/interp/`, kept import-clean of compiler internals so it
self-compiles): opcode definitions + encoder + ESTree→bytecode emitter +
dispatch loop + `$Frame`/env-record types + a disassembler. Authored in the
strictly-typed js2wasm-compilable TS subset (typed i32 PC, typed arrays for
registers; boxed-any only for JS values), but **unit-tested in Node against
node-acorn** over a fixture corpus of eval bodies — no Wasm involved. Write
the opcode ADR to `docs/adr/` (register+accumulator, ~30 Phase-1 opcodes per
the Scope list; i32-array bytecode + boxed-any constant pool + side exception
table of `[tryStart, tryEnd, handlerPC]`; `$Frame = {meta, pc, regs, envRec,
parent}`, hot fields cached in Wasm locals inside the loop). Runs fully in
parallel with E0/P1/P2 — it has **no compiled-acorn dependency**.

**E2 (L) — self-compile + standalone dynamic `new Function`.** Compile the
E1 library through js2wasm into the emitted module, gated per-module by a
may-contain-dynamic flag (the call-site classifier from
`eval-inline.ts`/`calls.ts` already distinguishes constant vs dynamic — reuse
it; a module with no dynamic sites must be byte-identical to today). Replace
the #2960 Tier-3 call-time-throwing stub for `new Function(<dynamic>)`
(`src/codegen/expressions/new-super.ts`) under standalone/wasi with: Acorn
parse → emit → a callable closing over the bytecode + module global env,
entering the dispatch loop. Global scope only (§20.2.1.1). Every gap where
js2wasm can't compile the E1 library is filed under #1058 (this is the
self-host stress test working as intended). Author E1/E2 to compile cleanly
through the **IR front-end** where possible (per the #2927 IR-alignment
note).

**E3 (M) — indirect eval + global hoisting.** `(0,eval)(<dynamic>)`
standalone via the same pipeline (`calls.ts` fall-through, replacing the
Tier-3 throw); `var`/`function` in evaluated code hoist as properties on the
globalThis `$Object` (#369), visible to AOT code and vice versa (doc §14 /
§4.3). `LdGlobal`/`StGlobal` are the root-only case of the §14 resolution
walk; a root miss throws `ReferenceError` (typed, catchable).

**E4 (M) — exception bridging.** `Throw`/`TryStart`/`TryEnd` + Wasm EH-tag
propagation across the AOT↔interpreter boundary in both directions
(interpreted `throw` caught by AOT `try/catch` and vice versa).

**E5 (M–L) — CallBuiltin.** Unified `CallBuiltin(name, recv, argsVec)`
targeting the #2927-audited surface (`__extern_method_call` open-`$Object`
path, `__get_builtin`, `__call_m_*` + brand arms, `__str_*`/`__vec_*`).
Prerequisite gap slices (from the #2927 audit — each landable alone, shared
with standalone AOT any-receiver work, NOT interpreter-only): **G1** Map/Set
`ref.test` brand arms in the closed-method dispatcher (turnkey — mirrors the
landed #2927 push/pop arm; route to `map-runtime.ts`/`set-runtime.ts`
helpers); **G2** args-passing on the standalone generic path
(`emitWrapperDynamicMethodCall` `wantArgs`) + `__apply_closure` arity>4 lift;
**G3** array callback methods host-free (in-Wasm callback bridge replacing
`env.__make_callback`); **G4** `string[]` carrier in `__vec_push`/`__vec_pop`
(#2784). G1/G2 are hard prerequisites; G3/G4 degrade gracefully (those calls
throw a clear "not supported" until landed).

**E6 (M) — packaging.** Interpreter+Acorn as a separately-compiled module
linked on demand via #2527 canonical rec-groups (zero-copy `$Object` share);
a no-eval module keeps the size floor (acceptance already lists 5%); record
one measured size figure for an eval-enabled module.

### Edge cases (Phase 1)

- `new Function` body with a `SyntaxError` → throw `SyntaxError` at
  construction time (runtime parse — unlike Tier 0's compile-time error).
- Param-string flatten (`"a", "b,c"`) per §20.2.1.1.1 — same rule #2924
  implements for Tier 0; share the splitter.
- Caller-local name in a `Function` body → resolves global / throws
  `ReferenceError`, NEVER the caller binding (§14 strictness note; #2924's
  no-capture invariant, now enforced by rooting the env chain at global).
- Interpreted code calling an AOT-exported function and vice versa: boxed
  values cross with `ref.eq` identity intact (acceptance test exists).
- Re-entrancy: eval'd code calling `eval` (nested parse/emit while a frame is
  live) — the emitter must be re-entrant; no module-level mutable scratch.
- `arguments`/`this` inside a dynamic `Function` body: sloppy-mode `this` at
  a bare call is `globalThis` (§10.4.3) — the interpreter CAN provide this
  (unlike the Tier-0 splice, which bails on `this` for exactly this reason).

### Milestone order within this issue

E0 → (P1 ∥ P2 ∥ E1) → E2 → (E3 ∥ E4 ∥ E5) → E6. Recommend landing E0+E1 in
one budget window (no substrate risk), E2 in its own (the self-compile is the
risk concentration), E3–E6 as follow-on M slices. #2929 (direct eval, `with`,
MOP, generators) starts only after E3/E4/E5.

### Risks / conflicts

- **Substrate races:** E2+ consume the boxed-any dynamic reader — land after,
  not racing, in-flight value-rep work (roadmap §8 discipline).
- **File conflicts:** `calls.ts`/`new-super.ts` are hot files (eval routing,
  #2960 landed there); rebase early and often. `closed-method-dispatch.ts`
  (G1/G2) is active #2151-family territory.
- **Late-import funcIdx shifts** when reserving interpreter entry helpers —
  follow the name-based repoint discipline (memory: `reference_2193`,
  `project_standalone_hostimport_gate_index_shift`); reserve helpers at the
  call site like the #2927 push/pop fix did.
- **Size:** compiled Acorn alone is 651 KB — E6 (#2527 linking) is what keeps
  the no-eval floor; do not inline the interpreter unconditionally even as an
  interim step for CI's standalone-floor gate.
