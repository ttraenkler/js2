origin: "2026-06-18 sprint-63 standalone harvest (sdev-harvest): re-bucketed the fresh standalone baseline JSONL. The `-1` string-global sentinel CE class (#51) has a 155-test residual on main, all in object-literal data/method property keys (the accessor-key arm was fixed in #1888 S5c but the sibling PropertyAssignment + MethodDeclaration arms were not)."

# #2194 — standalone object-literal data/method property keys bake the `-1` string-global sentinel into `global.get`

## Problem

In `--target standalone` (`nativeStrings` / `ctx.standalone`), there is **no
host string-constant global** — `addStringConstantGlobal(ctx, name)` records the
`-1` sentinel in `ctx.stringGlobalMap` rather than a real import-global index
(this is the #51 / #1888 class). A subsequent literal `{ op: "global.get",
index: keyGlobal }` therefore emits `global.get -1`, which serializes to a
`Codegen error: global index out of range — -1` binary-emit failure.

`#1888 S5c` fixed the **accessor** arm in
`compileObjectLiteralWithAccessors` (`src/codegen/literals.ts`) to materialize
the key via the dual-mode helper `stringConstantExternrefInstrs(ctx, propName)`.
The two sibling arms in the **same loop** were left on the raw
`global.get keyGlobal`:

- **PropertyAssignment** arm — **already fixed on upstream/main via #51** (an
  identical `stringConstantExternrefInstrs` conversion landed in the commits
  after this branch's fork base; resolved as a no-op merge here).
- **MethodDeclaration** arm (`literals.ts`, the `{ greet(){}, get v(){} }`
  shape) — **STILL on the raw `global.get keyGlobal` on upstream/main**; this is
  the genuine remaining defect this PR fixes.

So any object literal that takes the accessor path (i.e. contains ≥1
getter/setter) AND also has a data property or a regular method emits
`global.get -1` for the data/method key. This is why the failure shows up under
`__anon_0_<method>` / `__module_init` (the literal construction site), not in
the getter callback.

### Minimal repro (standalone)

```ts
const o = { index: 0, get val() { return this.index; } };
let x: any = (o as any).val;
// → Binary emit error: global index out of range — -1 at '__module_init'
```

```ts
const obj = { make() { return { index: 0, get val() { return this.index; } }; } };
let it: any = (obj as any).make();
// → ... at '__anon_0_make'
```

Removing the data property (`{ get val() { return 1; } }`) makes it pass —
the getter alone is fine (already-fixed accessor arm), but the sibling `index`
data key trips the unguarded `global.get`.

## Root cause

`literals.ts` PropertyAssignment + MethodDeclaration arms push a raw
`global.get <stringGlobalMap.get(name)>`, where in standalone that value is the
`-1` sentinel. The fix is identical to the accessor arm: emit the key via
`stringConstantExternrefInstrs(ctx, name)`, which lowers to the native-string
inline path under standalone and the host `global.get` under GC.

## Fix

Replace, in both arms, the pair
```ts
addStringConstantGlobal(ctx, name);
const keyGlobal = ctx.stringGlobalMap.get(name);
if (keyGlobal === undefined) continue;
fctx.body.push({ op: "local.get", index: objLocal });
fctx.body.push({ op: "global.get", index: keyGlobal });
```
with
```ts
addStringConstantGlobal(ctx, name);
fctx.body.push({ op: "local.get", index: objLocal });
for (const instr of stringConstantExternrefInstrs(ctx, name)) fctx.body.push(instr);
```

`stringConstantExternrefInstrs` (per `reference_string_global_sentinel_guard`)
emits the guarded dual-mode key under both backends and is byte-identical to the
old `global.get` in GC mode. No late-import-shift interaction (it does not
capture a funcIdx).

## Acceptance criteria

- The minimal repros above compile clean in `--target standalone`.
- The object-literal **method-key** subcluster of the `global index out of
  range — -1` residual clears. Measured against current upstream/main (which
  already carries #51's PropertyAssignment-arm fix): the MethodDeclaration-arm
  fix in this PR flips **18 / 155** standalone CE bucket files
  CE→compiles-clean, and upstream-without-this-PR flips **0 / 155** of them —
  i.e. this bucket is dominated by object literals with named/computed
  **methods** (iterators `[Symbol.iterator](){…}` / `next()`, set-like classes,
  async-from-sync) that contain a getter, so the method-arm is the load-bearing
  fix. The remaining 137 hit the same sentinel class in *other* emit sites —
  see Follow-up.
- No host/GC-mode regression (`stringConstantExternrefInstrs` is byte-identical
  to the old `global.get` in GC mode; verified — the object-literal /
  getter/setter / accessor suites that pass on baseline still pass, and the only
  pre-existing failures (`getters-setters.test.ts` `string_constants` harness
  issue, `issue-1888` 2-4-arg dispatch) fail identically with and without this
  change).
- HW floor not breached (no breach of 20,706/20,803 standalone pass HW).

## Follow-up (broader #51 / sentinel sweep — NOT in this PR)

The 155-test `global index out of range — -1` bucket is a multi-site #51-family
residual. This PR fixes only the **object-literal data/method-key** arm in
`literals.ts` (the accessor arm was already fixed in #1888 S5c). The remaining
~138 hit raw `global.get <stringGlobalMap.get(key)>` in other standalone-reachable
emit sites, each needing the same `stringConstantExternrefInstrs` conversion but
with per-site stack-type verification:

- `object-ops.ts` — `emitDefinePropertyFlagCheck` (flag-key + TypeError message
  globals) **and** the `Object.defineProperty` value-store key path
  (`emitExternDefinePropertyValue` / `markRuntimeDefinedProperty`); the
  `{ value: v }` descriptor still emits `global.get -1` after the flag-check fix,
  so the defineProperty path needs a complete audit, not a partial one.
- `string-ops.ts` (`global.get stringGlobalMap.get(word|"null"|"undefined")`),
- `class-bodies.ts` (`subNameGlobal` / `parentNameGlobal`),
- `binary-ops.ts:742`, `array-methods.ts:5112-5113`, `object-ops.ts:3650`.

Recommend a dedicated follow-up issue (a systematic `global.get`-of-string-global
audit across `src/codegen/*.ts` under `ctx.standalone`) rather than folding it
into this focused PR — each site is mechanically identical but the stack-type and
GC-mode verification per site is what makes it broad-blast-radius.

## Follow-up landed (2026-06-19, sd2) — object-literal METHOD body leaked `__make_getter_callback` standalone

The key-sentinel PR #1710 (merged) fixed the **key** emit for the
PropertyAssignment + MethodDeclaration arms. While re-probing the same
accessor-path object-literal codegen on current main, found a **second,
distinct** standalone defect in the *method-body* compilation (orthogonal to the
key sentinel — the key was already host-free):

**An object literal mixing a regular method with a getter/setter leaked the
`env::__make_getter_callback` host import in `--target standalone`.** Probe on
main:

| literal shape | env import (standalone) |
|---|---|
| `{ get id() {…} }` | (none) ✓ |
| `{ tag: 7, get id() {…} }` (data + getter, #2194 key fix) | (none) ✓ |
| `{ describe() {…}, get id() {…} }` (method + getter) | **`__make_getter_callback`** ✗ |

**Root cause** (`src/codegen/literals.ts`, `compileObjectLiteralWithAccessors`):
the getter/setter arm routes through `emitObjectLiteralAccessorFn`, which is
standalone-aware (#1888 S5b) — host-free `compileArrowAsClosure` under
`ctx.standalone`. But the **three sibling MethodDeclaration arms** (well-known
Symbol-key, runtime-computed-key, string/identifier-key) called
`compileArrowAsCallback(prop, { needsThis: true })` **unconditionally**.
`needsThis: true` selects the `__make_getter_callback` JS bridge
(`closures.ts:2961` `makeCallbackName = needsThis ? "__make_getter_callback" :
"__make_callback"`), an `env::` host import — so a method on an accessor-path
literal imported the bridge even in pure-Wasm mode.

**Fix:** new `emitObjectLiteralMethodFn` mirroring `emitObjectLiteralAccessorFn`
— standalone → host-free `compileArrowAsClosure` (→ externref); GC / JS-host →
the unchanged `compileArrowAsCallback(... needsThis)` bridge. The three method
arms now route through it. The standalone method closure is dispatched via the
same `__current_this`-bound closure-call path the getter closures already use,
so `this` binds correctly. GC mode is unchanged (same `compileArrowAsCallback`).

**Verified** (`tests/issue-2194-objlit-method-host-leak.test.ts`, 6 cases, all
standalone, asserting BOTH zero `env` imports AND correct `this`-bound runtime
values): getter-sibling still works; method reads `this` data (7); `this`-mutating
method sees mutation (2); computed-key method (9); iterator-shaped `next()` method
+ getter (0); method-only-no-getter regression guard (4). The 4 existing
`issue-2194-objlit-key-sentinel` cases stay green; `accessor-side-effects` +
`object-literals` suites green (37). `tsc --noEmit` clean; prettier + biome clean.
The two pre-existing failures (`issue-1888` 2-4-arg dispatch; the
`object-*-getters-setters` / `object-define-property-accessors` `./helpers.js`
harness-load errors) fail **identically** on `origin/main` with and without this
change — not regressions.

**Out of this slice (separate orthogonal standalone leaks, noted not fixed):**
- A `[Symbol.iterator]()`/well-known-Symbol **computed method key** still pulls in
  `env::__box_symbol` (the well-known-symbol key-boxing path, `literals.ts:548`) —
  independent of the method-body bridge fixed here.
- The broader 137-test `-1` string-global sentinel sweep across other emit sites
  (above) remains; many of those sites are already `< 0`-guarded on current main
  (`class-bodies.ts`, the `defineProperty` value path probed clean), so the live
  residual is smaller than the original 155 tally and needs a fresh
  baseline-diff bucket count before a dedicated sweep issue.
