# #915 -- Add CONTRIBUTING.md with the minimum safe contributor workflow

## Problem

A new collaborator currently has to infer the safe development loop from scattered scripts and repo conventions.

That creates uncertainty around:

- how to set up the project
- which commands are required before opening a PR
- how to run focused compiler tests
- how to add a regression for a bugfix
- what coding/cleanup expectations apply

## Goal

Publish a concise `CONTRIBUTING.md` that turns the repo from a solo-workbench feel into a project with a predictable collaborator workflow.

## Requirements

1. Document the minimum local loop:
   - install
   - typecheck
   - lint
   - focused tests
2. Explain how to add or update regression tests
3. Explain how to work with plan/issues when scoping a change
4. State expectations for code cleanup and generated artifacts
5. Keep the file short enough that contributors actually read it

## Acceptance criteria

- the repo has a contributor guide linked from the README
- a new engineer can discover the minimum safe workflow without asking the maintainer directly
- contributor friction is reduced for first PRs
