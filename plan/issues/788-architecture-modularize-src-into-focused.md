# Architecture: modularize src/ into focused subfolder structure

## Problem

The `src/` root currently has 9 loose `.ts` files alongside 7 subfolders. Several root-level files (compiler.ts at 2,213 lines, runtime.ts at 506 lines, import-resolver.ts at 397 lines) are large and handle multiple concerns. The codegen/ subfolder alone is 56K lines with `expressions.ts` at 17,900 lines and `index.ts` at 14,226 lines. This flat structure makes it hard to:

- Understand what depends on what
- Work on one subsystem without touching others
- Onboard new contributors
- Run targeted tests or builds

## Current structure

```

## Proposed target structure

**Principle**: `src/` root has ONLY `index.ts`. Everything else goes into subfolders grouped by concern. Files that don't depend on each other go in separate subfolders.

```

    └── index.ts              — WIT generator (from wit-generator.ts)
```

## Key changes

1. **Root cleanup**: Move all 9 loose files into subfolders. Only `index.ts` remains at root.
2. **compiler/ subfolder**: Groups the pipeline-related files (compiler, resolve, import-resolver, treeshake) that form the compilation orchestration layer.
3. **codegen/ internal split**: The massive `expressions.ts` (17.9K) and `index.ts` (14.2K) need internal decomposition. Extract context types, split expression compilation by category, group built-in methods.
4. **Standalone subfolders**: `optimize.ts`, `wit-generator.ts`, `shape-inference.ts` each move to their own subfolder since they have no cross-dependencies with root peers.
5. **No breaking API changes**: `src/index.ts` continues to re-export the same public API.

## Implementation approach

This should be done incrementally to avoid merge conflicts with active feature work:

### Phase 1: Move root files into subfolders (low risk)
- Create `cli/`, `compiler/`, `analysis/`, `optimize/`, `runtime/` (expand), `wit/`
- Move files, update import paths
- Verify `src/index.ts` re-exports still work

### Phase 2: Split codegen/expressions.ts (high value)
- Extract call expressions, assignment expressions, template literals into separate files
- Extract `FunctionContext` and `CompileContext` types into `codegen/core/context.ts`
- Group built-in methods into `codegen/builtins/`

### Phase 3: Split codegen/index.ts (high value)
- Separate struct/type generation from function compilation
- Extract import handling into its own module

## Risks

- **Merge conflicts**: Active feature branches will conflict with path changes. Best done during a quiet period or as a dedicated sprint.
- **Circular dependencies**: Some files may have bidirectional imports. These need to be broken with interface extraction or dependency inversion.
- **expressions.ts split complexity**: The 17.9K file likely has internal coupling that makes splitting non-trivial. Needs careful dependency analysis first.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `src/` root contains only `index.ts`
- [ ] No file exceeds ~3,000 lines (split larger ones)
- [ ] Files that don't depend on each other are in separate subfolders
- [ ] All existing tests pass with no changes to test files
- [ ] Public API (`src/index.ts` exports) unchanged
- [ ] No circular dependencies between subfolders
