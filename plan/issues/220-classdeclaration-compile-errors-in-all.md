# #220 -- ClassDeclaration compile errors in all statement positions

## Status: in-review
## Summary
686+ test262 compile errors from "Unsupported statement: ClassDeclaration". Sprint 1 (#150) added
`compileNestedClassDeclaration` support but guarded it with `&& stmt.name`, causing anonymous
class declarations to fall through to the unsupported statement error. The guard should be removed
so that ClassDeclaration is handled in ALL statement positions regardless of whether it has a name.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- remove `&& stmt.name` guard from ClassDeclaration check in
  `compileStatementInner`

## Complexity
XS

## Implementation notes
- Removed `&& stmt.name` guard from ClassDeclaration check in `compileStatementInner` (line 262)
- `compileNestedClassDeclaration` already handles `!decl.name` gracefully with an early return
- Anonymous class declarations without `default` are rejected by TypeScript itself before reaching codegen
- All 86 equivalence tests pass with no regressions

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `ts.isClassDeclaration(stmt)` handled without requiring `stmt.name`
- [x] Anonymous class declarations do not produce "Unsupported statement" errors
- [x] No regressions in equivalence tests
