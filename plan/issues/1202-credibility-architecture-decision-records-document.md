# #1202 — Architecture Decision Records

## Problem

js2wasm makes a set of non-obvious architectural choices that a skilled external engineer
will immediately question: Why WasmGC instead of linear memory? Why AOT instead of JIT?
Why closed-world type inference rather than gradual typing? Why not an interpreter?

Today these choices live in the maintainer's head. There is no document an external
contributor or reviewer can read to understand the decision boundary, the alternatives
considered, and why the current approach was chosen. This makes every architectural
discussion start from scratch and reduces the credibility of the project as a
serious engineering artefact.

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are a lightweight, standard format for capturing
exactly this information. They are not design documents — they are retrospective records
of decisions already made, with the context and consequences documented.

### ADRs to write

**ADR-001 — Hybrid static–dynamic compilation strategy**

The foundational strategy ADR. All other ADRs are sub-decisions within this frame:

- Context: Compiling JS to Wasm creates a fundamental tension. JavaScript defines
  runtime behavior; TypeScript types are unsound and erased. A purely dynamic
  compilation (all values boxed) is correct but slow. A purely static compilation
  (trust types, no fallback) is fast but unsound under JavaScript semantics. A hybrid
  strategy is needed that preserves full JS semantics while enabling aggressive
  optimization where safe.
- Decision: Adopt closed-world specialization guided by whole-program analysis (not
  TypeScript annotations), with boundary guards at all dynamic/unknown boundaries, and
  dynamic fallback representations where invariants cannot be proven. Concretely:
  1. Within a compilation unit, perform whole-program control-flow, call-graph, and
     value-flow analysis to infer value types and object shapes. Only proven invariants
     are used for specialization.
  2. Lower stable structures to Wasm GC struct types, unboxed primitives (f64, i32),
     and typed arrays. If invariants cannot be proven, use dynamic (boxed) representation.
  3. At all boundaries between compiled code and dynamic/untyped JS, insert boundary
     thunks that validate/normalize values according to JS semantics. TypeScript
     annotations seed the analysis as constraints, not ground truth.
  4. Dynamic features (eval, dynamic property access, reflection) force fallback to
     boxed representations or separately compiled units, but do not invalidate
     specialization in unrelated proven regions.
  5. When multiple compilation units are visible, link-time optimization may eliminate
     redundant boundary thunks where both sides are known.
- Consequences (positive): full JS semantics preserved; high performance in common
  cases; specialization is localized so dynamic behavior doesn't infect static regions.
- Consequences (negative): dual representations (boxed + unboxed) increase compiler
  complexity; requires shape inference, escape analysis, and careful boundary handling.
- Alternatives rejected: fully dynamic (correct but slow); fully static/trust-types
  (unsound under JS); TypeScript-driven lowering (TS is unsound and erased);
  restricted language subset (breaks JS compatibility).

**ADR-002 — Architectural approach: AOT+WasmGC over embed-a-runtime and new-language alternatives**

The most foundational project-level decision — what kind of compiler are we building?

- Context: Three broad architectural strategies exist for running JavaScript in Wasm
  environments:

  **Strategy A — Embed a complete JS runtime** (interpreter or JIT engine compiled to
  Wasm): Correct semantics because it IS a JS engine. Binary carries the full engine
  (~300KB–8MB overhead per module). GC is internal to the engine, independent of the
  host GC. JIT engines require runtime code generation — this is disabled in most
  serverless and edge Wasm hosts for security isolation (sandbox integrity requires
  no runtime code generation). When JIT is disabled, a JIT-capable engine falls back
  to its interpreter or baseline compiler, eliminating its primary performance advantage.

  This ceiling can be partially recovered through ahead-of-time pre-initialization
  and partial evaluation: a pre-initializer (e.g. Wizer) snapshots the engine after
  startup, eliminating initialization cost from the hot path; a partial evaluator
  (e.g. Weval) can specialize the interpreter against the known JS bytecode at build
  time, effectively doing offline JIT and producing specialized Wasm that approaches
  AOT performance. These techniques blur the boundary between "embed a runtime" and
  "AOT compile" — the compilation work is shifted from runtime to build time.

  The remaining costs are: the engine binary is still bundled (size overhead); the
  pre-initialization / partial-evaluation toolchain is an additional build-time
  dependency; and the resulting module is specialized to one program, losing the
  generic-engine property that made the approach attractive. At that point the
  approach converges toward AOT compilation, with a more complex pipeline.

  **Strategy B — Define a new Wasm-native language**: TypeScript syntax with Wasm-
  native semantics (no prototype chain, no dynamic `any`, no closures over mutable
  variables without explicit ref types). Maps directly to Wasm types. Excellent
  performance because the language is Wasm-shaped. Not a JS compiler — existing
  JavaScript and npm packages cannot be used; all code must be rewritten. Breaks the
  compatibility goal.

  **Strategy C — AOT compile JS with linear memory**: No embedded runtime, so no
  binary-size or startup overhead from a bundled engine. Full AOT performance potential.
  But JS heap objects must live somewhere — a custom GC in Wasm linear memory is
  required, operating independently of the host GC. Memory layout, allocation, and
  collection must all be implemented. Does not leverage the host's garbage collector
  or the emerging WasmGC type system.

  **Strategy D — AOT compile JS with WasmGC** (this project): No embedded runtime.
  JS objects are lowered to typed WasmGC structs; the host GC owns the heap. WasmGC
  struct types map naturally to JS object shapes. Aligned with the Component Model
  (WasmGC records ↔ component types). JIT is never relevant — the module is
  pre-compiled.

- Decision: Adopt Strategy D. AOT compilation with WasmGC as the type system.
  No embedded runtime; no custom GC; no new language.

- Consequences (positive): Binary contains only compiled program code — size scales
  with the JS source, not with a bundled engine. Cold start is proportional to Wasm
  instantiation, not engine initialization. In serverless/edge environments where JIT
  is disabled, an AOT-compiled module starts and runs at full speed from the first
  instruction, whereas an embedded JIT engine operating without JIT is an interpreter
  at interpreter speed. Host GC manages the heap — the compiler does not implement GC.
  Component Model integration is natural.

- Consequences (negative): The compiler must implement JS semantics directly in the
  output code — correctness burden is entirely on the compiler, not delegated to a
  battle-tested engine. WasmGC requires a capable host (wasmtime 44+, Chrome 119+).
  Workloads that a JS JIT engine would heavily optimize (hot polymorphic dispatch)
  are addressed through three complementary layers that do not require reimplementing
  speculative optimization in the compiler: (1) the compiler's own IR optimization
  pipeline (dead-code elimination, inlining, monomorphization, constant folding) which
  operates on typed IR before Wasm emission; (2) post-compilation Wasm optimization
  via wasm-opt (-O4), which applies Binaryen's full optimization suite to the Wasm
  output regardless of what the compiler emitted; and (3) the host Wasm runtime's JIT
  (where available), which optimizes hot Wasm paths at runtime independently of the
  JS compiler. Each layer is available unconditionally or as a flag; none requires
  changes to the compiler's analysis logic.

- Alternatives rejected: Strategy A rejected — JIT is disabled in target serverless/
  edge environments; pre-initialization and partial evaluation (Wizer/Weval) can
  recover performance at build time, but doing so converges toward AOT compilation
  with a more complex pipeline and a bundled engine binary that js2wasm avoids
  entirely. Strategy B rejected because JS compatibility is a hard requirement.
  Strategy C rejected in favour of Strategy D — WasmGC eliminates the custom-GC
  implementation cost and aligns better with the Component Model.

**ADR-003 — WasmGC over linear memory**

- Context: WasmGC gives the host GC responsibility for JS heap objects; linear memory
  requires a custom GC. WasmGC structs map naturally to JS objects (ADR-001 static path).
- Decision: Use WasmGC type system as the compilation target for JS values.
- Consequences: Requires WasmGC-capable host (wasmtime 44+, Chrome 119+, Firefox 120+).
  Eliminates GC implementation cost. Limits compatibility with hosts that lack WasmGC.

**ADR-003 — AOT compilation over JIT/interpreter**

- Context: JIT requires a JIT compiler inside the Wasm module (2MB+ overhead, speculative
  optimisation). Interpreter requires a bytecode VM (25–50× slower for hot code).
  AOT compiles TypeScript/JavaScript to static Wasm at build time.
- Decision: AOT only. No runtime code generation.
- Consequences: No eval() or dynamic `import()` support without a JS host import except
  for static strings known at compile time. Maximum performance for static code. Minimal
  binary size. See ADR-009 for eval.

**ADR-004 — Object layout via WasmGC struct types (closed-world)**

Sub-decision of ADR-001 (static specialization path).

- Context: JS objects are open — any key can be added at runtime. ADR-001 closed-world
  analysis determines object shapes statically within a compilation unit.
- Decision: Compile JS objects to typed WasmGC structs when the property set is
  statically known. Fall back to a map-backed `externref` object for open/dynamic cases.
  Assumption: static analysis of the code touching the object in the compilation unit
  can determine the shape ahead of time in most practical cases.
- Consequences: Fast property access (struct.get vs hash lookup). Class instantiation
  is allocation of a typed struct, not a map. Dynamic `obj[k]` falls back to the slow path.

**ADR-005 — Boundary guards at host-import surfaces**

Sub-decision of ADR-001 (boundary thunk strategy).

- Context: When a JS-compiled Wasm module calls out to the host (Node.js, WASI, browser),
  the host returns `externref` values. These values need type guards before entering the
  typed core. TypeScript annotations at the boundary seed the inference but are not trusted.
- Decision: Emit `ref.test` + `br_on_cast` guards at every host-import call site.
  Inside the Wasm module, values are always in their specific struct types.
- Consequences: Correct handling of heterogeneous host data. Negligible overhead
  (one Wasm instruction per boundary crossing).

**ADR-006 — Closure conversion via WasmGC ref-cell structs**

- Context: Mutable closure captures require heap allocation when the captured variable
  can be mutated after the closure is created. Immutable captures can be stack-allocated.
- Decision: Convert mutable captured variables to WasmGC structs (`struct (field $v (mut T))`).
  Immutable captures are inlined into the closure's struct fields.
- Consequences: Correct mutable-capture semantics. Slightly higher allocation rate for
  closures. No separate heap needed.

**ADR-007 — Dual string backend (wasm:js-string vs WasmGC i16 arrays)**

- Context: `wasm:js-string` builtins are fast (host-native string ops) but require a
  JS runtime. For WASI/standalone targets, no JS runtime is available.
- Decision: Two backends selectable at compile time. `--nativeStrings` / `--target wasi`
  forces the WasmGC i16-array backend. Default is `wasm:js-string` for JS-hosted targets.
  When shared across modules, the WasmGC i16-array backend implements the wasm:js-string
  APIs for interface compatibility.
- Consequences: All string operations must be implemented twice. Performance in
  native mode is acceptable for most workloads but slower than host-backed strings.

**ADR-008 — TypeScript annotations as inference seeds, not ground truth**

Sub-decision of ADR-001 (annotation handling).

- Context: TypeScript's type system is unsound (permits programs whose runtime behavior
  violates declared types) and erased (no runtime enforcement). Relying on TS annotations
  as ground truth for lowering decisions would produce incorrect code for programs that
  exploit unsoundness. At the same time, ignoring annotations entirely wastes information
  that narrows the inference search space.
- Decision: TypeScript annotations are treated as initial constraints (hypotheses) for
  the whole-program analysis described in ADR-001. They seed the inference and reduce
  convergence cost, but all lowering decisions require proof from the analysis, not just
  a matching annotation. A `number` annotation on a parameter is a constraint; if the
  call graph cannot prove all callers pass `f64`, the parameter stays `externref`.
- Consequences: Correct output for unsound TS programs. Higher inference precision
  than a fully annotation-free approach. Requires a two-pass design: seed from
  annotations, validate via analysis.

**ADR-009 — Dynamic eval() via host import**

- Context: `eval()` requires a compiler at runtime. AOT compilation (ADR-003) cannot
  compile `eval()` strings that are not statically known. Options: refuse eval, stub as
  no-op, implement an interpreter, or delegate to the host.
- Decision: `eval()` is either evaluated inline if the string is known at compile time,
  or compiled to a host import that compiles a dynamically generated Wasm module using
  host APIs (currently backed by a JS or Wasmtime host). This is consistent with
  ADR-001's dynamic escape hatch principle.
- Consequences: `eval()` works with full semantics on supported hosts. Not available
  standalone (WASI). No runtime compilation path inside the Wasm module itself.
- Alternatives: native JS host eval (unsafe — scope pollution), waiting for the JIT
  proposal (func.new by Ben Titzer), interpreter embedded in Wasm (violates ADR-003).

**ADR-011 — Implementation language: TypeScript, with the TypeScript compiler package as the frontend**

- Context: A compiler needs an implementation language and a frontend (parser + type
  resolver). The choices are independent but interact. For a JavaScript/TypeScript →
  Wasm compiler, the options for implementation language include Rust, Go, C++, Java,
  and TypeScript itself. The options for frontend include a custom parser, Babel, Acorn,
  SWC (Rust), tree-sitter, and the TypeScript compiler package (`typescript` npm).

- Decision: Implement the compiler in TypeScript, using the `typescript` npm package
  as the frontend for both parsing and type resolution.

  For the implementation language: TypeScript is the source language being compiled.
  Working in the same language reduces the semantic gap — the compiler author reasons
  about JS/TS semantics in the same language they are implementing, making it easier
  to validate that output Wasm preserves the correct behavior. Build-tool performance
  requirements are low (an AOT compiler runs once at build time, not in a hot loop);
  Rust or C++ would add implementation complexity without a runtime benefit. The
  TypeScript ecosystem provides vitest for testing, ts-node for development, and a
  large library of utilities.

  For the frontend: the `typescript` package provides a battle-tested parser that
  handles the full TypeScript and JavaScript grammar (TypeScript is a strict superset
  of JavaScript, so the same parser handles both). More importantly, it provides a
  type checker whose output is used in two ways:
  1. **For TypeScript files**: explicit type annotations (`: number`, `: string`,
     class shapes, return types) are extracted as initial constraints for the
     closed-world analysis (ADR-009). These seed the inference without being trusted
     as ground truth.
  2. **For plain JavaScript files and missing annotations**: the TypeScript checker
     performs its own inference on unannotated code — it can infer the type of a
     variable from its initializer, a function's return type from its body, and object
     shapes from assignment patterns. These inferred types are available through the
     same compiler API and are used to seed the analysis even when the source has no
     explicit annotations. This makes the frontend useful for pure JS input, not only
     TypeScript.

  Alternatives rejected: Babel and Acorn parse JavaScript but provide no type
  information — the analysis would have to start cold with no seeds. SWC provides
  types but through a Rust FFI boundary, adding cross-language complexity. A custom
  parser would be enormous scope with no benefit over a battle-tested implementation.
  Tree-sitter provides a parser but no type checker.

- Consequences (positive): Full TypeScript and JavaScript grammar handled correctly
  without a custom parser. Type information available for both annotated TypeScript
  and unannotated JavaScript, seeding the closed-world analysis in both cases.
  Implementation language matches the source language — semantic reasoning is direct.
  Fast iteration via TypeScript toolchain.

- Consequences (negative): The `typescript` package is large (~30MB) and its
  compilation API (using the full language service) is slower than a purpose-built
  parser. For a build tool this is acceptable. The compiler is coupled to TypeScript's
  AST shape; breaking changes in the TypeScript AST would require updates. The type
  checker's inference for plain JS is conservative — it does not infer types the
  compiler analysis would eventually prove, so seeds from JS files are fewer than
  from fully-annotated TypeScript.

**ADR-012 — Intermediate representation: multi-stage typed IR over lightweight codegen-oriented IR**

- Context: A compiler needs an IR to bridge the AST and Wasm emission. Two broad strategies
  exist. A lightweight, codegen-oriented IR couples analysis tightly to emission: type tags
  live on IR nodes and emission logic infers lowering decisions inline. This is fast to
  implement and sufficient for compilation strategies that accept fully boxed output for
  any value whose type cannot be trivially read from the source.

  The closed-world specialization strategy (ADR-001) requires more: shape inference to
  determine WasmGC struct layouts ahead of emission; type refinement to lower to unboxed
  primitives only where provably safe; whole-program analysis so that specialization in one
  function can depend on call-graph evidence from another; and explicit, auditable dynamic
  boundaries separating proven-static regions from boxed fallbacks. These requirements are
  difficult to satisfy when analysis and emission are interleaved in a single pass.

  A multi-stage IR separates concerns: a high-level semantic IR preserves full JS semantics;
  analysis passes annotate and refine it; a typed lowered IR makes lowering decisions
  explicit; and a final Wasm emission pass reads the lowered IR without re-deriving types.

- Decision: Adopt a multi-stage typed IR. The pipeline is:
  1. **High-level IR** — JS semantics intact: objects as open maps, closures as captures,
     control flow as structured nodes. This IR is independent of Wasm; it is the semantic
     domain for analysis.
  2. **Analysis passes** — whole-program type propagation (seeded from TypeScript
     annotations per ADR-009), shape inference (which properties are accessed, with what
     types), escape analysis (which objects can be stack-allocated or struct-lowered),
     and dynamic-boundary identification. Passes annotate IR nodes with refinement
     information without changing the semantic IR.
  3. **Lowered IR** — analysis decisions are committed: objects are replaced by typed
     WasmGC struct references or retained as boxed `externref`; values carry explicit
     boxed/unboxed tags; boundary guards appear as explicit IR instructions at the
     transitions. The lowered IR is Wasm-typed but not yet binary.
  4. **Wasm emission** — a read-only pass over the lowered IR that translates each node
     to the corresponding Wasm instruction sequence. No type inference at this stage.

  The IR is SSA-inspired but not strict SSA — value provenance is tracked for type
  refinement without the full renaming and phi-insertion cost of strict SSA construction.

- Consequences (positive): Clean separation between analysis and emission — each pass
  can be tested and evolved independently. Shape inference operates over the full
  program before any Wasm is emitted; WasmGC struct types are analytically determined,
  not guessed at emission time. Dynamic boundaries are explicit IR nodes, not ad-hoc
  conditional checks scattered through the codegen layer. Optimization passes (inlining,
  dead-code elimination, constant folding) operate on the typed lowered IR where
  specialization decisions are already committed, making their effect predictable.

- Consequences (negative): More infrastructure than a lightweight IR — each IR stage
  requires its own node types, traversal utilities, and test coverage. IR design must
  be stable across passes; premature changes to node shapes break all downstream passes.
  Higher initial implementation cost. This cost is amortized over the lifetime of the
  compiler: each new optimization pass benefits from the already-available typed IR
  without needing to re-derive type information.

- Alternatives rejected: Single-stage codegen-oriented IR — tightly couples type
  inference to emission, making whole-program analysis impractical. Type information
  must be re-derived at each emission site. Object shapes are not representable as
  first-class IR concepts; they must be inferred ad-hoc during struct-type allocation.
  Dynamic boundaries become implicit, auditable only by reading the codegen code rather
  than inspecting IR nodes. These constraints are acceptable for compilation strategies
  that always emit boxed output; they are incompatible with the specialization goals
  in ADR-001.

Link the `docs/adr/README.md` from `README.md` in the "Architecture" section.

## Acceptance criteria

1. All 12 ADR files exist at `docs/adr/0NNN-*.md` and are non-trivial (each ≥ 150 words).
2. Each ADR has Context / Decision / Consequences sections.
3. `docs/adr/README.md` index lists all 12 with status and one-line summary.
4. `README.md` links to `docs/adr/` under an "Architecture decisions" heading.
5. No ADR contradicts the current implementation (verify each against source before writing).
6. All ADRs are written for an audience of senior engine engineers, not end users.

## Out of scope

- ADRs for future decisions not yet made.
- Exhaustive design documents (ADRs are 200–400 words each, not 2,000).
- Benchmark data or performance measurements in ADRs (link to test262 dashboard instead).

## Risk

The main risk is writing ADRs that contradict the current implementation — stating
"we chose X" when the code actually does Y. Mitigate by reading the relevant source
files before writing each ADR.

## Notes

The ADR format is from Michael Nygard's 2011 article and is widely used in compiler
and systems projects (Rust RFC process, GHC proposals, V8 design docs). Engine engineers
recognise the format immediately. The compact 200–400 word limit is intentional — it
forces the author to state the decision clearly rather than hedging.
