# #1033 — Compile React to Wasm as a UI-library stress test

## Goal

Use [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) as a third real-world stress test for the js2wasm compiler, complementing #1031 (lodash = compute) and #1032 (axios = I/O). React exercises a distinct, interesting slice of ES semantics:

- **Hooks** — module-level state, closure capture of mutable refs, the "current owner" pattern
- **Reconciler** — deeply recursive tree diffing, linked lists, fibers
- **Symbols** — `Symbol.for('react.element')`, `Symbol.iterator`, tag constants
- **Frozen objects** — `Object.freeze` on ReactElements in dev mode
- **WeakMap / WeakRef** — ref forwarding, context value tracking
- **Synthetic events** — event system that wraps host events
- **setState / scheduler** — microtask batching, priority queueing
- **JSX** — already transpiled to `React.createElement` / `jsx()` calls by TypeScript, so we only see the compiled output

And most importantly: **React's core is host-agnostic.** `react` (the package) is pure compute over a virtual DOM. `react-dom` is the renderer that binds to actual DOM. This separation mirrors our own "compile it / import it" boundary:

- Compile **react** (the core)
- Treat **react-dom**'s DOM surface as host imports (same model as #1032's Node builtins)

## Why React specifically

- **Large and mature:** exposes corners of ES semantics that hand-written test262 doesn't hit (hooks are a unique language-level pattern)
- **Well-typed:** `@types/react` is authoritative; works natively with a TS-to-Wasm compiler
- **Clear layer split:** core ≠ renderer ≠ host. Lets us pick any layer as a separate compile target.
- **Benchmark value:** if React core runs in Wasm, we can benchmark hook call overhead, reconciler diffing, and render throughput against V8 React — a direct perf number for js2wasm.
- **Closure stress:** every hook is a closure over a ref cell. React's hook list implementation is the canonical torture test for closure capture + mutable state + identity stability.

## Core design — DOM as host imports

Same pattern as #1032 (Node builtins as host imports), but for DOM:

**Principle:** `react-dom` wants to manipulate DOM nodes. js2wasm should NOT compile the DOM — it should route `document`, `window`, `HTMLElement`, `Event`, etc. through externref host imports. In JS-host mode, the host provides real DOM objects; the Wasm instance holds externref handles.

**DOM surfaces to treat as host imports:**
- `document` global (createElement, createTextNode, getElementById, querySelector, etc.)
- `window` global (requestAnimationFrame, cancelAnimationFrame, addEventListener, setTimeout)
- `HTMLElement.prototype` methods (appendChild, removeChild, setAttribute, style, classList)
- `Event`, `CustomEvent`, `EventTarget` (dispatchEvent, preventDefault, stopPropagation)
- `Node` (nodeType, nodeName, textContent, parentNode)
- `Text`, `Comment`, `DocumentFragment`

The compiler should recognize these as "host-provided types" and emit all method calls through `__extern_method_call` / direct externref invocation, never trying to compile a DOM implementation.

## Approach

### Step 1 — Pick a tractable subset

**Tier 1 — react core primitives (no rendering):**
- `react/src/ReactElement.js` — element creation, Symbol.for('react.element')
- `react/src/ReactContext.js` — createContext
- `react/src/ReactRef.js` — forwardRef
- `react/src/ReactLazy.js`
- `react/src/ReactChildren.js` — Children.map, Children.only, Children.count

**Tier 2 — hooks module (the hard part):**
- `react/src/ReactHooks.js` — useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback, useRef, useContext, useReducer
- `react/src/ReactCurrentDispatcher.js` — module-level dispatcher slot
- `react/src/ReactCurrentOwner.js`

Hooks are the single most interesting thing to compile:
- `useState(x)` allocates a ref cell that persists across renders
- `useEffect(fn, deps)` queues side-effect closures that run after commit
- `useMemo` / `useCallback` cache function/value identity based on deps array equality
- The linked list of hooks per component is position-based — any bailout throws the whole list out of sync (this is the "rules of hooks" constraint)

A successful hooks compilation demonstrates that js2wasm can handle:
1. Module-level mutable state
2. Closures capturing mutable cell identities (not values)
3. Deps-array shallow comparison with `Object.is` semantics
4. Microtask scheduling (for effect flushing)

**Tier 3 — reconciler (react-reconciler):**
- `react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberReconciler.js`
- `react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js`
- `react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCompleteWork.js`
- Deeply recursive (or iterative with explicit stack), tree diffing, linked lists of fibers

This tier is the "can we compile production React" moment. If Tier 3 compiles, we have a virtual DOM reconciler running in Wasm.

**Tier 4 — react-dom renderer (with DOM as host imports):**
- `react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMComponent.js`
- `react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMHostConfig.js` — the host config is literally the adapter between react-reconciler and DOM
- `react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMEventListener.js`

This tier exercises the DOM-as-host-imports model. Every DOM method call goes through externref.

**Skip:**
- `react/src/ReactAct.js` — test utility, not production
- `react-devtools-*` — devtools integration
- Server components / Suspense / Concurrent features — bleeding edge, large additional surface
- `scheduler` package at first — has its own quirks; substitute a minimal synchronous scheduler during tier 2-3 compile

### Step 2 — Extend the compiler host-import set

Same mechanism as #1032 but for DOM:

```ts
// src/codegen/imports.ts
const DOM_HOST_GLOBALS = new Set([
  'document', 'window', 'navigator', 'location', 'history',
  'HTMLElement', 'Element', 'Node', 'Text', 'Comment',
  'Event', 'CustomEvent', 'EventTarget', 'MouseEvent', 'KeyboardEvent',
  'DocumentFragment', 'HTMLCollection', 'NodeList',
  'requestAnimationFrame', 'cancelAnimationFrame',
  'queueMicrotask',
]);
```

And for JS intrinsics React depends on heavily:
- `Symbol.for` / `Symbol.iterator` — needs solid Symbol support (verify via test262 Symbol tests)
- `Object.is` — for deps comparison
- `Object.freeze` — for dev-mode ReactElement immutability (may need to compile to a no-op in production)
- `WeakMap`, `WeakRef` — context + ref tracking

Gap-fix any of these that aren't yet solid in js2wasm.

### Step 3 — Build a harness

Create `scripts/react-stress.ts`:

```ts
import { compile } from '../src/index.ts';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

const tiers = {
  t1: [
    'react/cjs/react.development.js',
    // or split: 'react/src/ReactElement.js', etc.
  ],
  t2: [
    // hooks module entry points
  ],
  t3: [
    'react-reconciler/cjs/react-reconciler.development.js',
  ],
  t4: [
    'react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js',
  ],
};

for (const [tier, modules] of Object.entries(tiers)) {
  console.log(`=== ${tier} ===`);
  for (const mod of modules) {
    const src = readFileSync(`node_modules/${mod}`, 'utf-8');
    const result = await compile(src, {
      fileName: mod,
      domAsHostImports: true,
    });
    console.log(result.success ? `  OK   ${mod}` : `  FAIL ${mod}: ${result.errors[0]?.message?.slice(0, 80)}`);
  }
}
```

React ships both development (unminified, dev-only checks) and production builds. Prefer the `cjs/*.development.js` variant for compilation — it's readable and the dev-only branches are easy to spot.

### Step 4 — Smoke test: render a component

Once Tier 4 compiles, the ultimate acceptance test:

```ts
const React = await loadCompiledReact();
const ReactDOM = await loadCompiledReactDOM();

function Counter() {
  const [n, setN] = React.useState(0);
  React.useEffect(() => { console.log('mounted'); }, []);
  return React.createElement('button', { onClick: () => setN(n + 1) }, `Count: ${n}`);
}

// In a test harness that provides a real document (jsdom or Playwright):
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(React.createElement(Counter));
assert(document.querySelector('button').textContent === 'Count: 0');
document.querySelector('button').click();
// Wait for effect flush
assert(document.querySelector('button').textContent === 'Count: 1');
```

This proves:
1. Compiled React core runs
2. Hooks work (useState + useEffect)
3. DOM host imports round-trip correctly
4. Event handlers survive the Wasm boundary (callback as externref)
5. Reconciler commit + effect flush ordering is correct

### Step 5 — Categorize failures and file follow-ups

Same process as #1031 / #1032. Expected React-specific buckets:

- **Symbol.for('react.element') path** — need stable Symbol identity across modules
- **Object.freeze no-op in production but real in dev** — branch on env
- **Hook dispatcher slot swapping** — module-level variable re-assignment across function calls
- **Linked list fiber structs** — expect type-inference gaps on recursive `next: Fiber | null`
- **Closure capture of mutable ref cell** — this is the #1 test of our closure model
- **`useEffect` deps comparison with `Object.is`** — needs correct NaN/zero semantics
- **Microtask scheduling** — queueMicrotask as a host import
- **Try/catch around render** — React catches errors and routes to error boundaries
- **Private class fields in dev-only warnings** — may hit compiler gaps
- **`process.env.NODE_ENV` dead-code elimination** — if we don't DCE, dev-only paths compile too

### Step 6 — Document in sprint doc

Append to `plan/issues/sprints/41/sprint.md`:

```markdown
## react stress results

Tier 1 (core primitives): X/N compile
Tier 2 (hooks):           X/N compile
Tier 3 (reconciler):      X/N compile
Tier 4 (react-dom):       X/N compile

Smoke test (Counter component): <PASS|FAIL>

Top error buckets:
  <count> <pattern> → #<followup-issue>

DOM host imports inventory: <list>
JS intrinsic gaps: <list>
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `scripts/react-stress.ts` exists and runs against a local react install
- [ ] `DOM_HOST_GLOBALS` set defined in the compiler (`document`, `window`, DOM classes, `requestAnimationFrame`, `queueMicrotask`, etc.)
- [ ] Tier 1 (core primitives) compiles cleanly (≥ 5 modules)
- [ ] Tier 2 (hooks) attempted — even a partial compile produces valuable error data
- [ ] Error bucket report committed/linked
- [ ] ≥ 4 follow-up issues filed (React stresses more dimensions; expect more patterns than lodash/axios)
- [ ] Sprint 41 doc updated
- [ ] **Stretch goal:** the Counter smoke test passes end-to-end from compiled React in Wasm

## Non-goals

- Full React compatibility — out of scope
- Concurrent React / Suspense — too much surface for one sprint
- React Native renderer — different host
- Server components — different execution model
- Competing with V8 React on perf — correctness first, benchmarks after

## Design notes

**Why start with the dev build?**

`react.development.js` has human-readable code, named functions, and explicit dev-only branches (`if (__DEV__)`). It's easier to diagnose compile errors against it. Production can come later once dev compiles cleanly.

**Hooks are the single hardest feature to compile right.**

Hooks rely on:
1. **Call ordering stability** — hook N in render 1 must be hook N in render 2
2. **Closure capture of a mutable ref** — `useState` returns `[value, setValue]` where `setValue` captures the ref cell, not the value
3. **Module-level dispatcher state** — `ReactCurrentDispatcher.current` gets swapped out per render
4. **Work-in-progress vs current state** — each fiber has two hook lists

Our closure model handles (2) and (3) if and only if ref cells are first-class WasmGC structs, not per-call copies. If hooks compile but don't work, the bug is almost certainly "closure captured the value, not the cell." This is a high-value debugging target; most TS-to-Wasm compilers fail this test.

**JSX is NOT a problem.**

JSX is transpiled by TypeScript before js2wasm sees it. We see `React.createElement(...)` or (with new JSX transform) `jsx(...)` calls. That's just function invocation — handled by existing codegen. No parser work needed.

**Object.freeze in production is a no-op.**

React freezes elements in dev mode for safety. In production it's stripped. If we hit an `Object.freeze` codegen gap, the fix might be as simple as "ignore `Object.freeze` when the target is production mode" — which is what minifiers do. Verify the prod build elides it before shipping fixes.

**Scheduler.**

React's `scheduler` package implements a priority queue with `MessageChannel` (browser) or `setImmediate` (Node) for microtask scheduling. For the first compile pass, substitute a trivial synchronous scheduler that just runs tasks inline. It's not correct for concurrent React but is correct enough for the Counter smoke test.

## Related

- Sibling of: **#1031** (lodash — compute), **#1032** (axios — I/O)
- Feeds into: future "compile any npm package" story
- Unblocks: UI rendering benchmarks against V8 React, a real-world hook performance number
- Depends on solid: Symbol, Object.freeze, WeakMap, closures, queueMicrotask

## Trilogy summary

Three complementary real-world stress tests mapping to distinct compiler challenges:

| Library | Domain | Stresses |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **lodash** (#1031) | Pure compute | Iteration, prototype chain, generic TS types, recursion, array semantics |
| **axios** (#1032) | I/O | Node builtins as host imports, streams, EventEmitter, Promise chains, Buffer |
| **react** (#1033) | UI library | Hooks (closure + ref cell), Symbol.for, Object.freeze, DOM as host imports, reconciler recursion |

Each harvests a different slice of real-world JS patterns that our test262 baseline doesn't hit. Running all three gives us the broadest compiler-correctness signal we can get without building a real application ourselves.

## Architect Assessment (arch-npm-stress, 2026-04-11)

**Baseline commit:** 07ac0224

### Required compiler features

- `Symbol.for('react.element')` with stable identity across modules
- Module-level mutable state (`ReactCurrentDispatcher.current` slot-swap per render)
- Closures that capture a **mutable ref cell**, not the current scalar value (useState/useReducer identity)
- Deps-array shallow comparison with `Object.is` semantics (NaN, `-0`)
- `WeakMap` for ref tracking / context values (object-identity keys)
- `Object.freeze` on ReactElement (no-op in prod is fine)
- Recursive fiber types with `next: Fiber | null`
- DOM host imports (`document`, `window`, `HTMLElement`, `Event`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `queueMicrotask`)
- `try`/`catch` around render for error boundaries
- `Map` keyed by function identity for reconciler work loops
- `process.env.NODE_ENV` DCE to strip dev-only branches

### Leverage TypeScript type information

React ships as plain `.js` with no bundled types. Install **`@types/react`** as a dev dep — gives precise signatures for `useState<T>`, `useEffect`, `createElement`, `FunctionComponent`, `Dispatch<SetStateAction<T>>`, etc. Together with **`@types/react-dom`** for Tier 4. Pair with the DOM host-globals typing from `lib.dom.d.ts` (already loaded by TypeScript via default libs) — this is where `Document`, `HTMLElement`, `Event`, `queueMicrotask`, etc. are typed. **#1045** should register DOM extern classes against those declaration types, not reinvent signatures.

### Correction (2026-04-11): module graph already exists

Earlier wording implied that cross-file React source references require a pre-bundle step. That is wrong. `compileProject` (`src/index.ts:216`) walks React's transitive import closure via `ModuleResolver` (`src/resolve.ts:27`) and `resolveAllImports` (`src/resolve.ts:204`), then hands all files to `compileMultiSource` (`src/compiler.ts:406`) for one shared `ts.Program`. The single-file `preprocessImports` fallback is not on this path. The DOM gap below is about **ambient globals**, not about module resolution.

### Current compiler gaps

- **`DOM_HOST_GLOBALS` not defined.** `document`, `window`, `HTMLElement`, `Event`, `Node`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `queueMicrotask`, etc. are not registered as extern classes. Every `document.createElement(...)` call references an unresolved ambient global that the shape inferencer cannot type. Needs an extern-class-registration hook analogous to the Map/Set registration at `src/codegen/index.ts:2661,:4100`, plus a `DOM_GLOBAL_INTRINSICS` set. Filed as **#1045**.
- **`queueMicrotask` has no compile-time mapping.** Required for effect flushing. Small, rolled into the DOM-host-globals scaffold.
- **`process.env.NODE_ENV` not DCE'd** — tracked as **#1043**. Without it, `react.development.js` compiles ~40% more code than necessary, amplifying bug surface.
- **Recursive fiber types widen to externref** — correctness OK (src/shape-inference.ts widens unresolvable recursive unions), but field reads go through runtime dispatch, not struct accessors. Perf is bad but not a blocker.
- **`async`/`await` is a no-op** at src/codegen/expressions.ts:973 (verified 2026-05-21 — was L790). Concurrent React / Suspense cannot work. Acceptable to defer — the Counter smoke test does not require `await`.
- **`Object.is`** — verify NaN and `-0` semantics match ES spec across Wasm float paths; unclear whether a dedicated intrinsic is registered.

### Hooks feasibility assessment — **YES, hooks should compile correctly**

This is the most important single verdict in this issue.

The mutable-ref-cell closure path at `src/codegen/closures.ts:971-1131` (`getOrRegisterRefCellType` and the capture-boxing loop) is **exactly** the primitive `useState` needs:

1. `const [n, setN] = useState(0)` — the runtime allocates a ref cell struct `struct (field $value (mut externref))` and returns the cell alongside a closure that captures it by reference.
2. `setN(x)` — the closure writes into `$value` via `struct.set`. It captures the **cell**, not the scalar — so the write is visible to the next `useState` read during the next render.
3. Module-level `let ReactCurrentDispatcher = { current: null }` compiles to a Wasm global, which means `ReactCurrentDispatcher.current = dispatcher` in `beginWork` is visible to hook calls during that render pass. This is the module-level slot-swap pattern — already supported.

**The only open question** is cross-render hook-list stability — React's "rules of hooks" require `useState` calls to execute in a stable index order each render. That is React's responsibility, not the compiler's; we just need call-ordering determinism, which we have.

**Therefore:** once DOM host globals are wired and #1043 (NODE_ENV DCE) lands, Tier 2 (hooks module) is achievable. The Counter smoke test (`useState` + `useEffect` + click) is realistic as the first end-to-end test.

### Projected readiness (JS-host mode, via `compileProject`, production build preferred)

| Tier | Modules | Readiness |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 — core primitives (`ReactElement`, `createContext`, `forwardRef`, `ReactChildren`) | ~6 | **~60%** — Symbol.for path works via runtime.ts:1618 |
| Tier 2 — hooks (`ReactHooks`, `ReactCurrentDispatcher`) | ~4 | **~50%** — ref-cell closure model enables this |
| Tier 3 — reconciler (`ReactFiberReconciler`, `ReactFiberBeginWork`) | ~6 | **~25%** — compiles but perf walls from widened recursive types |
| Tier 4 — react-dom | ~5 | **~0%** until DOM host-import scaffold lands |

### Top 3 blockers

1. **`DOM_HOST_GLOBALS` compile-time routing + `queueMicrotask` intrinsic** — the core feature this issue proposes. Medium effort (~1 sprint). Parallel to #1032's Node-builtin routing; design them together.
2. **#1043 `process.env.NODE_ENV` DCE** — easy fix, high leverage. Halves React's compiled surface area. Pre-requisite for efficient iteration on Tier 2+.
3. **Recursive type widening perf** — fiber nodes widen to externref through `src/shape-inference.ts`, making hot reads go through runtime dispatch instead of struct accessors. Correctness OK; perf blocker for Tier 3 reconciler.

### Implementation sketch for DOM host globals

Same mechanism as the Node-builtin set proposed in #1032, but keyed on **global identifier** rather than module specifier:

```ts
// src/codegen/index.ts — alongside the Map/Set/WeakMap extern class registration at :2661 and :4100
const DOM_EXTERN_CLASSES = [
  ['Document', { methods: ['createElement', 'createTextNode', 'getElementById', 'querySelector', ...] }],
  ['Element',  { methods: ['appendChild', 'removeChild', 'setAttribute', 'addEventListener', ...] }],
  ['Event',    { methods: ['preventDefault', 'stopPropagation'] }],
  // ...
];

const DOM_GLOBAL_INTRINSICS = new Set([
  'document', 'window', 'navigator', 'location',
  'requestAnimationFrame', 'cancelAnimationFrame', 'queueMicrotask',
]);
```

Each global resolves to an externref import at compile time; method calls dispatch via the existing `__extern_method_call` path.

**Recommendation:** attempt Tier 1 + Tier 2 (hooks) first. Ship the Counter smoke test as the acceptance milestone. Tier 3 (reconciler) and Tier 4 (react-dom) are realistic follow-ups but each is ~1 sprint of its own.
