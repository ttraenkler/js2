# #789 -- TypeError null/undefined guard over-triggering (15,630 tests)

## Problem

The null guard system (implemented in #775, #780, #781) inserts `ref.test` + TypeError throw before property accesses to prevent null pointer traps. However, the guards are over-triggering: they throw TypeError on **valid** property accesses where the reference is non-null but the `ref.test` against the expected struct type fails.

This is the **single largest failure category** at 15,630 tests -- over half of all runtime failures.

### Root cause

The null guard emits code like:
```wasm
local.get $obj
ref.test $ExpectedStruct
i32.eqz
if  ;; throw TypeError
```

But when `$obj` is a valid object of a *different* struct type (e.g., a subclass or a different struct that has the same field), `ref.test` returns 0 (not the expected type) even though the object is perfectly valid. The guard incorrectly interprets this as a null/undefined access.

## Fix approach

1. **Multi-struct dispatch in guard**: Instead of `ref.test $OneStruct`, check against all struct types that have the accessed field (similar to `findAlternateStructsForField`)
2. **Only guard against actual null**: Replace `ref.test $Struct ; i32.eqz` with `ref.is_null` -- only throw TypeError when the reference is actually null, not when it's a different struct type
3. **Hybrid approach**: Use `ref.is_null` for the TypeError guard, then use multi-struct dispatch (with `ref.test` per candidate) for the actual property access

## Key code locations

- `src/codegen/property-access.ts:135` — `emitNullGuardedStructGet()` — the main guard function (already uses ref.is_null + backup-based multi-struct dispatch)
- `src/codegen/property-access.ts:163` — `findAlternateStructsForField()` — finds other structs with same field name
- `src/codegen/statements.ts:808` — `emitNullGuard()` — used in destructuring, for-of
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts:10827` — null check before guarded cast
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts:2276,2596,2942` — TypeError in destructuring contexts

Note: `emitNullGuardedStructGet` already has multi-struct dispatch and ref.is_null checks. The remaining 15,630 failures likely come from:
1. Guards in OTHER locations that still use `ref.test $Struct ; i32.eqz` pattern
2. `emitNullGuard` in statements.ts using a different (simpler) guard pattern
3. Cases where the backup local isn't set up (no `__lastGuardedCastBackup`)
4. Externref values that aren't Wasm structs at all (pure JS objects from host)

## Files to modify

- `src/codegen/property-access.ts` — main null guard dispatch
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — null guard emission in `compilePropertyAccess`, `compileElementAccess`, `compileCallExpression`
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — `emitNullGuard` + null guard in `compileForOfStatement`

## Acceptance criteria

- TypeError null/undefined guard only fires for actually-null references
- 15,630 test failures reduced by at least 80%
- No new null pointer traps introduced
