# Issue #556: O(n^2) struct deduplication in ensureStructForType

## Problem

`ensureStructForType` in `src/codegen/index.ts` performed a linear scan over all entries in `ctx.structFields` to find a structurally matching anonymous struct. For codebases with many anonymous object types, this O(n) scan per call results in O(n^2) overall behavior.

## Solution

Replaced the linear scan with a hash-based O(1) lookup using a new `anonStructHash: Map<string, string>` field on `CodegenContext`. A helper function `fieldsHashKey` computes a deterministic string key from the field names, type kinds, and typeIdx values (for ref/ref_null types).

## Implementation Summary

**What was done:**
- Added `fieldsHashKey(fields: FieldDef[]): string` helper that builds a canonical key from field signatures
- Added `anonStructHash: Map<string, string>` to `CodegenContext` (hash key -> struct name)
- Replaced the O(n) loop in `ensureStructForType` with a single `Map.get()` call
- When registering a new anonymous struct, also populates `anonStructHash`

**Files changed:**
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — interface, both initialization sites, and `ensureStructForType` function

**Tests passing:** All existing tests pass with no regressions (anon-struct, closures, class, arrays-enums, etc.)
