# #1037 — Symbol.dispose / Symbol.asyncDispose not accessible (30 FAIL)

## Problem

30 tests fail with `Symbol(Symbol.dispose) is not a function` or related errors. These tests try to
use `Symbol.dispose` and `Symbol.asyncDispose` (TC39 Explicit Resource Management proposal) as
well-known symbols to define disposable resources.

The error `Symbol(Symbol.dispose) is not a function` means the value retrieved from `Symbol.dispose`
is the Symbol itself (not a callable), or the property lookup doesn't resolve to a function.

### Sample failing tests

**1. built-ins/DisposableStack/prototype/use/returns-value.js**
Error: `Symbol(Symbol.dispose) is not a function`
```js
var value = {
  [Symbol.dispose]() {}
};
var stack = new DisposableStack();
stack.use(value);
```

**2. language/statements/using/syntax/using-invalid-assignment-next-expression-for.js**
Error: `returned 2 — assert #1 at L12`
```js
assert.throws(TypeError, function() {
  for (using i = null; i === null; i = { [Symbol.dispose]() {} }) {}
});
```

**3. language/statements/await-using/throws-error-as-is-if-only-one-error-during-disposal.js**
Error: `returned 2 — ...await using _1 = { async [Symbol.asyncDispose]() { ... } }`
Tests the `await using` declaration with `Symbol.asyncDispose`.

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§7.4.12 GetDisposeMethod](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-getdisposemethod) — looks up @@dispose or @@asyncDispose on the resource
- [§20.4.2.3 Symbol.dispose](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-symbol.dispose) — well-known symbol for synchronous disposal
- [§20.4.2.1 Symbol.asyncDispose](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-symbol.asyncdispose) — well-known symbol for asynchronous disposal


## Root cause in compiler

`Symbol.dispose` and `Symbol.asyncDispose` are well-known symbols (like `Symbol.iterator`,
`Symbol.toPrimitive`, etc.). The test262 runtime provides these as globals, but:
1. The compiler may not know about `Symbol.dispose`/`Symbol.asyncDispose` when resolving computed property keys `[Symbol.dispose]`
2. The runtime.ts may not pass these symbols through to the extern host environment correctly
3. The `using` declaration itself (`for (using x = ...)`) may not be compiled at all

Check `src/codegen/expressions.ts` or property-access compilation for `Symbol.dispose`.

Note: `Symbol.dispose` was added in Node.js 22+ and is available in Node.js v25.9.0.

## Suggested fix

1. Add `Symbol.dispose` and `Symbol.asyncDispose` to the list of known well-known symbols in the compiler's Symbol handling (similar to `Symbol.iterator`, `Symbol.toPrimitive`).
2. Ensure the runtime passes these symbols correctly when building imports.
3. For `using` declarations: check if the `using` statement AST node is handled in `statements.ts`. If not, add basic compilation support.

## Acceptance criteria

- `built-ins/DisposableStack/prototype/use/returns-value.js` passes
- `built-ins/Symbol/asyncDispose/prop-desc.js` passes
- At least 15 of the 30 failing tests start passing

## Implementation

Registered `dispose` (id 13) and `asyncDispose` (id 14) as well-known symbols.

- `src/codegen/literals.ts` — added to `WELL_KNOWN_SYMBOLS`
- `src/codegen/property-access.ts` — added to the local copy of the symbol table
- `src/runtime.ts`:
  - Added `_disposeSym` / `_asyncDisposeSym` with `(Symbol as any).dispose ?? Symbol.for("Symbol.dispose")` fallback for older runtimes
  - Added both to `_symbolToWasm`, `_symbolIdToKeys`, and the `__box_symbol` cache
  - Extended the well-known symbol ID range in `_safeGet`/`_safeSet` from `1..12` to `1..14`
- `src/compiler/output.ts` — extended the standalone `__box_symbol` factory string literal to include IDs 13/14

## Test Results

`tests/issue-1037.test.ts` — 3/3 pass (Symbol.dispose identity, Symbol.asyncDispose identity, distinct from each other).

Scoped test262 probe of 25 tests under `built-ins/Symbol/{dispose,asyncDispose}` and `built-ins/DisposableStack/prototype/use`:
- 12/25 PASS (all 6 `Symbol/{dispose,asyncDispose}/*.js` tests plus 6 DisposableStack.use tests)
- 13 TRAP — remaining failures are DisposableStack-internal runtime issues (graceful null-extern path, not symbol resolution) and need further work tracked under #830/#1036 parent issues.

The `using` / `await using` declaration syntax is not yet supported in codegen and was left out of scope — it needs separate AST handling in `statements.ts` per the original suggested-fix list.
