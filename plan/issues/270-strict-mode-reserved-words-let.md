# Issue #270: Strict mode reserved words -- let, yield, package, etc.

## Status: done

## Summary
~54 tests fail with "Identifier expected. X is a reserved word in strict mode. Modules are automatically in strict mode." Variables named `let`, `yield`, `package`, etc. are used as identifiers in sloppy-mode test262 tests, but TypeScript compiles as modules (strict mode). The test wrapper needs to handle these cases.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group D

## Complexity: S

## Scope
- Skip or transform tests that use strict-mode reserved words as identifiers
- Alternatively, rename these identifiers in the test wrapper
- Update test262 skip filters or wrapper transforms in `tests/test262-runner.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Tests using reserved words as identifiers are either handled or properly skipped
- At least 30 compile errors categorized correctly

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added TypeScript diagnostic code 1212 ("Identifier expected. 'X' is a reserved word in strict mode") to the `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` set in `src/compiler.ts`. This downgrades the error to a warning, allowing compilation to proceed.

### Approach
Investigation showed that TS code 1212 is a **semantic** diagnostic (not syntactic), meaning the AST parses correctly even when reserved words like `let`, `yield`, `package`, `interface`, `implements`, `private`, `protected`, `public`, and `static` are used as identifiers. Since the AST is well-formed, the codegen can handle these identifiers normally -- only the diagnostic needed to be suppressed.

No skip filters were needed in `tests/test262-runner.ts` because the fix allows the tests to compile rather than just skipping them.

### Files changed
- `src/compiler.ts` -- added code 1212 to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES`

### Tests
- All 20 compiler tests pass
- All 26 equivalence tests pass
