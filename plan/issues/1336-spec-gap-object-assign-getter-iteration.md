# #1336 — Object.assign: getter invocation + Symbol-key copying

## Problem

`built-ins/Object/assign`: **11 / 38 pass (28.9%) — 27 fails (21 assertion_fail, 6 runtime_error)**.

Spec §20.1.2.1 (Object.assign) requires CopyDataProperties to:
1. Enumerate **own enumerable** keys (string + Symbol) of each source.
2. **Invoke getters** on the source — the call must observe the receiver as the source object.
3. **Set** (not DefineOwnProperty) on the target — so target setters and prototype setters are invoked.
4. Skip non-enumerable own keys.
5. Throw if any individual Get/Set throws (and stop the iteration).

The current implementation in `src/codegen/object-ops.ts` (look for `compileObjectAssign`) and the
host fallback `__object_assign` does:
- Iterates only **string** keys (not Symbol keys).
- Reads via direct field access — getters are not invoked on typed structs.
- Writes via direct field assignment — target setters not invoked.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `built-ins/Object/assign/source-own-prop-error.js` passes (getter throw aborts iteration).
2. `built-ins/Object/assign/target-set-symbol.js` passes (Symbol keys copied).
3. `built-ins/Object/assign/Symbol-keys.js` passes.
4. Pass-rate for `built-ins/Object/assign` rises from 29% to ≥75%.

## Files to modify

- `src/codegen/object-ops.ts` — Object.assign emitter
- `src/codegen/property-access.ts` — common get/set with getter/setter invocation
- `src/runtime.ts` — `__object_assign` host fallback (mostly correct already; verify Symbol key handling)

## Implementation Plan

### Root cause

`compileObjectAssign` does a fast loop using `array.copy` on the underlying struct field-list and
skips the per-key Get/Set protocol entirely. This is fine for plain typed structs but wrong when:
- Source has accessor properties.
- Source is a Proxy (must trap).
- Either has Symbol keys.

### Approach

Two-phase:

1. **Fast path** — both source and target are plain typed structs with no accessors and no Symbol
   keys: keep the current `array.copy`-style emit.
2. **Slow path** — fall through to a generic loop:
   ```
   for key in OwnPropertyKeys(source):
     if !desc.enumerable: continue
     v = Get(source, key)   ;; honors accessors
     Set(target, key, v)    ;; honors target setters
   ```
   This must call into the runtime helper since the keys aren't known at compile time.

The key check at the call site: if either source or target is `externref` (or any object whose
type carries an accessor), pick the slow path.

### Edge cases

- Source is null/undefined → ignore (per spec).
- Source has a getter that mutates the source mid-iteration → spec says re-evaluate keys
  is unspecified; we should enumerate once at start.
- Target is frozen → Set throws TypeError at first non-existent property.

### Test262 sample

- `test262/test/built-ins/Object/assign/source-own-prop-error.js`
- `test262/test/built-ins/Object/assign/target-set-symbol.js`
- `test262/test/built-ins/Object/assign/source-own-prop-keys-error.js`

## Implementation Notes (2026-05-08)

### Scope of this PR — runtime-only host-bridge fixes

Two surface fixes in `_wrapForHost`'s Proxy:

1. **Accessor invocation in `safeGetField`** — when a property is reached
   during host-side `Object.assign`, the Proxy's `get` trap now invokes the
   stored accessor getter (string key: sidecar `__get_<k>`; symbol key:
   `_wasmStructAccessors` map). For Wasm-closure getters the call routes
   through the `__call_fn_0` export so the closure runs inside Wasm, matching
   the existing pattern at line 1094.
2. **Symbol-keyed accessor enumeration in `collectKeys`** — Symbol keys
   defined via `Object.defineProperty(obj, sym, {get/set})` live in
   `_wasmStructAccessors`, not `_wasmStructProps`. The `ownKeys` trap now
   enumerates both maps, and the string-key path strips `__get_<k>` /
   `__set_<k>` accessor sidecar entries (returning the underlying property
   name) so `Object.assign` and spread copy the correct keys.

### Out of scope

The architect's spec calls for a "slow path" in `compileObjectAssign` that
loops with Get/Set per key. That requires:
- Routing `Object.defineProperty(obj, key, {get(){...}})` programmatic calls
  through the same `__defineProperty_accessor` import that object-literal
  accessor declarations use today (currently only literal-form `{get x(){…}}`
  hits `__defineProperty_accessor`; the programmatic form goes via the host
  fallback, which silently misses the getter for opaque WasmGC targets).
- A `compileObjectAssign` codegen-level fast/slow path split with shape
  analysis to gate on accessor-presence.

Both are larger refactors filed against this issue as follow-up work. The
runtime-level proxy fixes here unblock the symbol-key bucket of test262
fails without those compiler changes.

## Test Results

- `tests/issue-1336.test.ts` — 2/2 pass (Symbol-keyed accessor copy + plain
  data property no-regression).
- `tests/equivalence/{object-define-property,object-mutability,sparse-array-spread}.test.ts`
  — 32/32 pass, no regressions.

## Frontmatter reconcile (2026-06-12)

Was `in-progress` with no open PR, no active agent, and no Suspended Work section (session died sprints 42-52). Reset to `ready` during the sprint-62 issue review; re-validate against current main before claiming (#2148).

## Verify-first re-scope + fix (2026-06-28, sendev-soundness)

**Re-probed against current `origin/main` (de24f6c). The issue's 2026-05-08
framing is partly stale: getter invocation now WORKS.** Probe results before the
fix:

| case | before | note |
|------|--------|------|
| `Object.assign(t, {get a(){return 42}})` → `t.a` | **42 ✓** | getters already invoked (prior `_wrapForHost` work) |
| getter throw aborts iteration | **✓** | already correct |
| `Object.defineProperty(o, sym, {value})` → `o[sym]` | **✓** | defineProperty-form symbol keys already work |
| `const s = {[k]: 7}` (k=Symbol) → `s[k]` | **NaN ✗** | the real remaining gap |
| `{[k]:7}` → `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(s).length` | **0 ✗** | key not a real Symbol |
| `{[k]:7}` → `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(s).length` | **1 ✗** | landed under STRING key |
| `Object.assign`/spread of `{[k]:7}` | **NaN ✗** | source never had the symbol |

### Root cause (precise)

The gap is **upstream of Object.assign** — a computed **Symbol-keyed object
LITERAL** drops symbol identity. A user `Symbol()` lowers to a bare **i32**
counter id (`compileSymbolCall`, literals.ts). The #2126 runtime-computed-key
WRITE path (`literals.ts` ~:573 data, ~:655 method) compiled the key with
`compileExpression(ctx, fctx, prop.name.expression)` — **no expected-type
hint** — then a manual `coerceType(i32 → externref)`, which boxes the id as a
**NUMBER** (`__box_number`). So `{ [k]: 7 }` did `__extern_set(obj, 100, 7)` →
the property landed under string key `"100"`. The element-READ path
(`property-access.ts` → `compileExpression(..., {kind:"externref"})`) DOES box an
`ESSymbolLike` i32 via `__box_symbol` (expressions.ts:753-762), so write/read
disagreed → `o[k]` missed it; `getOwnPropertySymbols` saw nothing; `Object.assign`
and spread (which CopyDataProperties off the real own-symbol set) had nothing to
copy. Element-WRITE `o[k] = v` already passed the hint and was correct.

### Fix (surgical, ~1 line × 2 sites)

`src/codegen/literals.ts` — pass the `{ kind: "externref" }` expected-type hint to
`compileExpression` at both #2126 computed-key sites (data property + method), so
an ESSymbol key boxes via `__box_symbol` (a real JS Symbol), matching the
read/write paths. Non-symbol runtime keys (number/string) are unaffected — the
hint boxes those exactly as the prior `coerceType` did.

After the fix all probe cases pass: `s[k]`=7, `getOwnPropertySymbols`=1,
`getOwnPropertyNames`=0, `Object.assign`/spread copy the symbol, mixed
string+symbol literals keep both, and controls (getter invoke, plain copy,
numeric computed key) are unchanged.

### Tests / checks
- `tests/issue-1336.test.ts` — extended to 8 cases (2 prior + 6 new
  symbol-literal cases incl. assign/spread/mixed + numeric-key control). All pass.
- Regression sweep (suites importing the compiler directly): `computed-props`,
  `issue-computed-props`, `object-literals`, `iterators`,
  `issue-2029-disposablestack-static-read-standalone`, `issue-2151-spread-literal`
  — all green. (`object-literal-getters-setters` / `computed-property-class`
  error on a pre-existing `./helpers.js` module-resolution quirk in this shallow
  worktree — reproduced with the fix stashed; unrelated to this change.)
- `prettier`, `biome lint`, `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- test262 `built-ins/Object/assign` delta confirmed by CI (the symbol-key bucket;
  getters were already passing). Real test262 conformance is the CI gate.
