# #660 — Capture first failing assert in test output for returned-0 tests

## Status: in-review
12,974 tests fail with "returned 0" but no information about WHICH assertion failed. The wrapTest function wraps the body in try/catch and sets __fail=1, but doesn't record the failing assert.

### Implementation

Added `__assert_count` counter (starting at 1) to the wrapTest preamble. Each assert shim increments the counter before checking, and on first failure stores the counter value in `__fail` (only if `__fail` is still 0, preserving the first failure). The test function now returns `__fail` instead of 0.

Return value semantics:
- `1` = pass (all asserts succeeded)
- `-1` = uncaught exception (not from an assert shim)
- `>= 2` = the (ret-1)th assert call (1-based) that failed

The runner maps the return value back to the original source by scanning for the Nth `assert` call and extracting the line text (up to 160 chars).

Updated shims:
- `assert_sameValue`, `assert_notSameValue`, `assert_true`
- `assert_throws`, `assert_sameValue_str`
- `assert_sameValue_bool`, `assert_notSameValue_bool`
- `assert_compareArray`
- `$DONE` (both instances)
- Inline typeof assertions (regex-expanded in body)
- Catch block in test wrapper

## Complexity: S
