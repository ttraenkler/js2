# #1184 — `__str_copy_tree` worklist over-allocates by `node.len` per flatten

## Problem

The iterative rewrite of `__str_copy_tree` in #1178 sizes its worklist at
`node.len` (total flattened string length) on every slow-path flatten:

```ts
// src/codegen/native-strings.ts (#1178)
// nodeLen is a safe upper bound on rope depth (≥ 1 char per leaf).
{ op: "local.get", index: NODE_LEN },
{ op: "array.new_default", typeIdx: wlArrTypeIdx },
{ op: "local.set", index: WL },
```

That bound is correct — depth ≤ leaves ≤ chars (since each leaf has ≥ 1
char) — but it's generous. For a 1MB ConsString with a balanced rope, the
actual depth is ~20, yet we allocate 1M ref slots × 8 bytes ≈ **8MB of
WasmGC array per flatten call**.

Concretely, every `String.prototype.charAt` / `charCodeAt` / `substring` /
`indexOf` etc. on a ConsString triggers `__str_flatten` →
`__str_copy_tree`, and each call allocates a fresh worklist sized at the
full string length.

## Scope of impact

`nativeStrings` mode only (`--target wasi` or explicit `--nativeStrings`).
The legacy `wasm:js-string` backend (default in JS-host mode, used by
test262) is unaffected — that's why CI on PR #64 didn't show this as a
correctness regression and why test262 conformance is unchanged.

Programs that build a long rope (`text +=` in a tight loop) and then read
characters in a hot loop will see GC pressure and per-call allocation
overhead. The labs `string-hash` benchmark surfaces this in its second
loop: `for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++) hash = ... + text.charCodeAt(i)`
becomes O(N²) total allocations because each charCodeAt re-flattens through
`__str_copy_tree` with a fresh `node.len`-sized worklist.

This is the perf side of #1178: the stack-overflow is fixed (constant wasm
stack frames), but the allocator now sees one large array per flatten.

## Root cause hypothesis

The worklist needs to hold pending right-children encountered during the
leftmost-spine descent. Maximum simultaneous size = rope depth, not
total string length. Three viable fixes:

1. **Dynamic growth**: start with a small array (e.g. 16 slots) and
   grow by 2× when full. Costs an extra branch per push and a copy on
   resize, but average-case allocation drops to O(depth).

2. **Fixed bounded stack with depth fallback**: pre-allocate a 64-slot
   array on the helper's stack frame; if depth exceeds 64, fall back to
   a recursive call (or to the current `node.len` allocation). Removes
   the allocation entirely for the common case (depth ≤ 64).

3. **Per-context shared buffer**: a single `(global (mut (ref $arr)))`
   that helpers reuse, growing only when a deeper rope is encountered.
   Zero allocation in steady state. Care needed for re-entrancy
   (helpers calling helpers during the same flatten — currently not the
   case for `__str_copy_tree`, but worth verifying).

Option 2 is probably the simplest and matches V8/SpiderMonkey rope
strategies (fixed-cap stack + recursive fallback).

## Reproduction

Compile any program that builds a 60K-char string via `+=` and then reads
characters in a hot loop, then run with `--target wasi`:

```js
export function run(n) {
  let text = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) text += "x";
  let h = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
    h = (h * 31 + text.charCodeAt(i)) | 0;
  }
  return h;
}
```

`run(20000)` on the post-#1178 build no longer traps (good!) but takes
much longer than expected — each of the 60K `charCodeAt` calls allocates
a 60K-slot worklist for the flatten path, even though depth is also 60K
in this degenerate case.

## Acceptance criteria

- `__str_copy_tree` allocates worklist storage proportional to rope
  *depth*, not rope length, for the common case.
- The labs `string-hash` benchmark (`run(20000)`) completes in well
  under 60 seconds on `wasmtime run` with `--target wasi`, returning the
  same hash as the Node.js baseline.
- `tests/issue-1178.test.ts` continues to pass (50K / 60K iteration
  cases remain trap-free).
- A new `tests/issue-1184.test.ts` measures wall-clock for `run(20000)`
  on the string-hash kernel and asserts < 5s (vs. the current >60s).
- Equivalence tests show no regressions.

## Key files

- `src/codegen/native-strings.ts` — the `__str_copy_tree` helper
  (currently lines ~150-385 after #1178). Look for the worklist
  registration (`getOrRegisterArrayType(ctx, 'ref_<anyStr>', ...)`),
  the `array.new_default` site, and the inner loop's `array.set` /
  `array.get`.

## Notes

- Keep the same correctness invariants from #1178: descend the left
  spine pushing right-children; on FlatString leaf, copy and pop; stop
  when worklist is empty.
- The peephole pass added in earlier work removes redundant
  `ref.as_non_null` after `ref.cast` — verify the new helper still
  benefits.
- Orthogonal to #1178's stack-overflow fix; this is purely an
  allocation-pressure optimization.
- Found during PR #64 / #1178 regression analysis (`net_per_test: +3`
  but 109 `compile_timeout` regressions in `nativeStrings` paths,
  later reclassified as drift since test262 doesn't enable that mode).
