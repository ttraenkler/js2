# #529: Speed up test262 runner with parallel workers + compilation cache

## Problem
The test262 runner at `scripts/run-test262.ts` needs optimization for faster runs.

## Requirements

### 1. Parallel fork workers
- Use `child_process.fork()` (NOT worker_threads)
- Pool of persistent workers that receive jobs via IPC
- Worker script at `scripts/test262-worker.ts`
- 30s timeout per worker -- kill and respawn if hung
- Workers inherit parent's `execArgv` for tsx loader compatibility

### 2. Compilation cache
- Hash (source string + compiler git tree hash) -> cache result
- Store cache in `benchmarks/results/test262-cache.json`
- On cache hit, skip compile+instantiate and return cached result
- Invalidate cache when compiler code changes (use git tree hash of `src/` directory)

### 3. Recheck optimization
- In `--recheck` mode, only re-run tests that previously had `compile_error` or `fail` status
- Carry forward `pass` and `skip` results unchanged

## Implementation Summary

All three features were already implemented in the codebase prior to this issue. However, a
path format bug was preventing the compilation cache and recheck optimization from working:

**Bug**: The main runner (`run-test262.ts`) computed `relPath` by stripping `test262/test/` from
file paths (giving e.g. `built-ins/isNaN/foo.js`), but the worker (`test262-worker.ts`) returns
`file: relPath` from `runTest262File()` which uses `path.relative(TEST262_ROOT, filePath)` and
produces paths with a `test/` prefix (e.g. `test/built-ins/isNaN/foo.js`). This mismatch caused:

1. Cache never populated -- the `jobs.find(j => j.relPath === r.file)` lookup at line 431 always
   returned undefined, so no cache entries were written
2. Recheck carry-forward broken -- `completedFiles.has(relPath)` never matched JSONL entries
   from worker results
3. Failure prioritization broken -- same path mismatch

**Fix**: Changed 3 regex replacements from `/.*test262\/test\//` to `/.*test262\//` so the main
runner preserves the `test/` prefix, matching the worker output format.

### What worked
- Verified cache populates correctly (20 entries after isNaN run)
- Verified cache hit on second run (0.0s per batch vs 3-4s per test)
- Verified recheck carry-forward works (12 pass/skip carried, 10 failures re-run)
- All JSONL entries now use consistent `test/` prefix path format

### Files changed
- `scripts/run-test262.ts` -- 3 lines: fixed path regex in `prioritizeTests()`,
  subset-run category deletion, and main test loop `relPath` computation

### Tests
- Verified with `--full isNaN`, `isNaN` (recheck), and cache hit runs
- No vitest test changes needed (scripts-only change)
