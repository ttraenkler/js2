# Local HTTP server for wasm source map stack traces

## Problem
Runtime errors (null pointer, illegal cast, caught exceptions) show no line numbers because V8 only resolves wasm source maps when loading from a URL, not from an in-memory buffer.

## Solution
1. Start a local HTTP server in test262-vitest.test.ts to serve compiled .wasm and .wasm.map files
2. Enable source map generation in the compiler worker
3. Write compiled outputs to test262-out/ directory mirroring test262 input structure
4. Use `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` from the HTTP server URL instead of in-memory `WebAssembly.instantiate`
5. Update `resolveWasmErrorLine` to parse V8's source-mapped stack format

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Enabled `sourceMap: true` in both compiler workers (`.mjs` and `.ts` versions)
- Added `sourceMapUrl` pass-through from pool -> worker so the embedded URL matches the served filename
- Added `sourceMap: string | null` to `PoolCompileResult` interface
- Created an HTTP server (node:http, random port, 127.0.0.1) that serves from `test262-out/`
- After compilation, writes `.wasm` and `.wasm.map` files to `test262-out/` mirroring the test262 directory structure
- Changed instantiation to use `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(url), imports)` with fallback to in-memory `WebAssembly.instantiate` if fetch fails
- Enhanced `resolveWasmErrorLine` to detect V8 source-mapped stack frames (e.g., `at test (test.ts:15:3)`) before falling back to manual byte-offset lookup
- HTTP server is shut down in `afterAll`
- Added `test262-out/` to `.gitignore`

### What worked
- The approach is clean: server starts once at module load, all tests share the same port
- Fallback to in-memory instantiation ensures no test breakage if HTTP serving fails
- Source map filename is derived from the test's relative path (e.g., `S11.6.1_A1.wasm.map`)

### Files changed
- `scripts/compiler-worker.mjs` - sourceMap: true, sourceMapUrl param, return sourceMap
- `scripts/compiler-worker.ts` - same changes + type annotation fix
- `scripts/compiler-pool.ts` - PoolCompileResult.sourceMap, sourceMapUrl pass-through
- `tests/test262-vitest.test.ts` - HTTP server, file output, instantiateStreaming, error parsing
- `.gitignore` - test262-out/
