# #2765 — instanceof hard residuals (two unrelated deep gaps)

Hard split of the #2740 umbrella — two distinct deep gaps grouped here per
tech-lead routing. Both surface through instanceof tests but are general
semantics gaps. Verified on current `main` 2026-06-28.

## Cluster 4 — `Function.prototype` "prototype" getter + WasmGC array prototype chain

`language/expressions/instanceof/prototype-getter-with-object.js`:

```js
Object.defineProperty(Function.prototype, "prototype", {
  get() {
    return Array.prototype;
  },
});
var result = [] instanceof Function.prototype; // expect true
```

`Function.prototype` is itself callable; OrdinaryHasInstance must read its
`prototype` (firing the installed getter → `Array.prototype`), then walk
`[]`'s prototype chain and find `Array.prototype` → `true`. Requires (a) the
getter on `Function.prototype.prototype` to fire through the dynamic instanceof
path, and (b) a WasmGC array (`[]`) to expose a real `[[Prototype]]` chain
reaching `Array.prototype`. We currently return false. This is a
prototype-chain / accessor-on-builtin-proto gap.

## Cluster 5 — undeclared-global read should throw `ReferenceError`

`language/expressions/instanceof/S11.8.6_A2.1_T3.js`:

```js
({}) instanceof OBJECT; // OBJECT undeclared → must throw ReferenceError
```

We treat an undeclared global read as `undefined`, so the instanceof returns
`false` instead of throwing `ReferenceError`. This is a **broad, cross-cutting**
semantic (it affects _every_ undeclared identifier read, not just instanceof
RHS) and is risky to change narrowly — scope carefully. May be wont-fix /
deferred depending on the cost-benefit of strict undeclared-reference semantics
in the WasmGC backend.

## Acceptance criteria

- Cluster 4: `[] instanceof Function.prototype` with a `prototype` getter
  returning `Array.prototype` → `true`; the getter fires exactly once.
- Cluster 5: `({}) instanceof <undeclared>` throws `ReferenceError`
  (or documented wont-fix with rationale if strict undeclared-read semantics are
  out of scope for the backend).
- No regression in the 28 instanceof tests currently green.

## Notes

- These are the two lowest-priority / hardest residuals of #2740; cluster 5 in
  particular may be deferred. Filed for tracking completeness.

## Reground (2026-07-02, dev-2912f, task #22)

Re-verified against current main (baseline jsonl + probes):

- **Cluster 4 is RESOLVED on main**:
  `language/expressions/instanceof/prototype-getter-with-object.js` now
  **passes** (landed with the recent instanceof/prototype-chain work — the
  `Function.prototype.prototype` getter fires and the WasmGC array reaches
  `Array.prototype`). No work remains here.
- **Cluster 5 still stands**: `S11.8.6_A2.1_T3` — `({}) instanceof OBJECT`
  with undeclared `OBJECT` returns `false` instead of throwing
  `ReferenceError` (probe-confirmed: undeclared reads still yield
  `undefined`). Unchanged assessment: broad cross-cutting semantic, candidate
  wont-fix; also interacts with #2763's undeclared-global assignment path
  (`A2.4_T4` needs the non-strict CREATE-on-assign to work while the bare
  read throws — the two must be designed together).

This issue now tracks ONLY cluster 5.
## ES2015 closeout correction (2026-08-26)

Cluster 4 is observable again once #4762 prevents the Test262 realm canary from
invoking the poisoned `Function.prototype.prototype` getter during cleanup.
The exact maintained host run `20260826-232826` no longer times out, but
`prototype-getter-with-object.js` fails because `[] instanceof
Function.prototype` is false after the getter runs. The authoritative
standalone run `20260826-194014` reports the same semantic failure. The throwing
and primitive sibling controls pass in the current host lane; standalone still
fails the throwing-object sibling because the expected abrupt completion is
lost.

Cluster 4 is therefore reopened. Its next checkpoint must pin getter count,
abrupt propagation, and the Array prototype-chain result in both lanes; it may
not restore the old cleanup timeout or treat a canary recycle as semantic
success.

## ES2015 cluster-4 implementation plan

1. Rerun the exact object, throwing-object, and primitive Test262 siblings in
   isolated host and standalone processes on the combined PR head. Record all
   six lane/path outcomes before changing code.
2. Reduce getter invocation, returned-prototype traversal, and abrupt
   propagation independently. Treat host cleanup/recycling as a control, not
   proof that compiled `instanceof` semantics passed.
3. Fix the shared OrdinaryHasInstance/prototype-chain path without a host
   oracle, fixture rewrite, skip, or special-case expected value. Do not touch
   cluster 5's undeclared-global behavior in this checkpoint.
4. Add permanent focused regressions requiring exactly one getter invocation,
   `true` for the Array-prototype object case, the original thrown object for
   the abrupt case, and `false` for the primitive control in both lanes.
5. Rerun the exact 3/3 rows in host and standalone and record the measured
   denominator in this issue before handing the commit to draft PR #5010.

## 2026-08-27 Luna/max handoff — cluster 4 remains open

The isolated `codex/2765-es2015-instanceof` worktree explored shared dynamic
`instanceof`, prototype reads/stores, closure dispatch, and runtime prototype
classification. The experiment did not converge to a verified checkpoint and
was stopped without integrating or pushing its uncommitted source edits.

The last completed exact three-row measurements were host run
`20260827-021225` at 2/3 and standalone run `20260827-030437` at 1/3. Both had
zero compile errors, compile timeouts, or skips. The host object case still
failed its true result after one getter call. Standalone still failed both the
object result and the throwing-object abrupt-completion case; only the
primitive control passed. These measurements are diagnostic only because the
worker continued editing afterward; they are not acceptance evidence for the
uncommitted experiment.

Handoff: restart from combined draft-PR commit `4e752a7f4`, reduce the object
prototype-chain result and throwing getter completion as separate mechanisms,
and add permanent focused coverage before widening shared prototype storage or
runtime classification. Do not reuse the isolated worktree's broad edits as a
checkpoint without first splitting and re-proving them. Cluster 4 and cluster
5 both remain open; no regression is claimed fixed by this handoff.

## 2026-08-27 Luna/max follow-up plan — split OrdinaryHasInstance mechanisms

1. Start clean from the current combined PR head; do not copy the prior broad
   uncommitted experiment.
2. Freeze the same exact three cluster-4 rows and reproduce host and standalone
   controls independently.
3. First isolate the returned object prototype-chain comparison. Only after it
   passes, isolate abrupt getter completion as a separate change. Preserve the
   primitive control throughout.
4. Limit edits to the smallest OrdinaryHasInstance/prototype-read seam and add
   permanent tests for getter count, returned prototype identity, and original
   thrown-object identity.
5. Rerun exact 3/3 host and standalone evidence. If either mechanism remains
   unsafe after the time box, commit an issue-only handoff and no source code.

## 2026-08-27 Luna/max final proof and issue-only handoff

The final isolated controls were run from combined head `114f8a95a` with the
three maintained cluster-4 rows only, `TEST262_WORKERS=2`,
`COMPILER_POOL_SIZE=2`, and the pinned QuickJS artifact
`/private/tmp/js2-quickjs-artifact-2e2d7736713beeda` for standalone execution.
The host control `20260827-035907` measured **2/3** (object-throws and
primitive passed; object failed), while the standalone control
`20260827-035555` measured **1/3** (primitive passed; object and object-throws
failed). The final standalone proof after the experimental source changes,
`20260827-043635`, remained **1/3**, with zero compile errors, compile
timeouts, or skips. No source fix is claimed by this checkpoint.

The host object failure is narrower than a false prototype walk: the getter
returns `Array.prototype`, but the compiled return coercion materializes that
host array as a fresh WasmGC vector and the host facade is not identity-equal
to the canonical `Array.prototype`. The diagnostic shape was
`valueType=object valueStruct=false array=true`, followed by a returned
prototype with `protoHostProxy=true`, `rawProtoStruct=true`,
`rawProtoVec=true`, `protoSameValue=false`, and only the `length` own key.
The existing native fallback then reads `target.prototype` a second time,
which explains the getter-count failure. The standalone throwing-object row
still loses the getter's abrupt completion and reports that no exception was
thrown.

The attempted narrow checkpoint added tri-state native `$NativeProto` probes,
an Array-prototype carrier marker, and a host carrier identity arm. It did not
change the authoritative standalone denominator or result, so all experimental
source edits were restored. TypedArray and class metadata paths were untouched;
cluster 5's undeclared-global behavior remains out of scope. The next agent
should model the returned-prototype identity/carrier and abrupt completion as
separate OrdinaryHasInstance mechanisms, then rerun the exact 3/3 controls
before adding permanent tests. This branch carries issue documentation only;
the parent agent should transplant the documentation commit onto a clean
upstream delivery branch and use a draft PR for the handoff.

## 2026-08-27 clean-delivery resumed implementation plan

This branch is the clean `upstream/main` delivery branch behind draft PR #5023;
do not copy the earlier combined-head experiment.

1. Add focused carrier-identity and abrupt-completion reductions before source
   edits. The getter must run exactly once in every case.
2. Resolve the object-result mechanism first: preserve the returned
   `Array.prototype` identity across the host/native carrier boundary and use
   that exact value for the prototype-chain comparison.
3. Resolve the standalone throwing-object mechanism separately, propagating
   the original thrown object without a boolean/default fallback.
4. Keep the primitive-return sibling passing and leave cluster 5 undeclared
   identifier semantics untouched.
5. Mark PR #5023 ready only after permanent focused tests pass and the exact
   maintained three-row slice is 3/3 in standalone with zero non-passes; retain
   host 3/3 as a regression control.

## 2026-08-27 clean-delivery no-gain disposition

The resumed candidate widened accessor returns to externref, classified
`Function.prototype` as a callable native prototype, added an Array-prototype
brand arm to dynamic `instanceof`, and preserved the already-read prototype in
the host fallback. Direct reductions exercised those paths, but the maintained
Test262 lowering did not improve, so none of those source edits is retained.

Authoritative standalone run `20260827-064940` recorded exactly three rows:
**1 pass / 2 fail / 0 compile error / 0 compile timeout / 0 skip**. The primitive
control passed; the object result remained false and the throwing getter still
lost its expected abrupt completion. Host solo runs `20260827-064356` and
`20260827-064758` each hit the runner's exact 10-second compile ceiling on the
throwing-object row while concurrent compiler-heavy tasks were active; they are
load-contaminated diagnostics, not acceptance evidence.

The source experiment, WAT instrumentation, probe-only test, and generated
report mirror were restored. PR #5023 has since merged; this branch therefore
does not attempt to update that PR or claim readiness. The next implementation
must first prove why the Test262 fixture bypasses the direct reduction's
carrier/classifier path before changing shared closure, prototype, or
`instanceof` machinery again.

## 2026-08-27 resumed native-instanceof experiment — no-gain handoff

The exact three maintained rows were rerun through
`scripts/harness-flip-probe.ts` with the positive pass/fail controls enabled
and the pinned QuickJS artifact
`/private/tmp/js2-quickjs-artifact-2e2d7736713beeda`. The uncommitted native
prototype experiment measured **standalone 1/3**: the primitive row passed;
the object-return row failed with `[] should be instance of Function.prototype`;
the throwing-object row failed because no `DummyError` was observed. Its host
run measured **0/3** (the object row failed its one-call assertion and the two
later rows hit `Cannot redefine property: prototype`), so it is diagnostic only
and not a host acceptance claim. The earlier isolated clean-source host
control remains **2/3** (throwing-object and primitive passed) and the clean
standalone control remains **1/3** (primitive passed), with zero compile errors,
timeouts, or skips in the accepted measurements.

Temporary source changes to accessor return representation, native
`Function.prototype` callability, native-prototype membership, and WAT probes
were removed after this run. A direct reduction showed that an ordinary
`"zz"` descriptor reaches the native companion, while the literal
`"prototype"` descriptor is absent from that companion and from own-name
enumeration. This isolates the remaining blocker to the compiler's special
literal-`prototype` define path; the native `instanceof` membership arm is not
yet exercised by the maintained fixture. No permanent focused test or source
fix is claimed. The branch carries this issue-only handoff and is ready for a
future clean implementation branch/new PR; cluster 5 remains out of scope.
