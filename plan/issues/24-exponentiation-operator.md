# Issue 24: Exponentiation operator

## Status: done

## Summary
Support the `**` operator and `**=` compound assignment.

## Motivation
`x ** 2` is common for squaring values, computing powers, etc. Currently unsupported.

## Design
`a ** b` maps to a host-imported `Math.pow(a, b)` call since Wasm has no native power instruction for f64. The import should be auto-registered like other Math builtins.

Special case: `x ** 2` could be optimized to `x * x` (but not required for correctness).

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — add `ExponentiationToken` case
- Ensure `Math.pow` is registered as a host import
- Tests: add to existing `tests/equivalence.test.ts`

## Complexity: XS

## Acceptance criteria
- `2 ** 10 === 1024`
- `9 ** 0.5 === 3` (square root)
- `let x = 2; x **= 3; // x === 8`
