# #730 -- Missing exception paths: 708 tests expect throws but code runs to completion

## Status: ready (wave 2)

## Problem

708 tests use `assert.throws(Test262Error, fn)` meaning they expect `fn` to throw a Test262Error but the compiled code runs without throwing. This indicates the compiler is silently succeeding where the spec requires an exception.

### Categories affected
- language/expressions: 152
- language/statements: 149
- built-ins/Array: 24
- built-ins/DataView: 20
- built-ins/Object: 17
- built-ins/Date: 15
- built-ins/String: 11
- annexB/built-ins: 9
- built-ins/Proxy: 7

### What needs to happen

1. Sample 50 of these tests to identify common missing-throw patterns
2. Implement the missing throw paths (likely: frozen object writes, sealed object extensions, read-only property assignments in strict mode)
3. Each sub-pattern becomes a targeted fix

## Complexity: L (many distinct throw paths to implement)
