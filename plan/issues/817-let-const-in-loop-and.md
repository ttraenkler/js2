# Issue #817: let/const in loop and try/catch bodies leak into outer scope

## Problem

When a `let` or `const` declaration inside a loop body (for, while, do-while, for-of, for-in) or a try/catch/finally block shares a name with an outer variable or parameter, the inner declaration incorrectly overwrites the outer variable's Wasm local slot.

This is because the compiler inlines block statements from loop/try bodies by iterating `stmt.statement.statements` directly, without calling `saveBlockScopedShadows` / `restoreBlockScopedShadows` that the standalone `isBlock` handler uses.

## Root Cause

In `src/codegen/statements.ts`, all loop compilation functions (compileWhileStatement, compileForStatement, compileDoWhileStatement, compileForOfStatement, compileForInStatement) and compileTryStatement have a common pattern:

```ts
if (ts.isBlock(stmt.statement)) {
    for (const s of stmt.statement.statements) {
        compileStatement(ctx, fctx, s);
    }
}
```

This inlines the block's statements without saving/restoring block-scoped name mappings. A `let x` inside the body allocates a new Wasm local but overwrites `fctx.localMap["x"]`, so after the loop, `x` refers to the inner local instead of the outer one.

## Fix

Added `saveBlockScopedShadows` / `restoreBlockScopedShadows` calls around all inlined block body compilations in:

1. `compileWhileStatement` (while loop body)
2. `compileForStatement` (for loop body)
3. `compileDoWhileStatement` (do-while loop body)
4. `compileForOfStatement` (for-of string iteration body)
5. `compileForOfStatement` (for-of array iteration body)
6. `compileForOfStatement` (for-of iterator body)
7. `compileForInStatement` (for-in body)
8. `compileTryStatement` (try block body)
9. `compileTryStatement` (catch block body)
10. `compileTryStatement` (finally block body)

## Impact

- Fixes 6 direct block-scope test262 failures
- Likely fixes additional failures where let/const in loop bodies caused incorrect values
- ~844 of 2000 "returned N" failures are `assert_throws` (expected exceptions that our runtime doesn't emit) -- separate issue
- ~1212 of 2000 failures are `dstr` (destructuring pattern) tests -- most are missing features, not this bug
