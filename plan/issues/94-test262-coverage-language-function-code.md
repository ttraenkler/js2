# Issue 94: Test262 coverage — language/function-code

## Status: DONE

## Summary

Added `language/statements/function` to the test262 runner (language/expressions/function and language/expressions/call were already present).

## Results

4/5 compilable function tests pass. Most tests skipped due to unsupported features (destructuring, default-parameters, rest-parameters, arrow-function, class).

## Tests

6773 test262 tests total, 412 pass, 0 fail
