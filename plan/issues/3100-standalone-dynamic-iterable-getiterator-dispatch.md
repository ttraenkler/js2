# #3100 — native GetIterator dispatch for dynamic iterables

## Problem (verified against origin/main @ 928c85179, 2026-07-09)

Iteration is native standalone for **statically-typed** iterables, but a
**dynamically-produced / `any`-typed** iterable has no native GetIterator
dispatch — the lowering either bakes a wrong `ref.cast` (trap) or leans on
host imports (`__array_from_iter_n`, `__gen_*`).

Probes (standalone, `nativeStrings`):

```ts
// typed — all native + correct:
for (const s of ["ab","c"]) …           // ✓ 3
const a: string[] = ["ab","c"]; for (const s of a) …  // ✓ 3
const o = {a:5,b:6}; for (const k of Object.keys(o)) …  // ✓ 2  (typed literal receiver)

// dynamic — traps:
const o: any = {a:5,b:6};
for (const k of Object.keys(o)) { n += 1; }        // TRAP: illegal cast (even without touching k)
for (const [k,v] of Object.entries(o)) …           // TRAP: illegal cast
// control: index loop over the same value works:
const ks = Object.keys(o); for (let i=0;i<ks.length;i++) n += o[ks[i]];  // ✓ 11
```

The `iterator_protocol` leak class is the **largest standalone bucket**:
8,156 files in the 2026-06-26 standalone JSONL (4,783 leaky-pass + 2,724
fail + 649 CE), carried by `__gen_*` (generator carrier — #2864, staffed),
`__array_from_iter_n` (4,348), and `__make_callback` (#3098). The generator
carrier work retires the `__gen_*` share; **nothing staffed owns the
"iterate a value whose static type is `any`/externref" dispatch** — this
issue.

## Root cause

The for-of lowering forks on the STATIC type of the iterated expression:

- typed vec struct → native indexed loop (fast path, correct);
- string → native char iteration;
- generator → carrier (native standalone since #2864 lane);
- **externref/`any` → there is no runtime classification arm.** The lowering
  picks a vec typeIdx from unreliable static info and emits
  `ref.cast $vec<T>` on a value that is actually a different carrier
  (`$ObjVec` keys array, boxed-any vec, host-shaped array) → `illegal cast`.
  `Object.keys(<any>)`'s result is exactly this shape, which is why the
  typed-receiver control passes and the `any` receiver traps.

This is the iteration twin of the #3053 reader-carrier convergence: the
_read_ side got a unified `__dyn_member_get`; the _iterate_ side still has
per-shape baked casts.

## Design — `__get_iterator` / `__iter_step`: one native iteration ladder

One pair of runtime helpers (standalone; host lane keeps its host protocol),
mirroring §7.4 GetIterator/IteratorStep and the #3031 Part-0 ladder order:

```
__get_iterator(v externref) -> externref   ;; an IterState carrier
  1. ref.test $Proxy        → trap-aware Get(v, @@iterator) → call → validate
  2. ref.test $vec family   → native index-iterator state {vec, i}  (incl. $ObjVec, boxed-any vec, string[] carrier)
  3. ref.test $Object       → Get(v, @@iterator) via __extern_get (finds user
                               iterators incl. shorthand `[Symbol.iterator]() {}` — needs #3099);
                               callable → invoke via __apply_closure; result must be Object else TypeError (§7.4.3)
  4. native string          → char iterator state
  5. generator/asyncgen carrier → the #2864/#2865 frame (already native)
  6. null/undefined         → TypeError "is not iterable" (catchable)
  7. else (host externref, gc lane only) → host GetIterator import (unchanged)

__iter_step(state externref) -> externref  ;; {done,value} carrier or done-sentinel
  fast arms for the index-iterator states (no per-step allocation for arm 2/4);
  protocol arm calls next() via __apply_closure and reads .done/.value through
  the dynamic reader (carrier-correct per #3053 — tag-6 for objects).
```

Consumers (each currently duplicating shape logic): for-of lowering
(`statements.ts` for-of externref arm), array destructuring from `any`,
spread of `any` (`[...x]`, `f(...x)`), `Array.from(x)` (retiring
`__array_from_iter_n` for GC-native carriers), `for await` (via the #2865
carrier), yield\*. Migrate them one consumer per slice; the helper is the
single place the ladder order and TypeError shapes live (same discipline as
#3031's `__chain_lookup`: one walker, refactor consumers onto it).

### Perf discipline

The typed fast paths are UNTOUCHED (the ladder is emitted only on the
externref/`any` arm that today traps or leaks). Arm 2 keeps iteration
allocation-free by reusing a mutable `{vec, i}` state struct; only the
protocol arm (3) pays per-step `__apply_closure`.

## Slices

| #   | Slice                                                                                                                                 | Scope                                             | Gate                |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| S1  | `__get_iterator`/`__iter_step` + arm 2 (vec-family) + arm 6; wire ONLY the for-of externref arm                                       | the probe traps flip; byte-inert for typed for-of | merge_group + floor |
| S2  | `Object.entries`/destructuring consumer (`for (const [k,v] of …)`)                                                                    | entries probe flips                               | same                |
| S3  | Arm 3 protocol dispatch (user iterators; depends #3099 for shorthand `@@iterator`)                                                    | manual-iterator for-of standalone                 | same                |
| S4  | Spread + `Array.from` consumers; retire `__array_from_iter_n` on GC-native carriers                                                   | leak count drop (4,348 files @ stale baseline)    | same                |
| S5  | Proxy arm (1) + IteratorClose on abrupt completion (§7.4.9 — coordinate with #3023's landed abrupt-completion work, do not duplicate) | `iterator-close` rows                             | same                |

## Edge cases

- **IteratorClose** on break/throw/return out of the loop body (§7.4.9) —
  call `return()` when present; the #3023 residual landed this for the
  existing lanes; the new ladder must route through the same close helper.
- `next()` returning a non-object → TypeError (§7.4.6); `done` coercion via
  truthiness; `value` absent → undefined singleton.
- Re-entrant iteration (nested for-of over the same vec) — per-loop state,
  never a shared global.
- Boxed-any vec elements must come back carrier-correct (tag-6 objects keep
  identity — #3037/#3053 contract), NOT re-proxied externref.
- Strings iterate by code point (§22.1.5.1), not code unit — reuse the
  existing native string-iteration arm.

## Dependencies / non-collision

Depends on #3099 (shorthand `@@iterator` visibility) for S3 only. #2864/#2865
own generator/async-generator carriers (arm 5 consumes their public shape;
do not modify). #3053 owns the read-carrier contract used by `__iter_step`'s
protocol arm. #3098 is independent (callback vs iteration) but shares the
`__apply_closure` invoke arm — land S1 of whichever goes first and reuse.

## Acceptance criteria

1. The three probe traps flip to correct results, host-free.
2. Spread/`Array.from` over dynamic GC-native iterables host-free (S4);
   fresh standalone JSONL shows `__array_from_iter_n` reduced to host-shaped
   receivers only.
3. Typed for-of paths byte-identical (WAT-diff a typed `for (x of arr)`).
4. Full merge_group + standalone floor (iteration is broad-impact).

## Effort estimate

L–XL total; S1/S3 are the Fable-grade design slices (ladder + protocol ABI),
S2/S4/S5 Opus-executable from the S1 template.

## Implementation notes (S1, landed 2026-07-09 — fable-3100)

### Verify-first repro (origin/main @ 825ffba1cf8d3)

All three probe traps reproduced exactly as specced (`illegal cast`):
`for (k of Object.keys(o:any))`, `for ([k,v] of Object.entries(o:any))`, and
`for (x of a:any)` where `a` holds `[10,20,30]`. Controls passed. Two spec
updates from the probes: (a) the **user-`@@iterator` probe already passes on
current main** (#3099 landed method-shorthand materialization + the #2038
USER arm covers it) — S3's "protocol dispatch" was already substantially
alive; (b) **spread of `Object.keys(any)` already passes** (the #2904
`__array_from_iter_n` non-vec guard routes indexable sources to
`__extern_length`/`__extern_get_idx`, which have carrier arms).

### Root cause, pinned to the instruction

WAT tracing showed the failing lowering is NOT in for-of consumer codegen —
the consumer correctly routes through the native `__iterator` /
`__iterator_next` runtime (iterator-native.ts, #1320/#2038). The trap is
inside **`__iterator` (GetIterator §7.4.1) itself**: its ladder accepted ONLY
the canonical externref `$Vec` (`ref.test` then arm) and the else-arm
**hard-cast to the same type** (`ref.cast $Vec<externref>` — the documented
Slice-1 "trap loudly" fallback). But:

- `Object.keys/values/entries(<any>)` return a **`$ObjVec`** (object-runtime
  enumeration carrier, structurally `{len i32, data ref $ObjVecArr}` but a
  DISTINCT type outside the `$__vec_base` hierarchy) → cast traps.
- an `any`-held array literal is a typed **`__vec_<elemKind>`** (probe: `const
a:any=[10,20,30]` builds `__vec_f64`, extern-converted) → cast traps.

This is the exact iteration twin of #2190's read-side gap (`__extern_get_idx`
had no typed-vec arms) and it has the same shape of fix.

### What S1 landed

**One normalize-at-GetIterator step; zero changes to IteratorStep.** At
finalize — when every module-local carrier type is registered, the same
reason `fillExternGetIdxVecArms` fills late — the renamed
`fillNativeIteratorLateArms` (was `fillNativeIteratorUserArms`) rebuilds
`__iterator` with **vec-FAMILY arms** between the canonical-vec arm and the
USER/trap tail:

- `$ObjVec` + every `ctx.vecTypeMap` carrier with a proven element-boxing
  recipe (reuses `boxVecElementToExternref` from #2190: f64/i32 →
  `__box_number`, externref → identity, `$AnyString`/`$NativeString` refs →
  `extern.convert_any`; everything else — boolean-tagged i32, non-string GC
  refs, packed `i8`/`i16` — is SKIPPED and keeps the legacy loud trap, never
  silently-wrong iteration). `i32_byte`/`i8_byte`/`i32_elem` byte carriers
  (ArrayBuffer/Uint8Array storage) are filtered out by key.
- Each arm copy+boxes the elements into a **fresh canonical externref
  `$Vec`** and returns the existing `$IterRec{VEC,…}` — so
  `__iterator_next`/`__iterator_rest` and every consumer are untouched. A
  copy (not an aliased rewrap of the carrier's data array) is deliberate:
  cross-type `struct.new` over structurally-identical-but-distinct array
  types would lean on engine iso-recursive canonicalization — the
  #2009/#2158 hazard class. O(n) once per GetIterator; steps stay O(1).
- The USER arm fill is now **independent** of the family arms (previously the
  whole fill bailed when the closed-struct dispatchers were missing; now a
  module with no custom iterable still iterates `Object.keys(<any>)`).
  `__iterator_next` is rebuilt only when USER deps exist (without the USER
  arm the kind is always VEC — family arms normalize INTO the canonical vec).

Why this locus and not the for-of lowering: every dynamic-iteration consumer
(for-of externref arm, `__array_from_iter_n` drain, future spread/`Array.from`
migration) already binds to `__iterator` by name — widening the ladder fixes
all of them at one chokepoint and is the "one walker, refactor consumers onto
it" discipline the Design section asks for. The issue's provisional
`__get_iterator`/`__iter_step` names were NOT introduced: `__iterator`/
`__iterator_next` ARE that ladder; a parallel pair would duplicate the ABI.

Discipline notes: fresh `Instr` objects per arm (factory style — the #2169b
shared-object double-remap hazard); the only baked funcIdx is `__box_number`,
resolved from funcMap at fill time exactly like the landed #2038 USER-arm
dispatcher funcIdxs; three scratch locals (`i`/`len`/`out`) are declared at
registration so the fill never grows the locals list.

### Arm-6 finding (null/undefined TypeError)

Under the current default value regime, `undefined` on the externref plane IS
`ref.null extern`, and the for-of consumer (loops.ts) already null-guards and
throws BEFORE calling `__iterator` — probe `for (x of null)` lands in `catch`
today. So a separate ladder arm would be dead code until the #2106
`undefinedSingleton` regime (flag-gated, default OFF) makes `undefined` a
distinct non-null singleton. Deferred to the #2106 flip lane: when the
singleton activates, add an identity arm (`ref.eq` against the
`$undefined` global) that throws a real TypeError.

### Validation (all measured, branch vs unmodified main)

- **Repro→fixed**: all 3 traps flip (`2`, `11`, `3`), host-free; 15-case edge
  probe (nested/re-entrant, break, empty, mixed elems, string vecs, Map,
  generators, typed arrays, function-returning-any) 14/15 — the 1 failure
  (`const [x,y] = a:any` fixed-arity dstr, "Cannot convert object to
  primitive value") reproduces IDENTICALLY on main: pre-existing, different
  lane (S2/S4 consumer, `__extern_get_idx` boxing), not a regression.
- **`tests/issue-3100.test.ts`**: 15/15 (10 fix cases + 5 regression guards),
  every case asserts ZERO host imports.
- **Byte-identity**: 10-program corpus (host arith/for-of/class/async/spread/
  dstr/`arr.values()`, standalone typed for-of/string for-of/typed
  `Object.keys`) — SHA-256 identical main vs branch. Only modules that
  register the native iterator runtime change bytes (that's the fix).
- **Scoped equivalence**: 30 iterator/spread/generator/dstr test files — the
  only failures (15+5) are byte-for-byte the same pre-existing set on main.
- **test262 clusters via `runTest262File` (standalone lane)**:
  `language/statements/for-of` (182 files: 81P/95F/6CE),
  `built-ins/Array/from` (47: 4P/26F/17CE),
  `language/expressions/assignment/dstr` (368: 228P/140F) — per-file status
  maps IDENTICAL main vs branch, zero flips either way. test262's untyped JS
  mostly presents checker-typed receivers to for-of, so the S1 population
  there is small; the S1 value is the user-code `any` shape (the probes) and
  the substrate for S2–S5 (S4's 4,348-file `__array_from_iter_n` retirement
  is where the JSONL leak-count drop is expected).

### Remaining slices (unchanged plan)

S2 largely subsumed (entries destructuring works via the S1 arm — probe
`[k,v]` sums values correctly); S3 protocol arm alive via #2038+#3099 for
closed-struct iterables (plain-`$Object` `@@iterator` residuals may remain);
S4 (spread/`Array.from` consumer migration onto `__iterator`, retiring
`__array_from_iter_n`'s bypass) and S5 (Proxy arm + IteratorClose §7.4.9
through the ladder) are open. Fixed-arity dstr from `any` (`const [x,y] =
a`) is a distinct pre-existing bug in the read lane — worth its own issue.

## Implementation notes (S4, landed 2026-07-09 — fable-3100s4)

### Re-grounding: the "4,348-file drop" was already banked

The S4 headline number was measured on the 2026-06-26 JSONL — the Slices
table itself flags it "@ stale baseline". Verify-first against the FRESH
standalone baseline (refreshed 2026-07-09, post-S1): `__array_from_iter_n`
leaks had already collapsed **4,348 → 60 rows** — #2904 (native materializer
+ per-site gating in destructuring-params/type-coercion) and the S1 ladder
did that work between the two baselines. Spread `[...any]` and
`Array.from(any)` (no mapFn) were ALREADY clean+correct standalone on
current main (probes: 3/3). What actually remained in the S4 consumer set:

- `[a, b] = <any>` **assignment**-form array destructure —
  `ensureLateImport("__array_from_iter_n")` in `compileExternArrayAssignment-
  Destructure` (assignment.ts) had NO standalone gate → `env::` leak.
  The 60-row `language/expressions/assignment/dstr` cluster.
- rest elements — FOUR consumers raw-`addImport`ed `env::__extern_slice`
  (assignment.ts, statements/destructuring.ts string-rest, loops.ts ×2):
  16 rows, and NO native `__extern_slice` existed at all (a loops.ts comment
  claimed one — it was aspirational).
- stray `env::__iterator`/`__iterator_next` ensureLateImport consumers
  (custom-iterable.ts, literals.ts, proto-override drives): ~40 rows, all
  co-leaking `__gen_*` (the #2864 lane) or iterator-prototype-introspection
  fails.
- `Array.from(any, mapFn)` (17 rows) — needs the callback bridge
  (`__make_callback`, #3098's lane). NOT taken here.

### What S4 landed

1. **ensureLateImport chokepoint routing** (late-imports.ts): under
   standalone/wasi, `__iterator{,_next,_return,_rest}` →
   `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime`, `__array_from_iter_n` →
   `ensureNativeArrayFromIterN`, `__extern_slice` →
   `ensureNativeExternSlice`. One place, every present AND future consumer
   binds native by name — the same discipline as the
   OBJECT_RUNTIME/UNION_NATIVE routes above it. (Must precede
   `refuseStandaloneObjectImport`: `__extern_slice` matches the `__extern_`
   refusal prefix.)
2. **`ensureNativeExternSlice`** (iterator-native.ts): index-based rest
   slice over the native read substrate — `len = __extern_length(src)`,
   copy `[start..len)` via `__extern_get_idx` into a fresh canonical
   externref `$Vec`; `$AnyString` arm normalizes through the #1470
   `__str_to_char_vec` (per-code-point, §22.1.5.1) then falls through to
   the same copy. Index-based rather than `__iterator`-ladder-based BY
   DESIGN: every consumer slices an already-materialized source, so
   protocol re-entry would double-step observable iterators; the indexed
   read is side-effect-free and inherits every carrier arm the read
   substrate has (#2190). Non-indexable → empty vec, never traps.
3. **Assignment consumer reads** (assignment.ts): standalone element reads
   via `__extern_get_idx(mat, f64 i)` — the native `__extern_get` is a
   string-keyed `$Object` reader; a boxed-number key misses every vec
   carrier (and the raw `env::__box_number` addImport would itself leak).
   Host lane keeps the boxed-key path byte-identical.
4. **String rest** (statements/destructuring.ts): `const [a, ...r] =
   "hello"` now builds the rest NATIVELY as a `string[]` nstrVec
   (`__str_to_char_vec` + `array.copy` tail, `srcOff` clamped for
   short-source `array.copy` bounds). The old lowering was broken in BOTH
   modes for the typed rest local: host `__extern_slice` can't slice an
   opaque WasmGC struct, and the externref result hit the pre-declared
   `string[]` local's `ref.cast $nstrVec` → illegal cast. WAT-traced to the
   exact cast before fixing.

### Measured (branch vs main @ 300fc5a, standalone lane, runTest262File)

- **69-file leak cluster** (`__array_from_iter_n` ∪ `__extern_slice` rows of
  the 2026-07-09 baseline): **37 files stop leaking entirely** (zero env
  imports); 13 keep OTHER co-leaks (`__gen_*`/`__make_callback`/Promise —
  the #2864/#3098 lanes); the rest were CE/vacuous either way.
- **945-file broad sweep** (assignment/dstr 368 + for-of/dstr 569 +
  assignment/destructuring 8): see PR body — zero unexplained flips; the
  only pass→fail flips are the two `array-rest-iteration.js` SHIM-ARTIFACT
  passes: `[...x] = <host-shim generator>` "passed" on main only because the
  leaked host `__array_from_iter_n` shim stepped the generator; those
  modules still leak `__gen_*` (cannot instantiate host-free at all), so the
  HONEST (host_free_pass) floor is unaffected. #2864's native generator
  carrier is the lane that re-flips them host-free.
- **Byte-identity**: 15-program corpus (9 host incl. `[a,b] = any` host
  path + 6 standalone unrelated) — SHA-256 identical main vs branch.
- `tests/issue-3100-s4.test.ts`: 17/17, every fix case asserts ZERO host
  imports.

### Follow-up seams found while tracing (NOT this slice)

- `__iterator` family arms skip `ref`-element vecs (vec-of-vecs:
  `for ([x,...y] of <any [[1,2],[3]]>)` traps `illegal cast` in `__iterator`
  — pre-existing S1 conservatism; extern.convert_any boxing for nested vec
  refs looks safe and would open the nested-destructure rows).
- `[a, ...r] = ("hello" as any)` never reaches the externref consumer —
  a different lane intercepts via the static string type and silently drops
  the pattern (module contains NONE of the iterator helpers). Pre-existing.
- for-of destructure over STRING elements (`for ([a,...r] of ["hello"])`)
  compiles the element pattern to an EMPTY block (silent drop, pre-existing).
- `f(...anyVec)` fixed-arity spread call emits invalid Wasm ("not enough
  arguments on the stack") — 1 test262 row, pre-existing.
- `Array.from(any, mapFn)` → 17 rows, blocked on the #3098 callback lane.

## Implementation notes (S5, landed 2026-07-09 — fable-3100s4)

### Scope shipped: IteratorClose §7.4.9 + custom-iterable consumer completion

Verify-first probes on post-S4 main: `return()` was NEVER called standalone
(for-of break/throw, assignment dstr, decl dstr — all `closed=0`), and the
custom-iterable CONSUMERS were value-broken too: `[x,y] = customIterable`
read nothing (the #2904 materializer guard passed closed structs through to
indexed reads), `[...customIterable]` / `Array.from(customIterable)` drained
EMPTY (`__iterator_rest` was vec-only). All fixed at the finalize fill:

1. `emitMethodDispatch("return", "__call_return")` (index.ts, one line) —
   emitted only when some struct carries a `return` method.
2. `__iterator_return` rebuilt with the USER close arm (dispatch
   `__call_return` on the record's userIter; every non-USER shape no-ops,
   never traps). The §7.4.9 "innerResult not an Object ⇒ TypeError"
   refinement deferred, matching the §7.4.4 note on `__iterator_next`.
3. `__array_from_iter_n` (shared `buildArrayFromIterNBody`): drainability
   guard widened at fill with the user-iterable closed-struct type tests
   (`collectUserIterableStructTypeIdxs` — `<S>_@@iterator` / `<S>_next` in
   funcMap, no runtime method invocation so no double-@@iterator); bounded
   stop with the iterator NOT done now calls IteratorClose — a DELIBERATE
   spec-following divergence from the host `_arrayFromIter` (#1592 no-close).
4. `__iterator_rest` rebuilt with a USER step-to-exhaustion drain arm
   (doubling-array via `__iterator_next`); exhaustion ⇒ no close ✓.
5. Spread-literal externref arm materializes first via
   `emitStandaloneIterableMaterialize` (new consumer helper in
   iterator-native.ts — passthrough for indexable carriers, protocol drain
   for custom iterables).

### Measured

- 14/14 close+consumer probes flip (close exactly once on break/throw/
  non-exhausting dstr; no close on exhaustion/already-done/no-return-method;
  dstr/rest/spread/Array.from values correct host-free).
- `tests/issue-3100-s5.test.ts` 18/18 (+ S4's 17/17 green), zero-import
  asserted per case.
- 945-file standalone sweep (assignment/dstr + for-of/dstr +
  assignment/destructuring), branch vs main @ e348f55: **zero flips either
  way, host_free_pass +0/−0**. Byte-identity corpus 14/15 — the single diff
  is the materializer module (the S5 rebuild target).
- **Why test262's `*-close.js` cluster did NOT flip**: those tests build
  iterators as PLAIN `$Object`s (`var iterator = { next: function(){}, … }`
  + a COMPUTED `iterable[Symbol.iterator] = fn` install). That's the
  dynamic-object protocol lane — invoking $Object-stored functions
  (#3098 `__apply_closure`/`__make_callback`) plus the S3 plain-$Object
  `@@iterator` residual — NOT the closed-struct dispatchers. They fail
  before close semantics are even observable. S5's value is the TS/user-code
  closed-struct lane (same population split S1 documented).

### Remaining (S5-residual / explicitly out)

- Proxy arm (ladder arm 1) — needs #1355 standalone Proxy infra; test262
  Proxy rows are skip-filtered anyway.
- Plain-`$Object` iterator protocol (test262 close cluster, ~57 rows) —
  needs $Object-stored-function invocation; belongs with #3098's callback
  lane or a dedicated S6.
