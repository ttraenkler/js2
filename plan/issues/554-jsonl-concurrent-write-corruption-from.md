# JSONL concurrent write corruption from parallel workers

The test262 runner uses parallel workers that send results back via IPC.
Previously, results were buffered per display-batch and written in bulk
via `appendFileSync` only after all workers in a batch completed. While
the writes themselves were serialized (single-threaded main process),
this pattern had two problems:

1. If the process crashed mid-batch, all buffered results were lost
2. The buffer/flush pattern was fragile and could be broken if future
   changes introduced concurrent batch processing

## Fix

Serialize all JSONL writes through a single file descriptor using
`writeSync`, writing each result line immediately as it arrives from
workers (via an `onResult` callback on `runBatch`). This guarantees:

- Each line is written atomically (single `writeSync` call per line)
- Results are persisted immediately, surviving crashes
- No interleaving possible even with concurrent worker IPC messages
- Signal handlers close the fd on SIGINT/SIGTERM

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added `openJsonlWriter`/`writeResultLine`/`closeJsonlWriter` helpers using
  a persistent file descriptor with `writeSync` for atomic line writes
- Modified `runBatch` to accept an `onResult` callback, called for each
  individual worker result as it arrives via IPC
- Replaced the `buffer[]` accumulation + bulk `appendFileSync` pattern with
  a `recordResult` function that writes each line immediately
- Added `closeJsonlWriter()` to SIGINT/SIGTERM/exit handlers
- Removed unused `appendFileSync` import

### Files changed
- `scripts/run-test262.ts`

### What worked
- Clean refactor: the `onResult` callback pattern integrates naturally with
  the existing `runBatch` promise-based API
- `writeSync` on a single fd is atomic per call in Node.js, preventing
  partial line writes from interleaving

### What didn't
- N/A -- straightforward change
