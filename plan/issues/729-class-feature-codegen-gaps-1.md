# #729 -- Class feature codegen gaps (1,161 tests)

## Status: backlog

## Problem

1,161 test262 tests fail on class body semantics with generic assertion failures. These are NOT prototype chain issues (#678) but rather class-specific features:

- Class field initializers (public and private)
- Static class members and static blocks
- Computed property names in class bodies
- Class expression name binding
- Class heritage (extends) edge cases
- Method definition semantics (configurable, non-enumerable)

### Test categories affected
- language/statements/class: 595 tests
- language/expressions/class: 566 tests

### What needs to happen

1. Audit class codegen for missing features
2. Implement class field initializers
3. Implement static blocks
4. Ensure methods are created with correct property descriptors (configurable: true, enumerable: false, writable: true)
5. Fix class expression name binding (class name is available inside class body)

## Complexity: L (>400 lines, multiple class features)
