# #514 -- Generator/async-gen "options is not defined" (~684 CE)

## Status: done

684 tests fail with compile error "options is not defined". This is the second-largest single CE pattern after "Unsupported call expression."

### Root cause

In `src/checker/index.ts`, the `analyzeSource` function parameter was named `analyzeOptions` but line 97 referenced it as `options`, which is undefined. This caused a runtime error "options is not defined" during compilation whenever `skipSemanticDiagnostics` was checked.

### Fix approach

Changed `options?.skipSemanticDiagnostics` to `analyzeOptions?.skipSemanticDiagnostics` on line 97 of `src/checker/index.ts`.

### Coordinates with
- #287 (generator compile errors)
- #412 (yield outside generator)

### Files to modify
- `src/checker/index.ts` -- options propagation

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

**What was done:** Fixed a parameter name mismatch in `src/checker/index.ts` where `options?.skipSemanticDiagnostics` was used instead of the correct parameter name `analyzeOptions?.skipSemanticDiagnostics`. This one-line fix (commit `4446cb86`) resolved 684 compile errors across generator, async-generator, Promise, Set, Map, computed-property-names, destructuring, and rest-parameter test categories.

**What worked:** Simple parameter rename fix -- the parameter was correctly named `analyzeOptions` in the function signature and used correctly on line 45, but line 97 had a stale reference to `options`.

**Files changed:** `src/checker/index.ts` (1 line)

**Tests now passing:** Up to 684 tests that previously failed with "options is not defined" compile error.
