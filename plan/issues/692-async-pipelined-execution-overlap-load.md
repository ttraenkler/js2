# #692 — Async pipelined execution: overlap load/compile/run stages

## Status: open

### Current: sequential per test
```
load(A) ──→ compile(A) ──→ run(A) ──→ load(B) ──→ compile(B) ──→ ...
            CPU idle      CPU idle    disk idle    CPU idle
```

### Goal: overlap stages so nothing sits idle
```
Time →  ┃ T1        ┃ T2        ┃ T3        ┃ T4        ┃
Load:   ┃ load(A)   ┃ load(B)   ┃ load(C)   ┃ load(D)   ┃
Compile:┃           ┃ compile(A)┃ compile(B)┃ compile(C)┃
Run:    ┃           ┃           ┃ run(A)    ┃ run(B)    ┃
Emit:   ┃           ┃           ┃           ┃ emit(A)   ┃
```

### Three levels of parallelism

**Level 1: Async I/O overlap (easy, Node.js native)**
Load is I/O-bound, compile/run are CPU-bound. Use `readFile` (async) to prefetch next test while current one compiles:

```typescript
async function* pipeline(tests: string[]) {
  let nextSource = readFile(tests[0], "utf-8"); // start loading first
  
  for (let i = 0; i < tests.length; i++) {
    const source = await nextSource; // wait for current
    if (i + 1 < tests.length) {
      nextSource = readFile(tests[i + 1], "utf-8"); // prefetch next
    }
    
    const compiled = compile(wrapTest(source).source); // CPU: compile current
    // next file is loading in background during compile
    
    if (compiled.success) {
      const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(compiled.binary, imports);
      const ret = instance.exports.test();
      yield { file: tests[i], status: ret === 1 ? "pass" : "fail" };
    }
  }
}
```
**Benefit**: Hides ~5ms disk read behind ~50ms compile. Small win but free.

**Level 2: Compile and run on separate threads (medium, worker_threads)**
Compile is synchronous and CPU-heavy. Running a Wasm module is also CPU. Using two threads per worker:

```
Thread A (compile):  compile(A) → compile(B) → compile(C) → ...
                           ↓ binary      ↓ binary     ↓ binary
Thread B (run):            run(A)    → run(B)     → run(C) → ...
                                ↓ result      ↓ result
Main:                           emit(A)  → emit(B)  → ...
```

Use a SharedArrayBuffer ring buffer between threads. Thread A pushes compiled binaries, Thread B pops and instantiates+runs. The pipeline never stalls unless compile is slower than run (which it usually is — so Thread B has slack time).

```typescript
// In worker:
const compileThread = new Worker('./compile-stage.ts', {
  workerData: { testQueue: sharedQueue }
});
const runThread = new Worker('./run-stage.ts', {
  workerData: { binaryQueue: sharedBinaryQueue }
});
```

**Benefit**: ~40% throughput increase. Compile and run overlap fully.

**Level 3: SIMD/parallel compilation (hard, requires compiler changes)**
Not for the test runner — but the compiler itself could parallelize:
- Type checking (already done by TS in one pass)
- Codegen for independent functions (each function is independent)
- Binary emission (can parallelize per-section)

This is a compiler architecture change, out of scope for the runner.

### Memory model for pipelined execution

```
Shared ring buffer (4 slots × 2MB = 8MB fixed):

  Slot 0: [source | compiled binary | result]
  Slot 1: [source | compiled binary | result]
  Slot 2: [source | compiled binary | result]  
  Slot 3: [source | compiled binary | result]

  Compile thread writes to slot[i % 4]
  Run thread reads from slot[i % 4] (waits via Atomics.wait)
  Main thread reads result from slot[i % 4]
  
  Each slot reused — no allocation after startup.
  Peak memory: 8MB fixed regardless of test count.
```

### Recommended implementation order
1. **Level 1** (async I/O prefetch) — 20 lines, immediate win
2. **Small batches from #690** — natural pipeline per batch of 50
3. **Level 2** (compile/run threads) — if Level 1 + batches aren't fast enough
4. **Level 3** — separate project, not for test runner

### Performance estimate

| Approach | Tests/sec | Run time (48K) | Memory |
|----------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Current (sequential) | ~10/s | ~80 min | 2GB/worker |
| Level 1 (async prefetch) | ~12/s | ~67 min | 300MB/worker |
| Level 1 + 8 workers | ~80/s | ~10 min | 2.4GB total |
| Level 2 (threaded) | ~16/s per worker | ~50 min (4w) | 400MB/worker |
| Level 2 + 8 workers | ~128/s | ~6 min | 3.2GB total |

## Complexity: S (Level 1), M (Level 2), XL (Level 3)
