# #406 — 'base' is possibly null errors (81 CE)

## Status: open

81 tests fail with TypeScript strict null check errors where 'base' is possibly null. This is a TypeScript type-checking issue leaking into the compilation pipeline.

## Details

The compiler's own TypeScript code has strict null checks enabled, and certain code paths access a `.base` or similar property that may be null/undefined. This is not a test262 test issue but an internal compiler robustness problem.

Common sites:
- Property access compilation where the object expression resolves to a nullable type
- Method call compilation where the receiver could be null
- Chain expressions (optional chaining `?.`) where intermediate values are nullable

Fix: Add null guards or non-null assertions at the crash sites, and handle the null case gracefully (emit a runtime null check or fall back to externref).

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] No "'base' is possibly null" compilation errors
- [ ] Nullable base expressions are handled with runtime null guards
- [ ] Reduce these CEs to 0
