# #778 -- RuntimeError: illegal cast (135 tests)

## Problem

135 tests fail with "illegal cast" — a Wasm `ref.cast` instruction fails at runtime because the value is not the expected struct type. Unlike null pointer traps (where the value is null), these are valid non-null values of the wrong type.

## Root cause

The codegen emits `ref.cast $StructA` but the runtime value is actually `$StructB` — a different struct type that happens to also have the accessed field. The multi-struct dispatch path (`findAlternateStructsForField`) should handle this but misses some cases.

## Fix approach

Extend the multi-struct dispatch to cover more property access paths, or use `ref.test` before `ref.cast` to avoid the trap.

## Acceptance criteria

- 135 illegal cast errors converted to either correct results or TypeError
- No new regressions
