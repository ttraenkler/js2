# #631 — Prototype chain tests fail (625 FAIL)

## Status: in-progress

625 tests involving prototype chain operations fail. Tests access properties through the prototype chain, use Object.getPrototypeOf, or depend on prototype-based inheritance patterns that our struct-based compilation doesn't support.

### Root cause
ts2wasm compiles classes to WasmGC structs with no runtime prototype chain. Property lookup is static (compile-time field resolution). Dynamic prototype chain traversal isn't supported.

## Complexity: L

## Implementation approach

Pragmatic approach: instead of a full prototype chain, handle the most common patterns:

### Implemented patterns

1. **`ClassName.prototype`**: Returns a singleton externref global, lazily initialized as a struct instance with default field values. Uses `extern.convert_any` to convert the struct ref to externref.

2. **`Object.getPrototypeOf(instance)`**: For class instances with known TS type, returns the class's prototype singleton (same as `ClassName.prototype`).

3. **`Object.getPrototypeOf(Child.prototype)`**: Returns `Parent.prototype` singleton by looking up the parent class in `classParentMap`.

4. **`instance.constructor`**: Returns a `ref.func` to the constructor function, converted to externref via `extern.convert_any`.

5. **`ClassName.constructor`**: Returns a `ref.func` to the constructor function.

### Identity semantics

Both `ClassName.prototype` and `Object.getPrototypeOf(instance)` return the SAME externref global, so `===` identity comparison works:
- `Object.getPrototypeOf(new Child()) === Child.prototype` -> true
- `Object.getPrototypeOf(Child.prototype) === Parent.prototype` -> true

### Not yet handled
- `Object.getPrototypeOf` on plain objects (returns null)
- `__proto__` property access
- Dynamic prototype chain walking
- `Object.setPrototypeOf`
