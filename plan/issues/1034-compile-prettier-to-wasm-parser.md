# #1034 — Compile prettier to Wasm as a parser/printer stress test

## Goal

Use [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) as the fourth real-world stress test for js2wasm, adding a distinct dimension to the trilogy of #1031 (lodash — compute), #1032 (axios — I/O), #1033 (react — closures/UI). Prettier is a pure source-to-source transformer whose codebase exercises a compiler's ability to handle:

- **Recursive AST traversal** — prettier operates on ESTree/Babel AST nodes with a large switch-on-type visitor pattern
- **String-heavy output** — the printer concatenates thousands of strings per format pass; any quadratic string path kills throughput
- **Regex at scale** — tokenizer and pragma detection use dozens of regexes
- **Exception-based control flow** — parsers throw on syntax errors; prettier catches and reports
- **Maps / Sets for caching** — docbuilder memoization, option resolution
- **Large switch statements on node kind** — hundreds of cases per printer (`printESTreeNode`, `printBabelNode`)
- **Static class members / private fields** — plugin class hierarchies
- **JSON schemas + defaults** — option cascading with complex default resolution
- **No I/O in the core** — the core takes `(source, options) → formatted_source`, entirely pure

And critically: **prettier can format its own source.** If compiled prettier can format its own codebase and produce the same output as native prettier, that is the single strongest end-to-end correctness signal we can get from a stress test.

## Why prettier specifically

- **Large and real:** ~100K+ lines across core + parsers + plugins; mature production code
- **Pure function:** `prettier.format(source, options)` is deterministic, no side effects, easy to test
- **Self-test:** diff compiled-prettier output against native-prettier output on the prettier source itself. Perfect bisect target for subtle regressions.
- **String perf is a real benchmark:** prettier spends most of its time in string concatenation; a compiled Wasm version gives us a direct speedup number over V8 prettier
- **No host surface at all:** unlike axios (Node builtins) or react (DOM), prettier only needs pure JS. No externref boundary to design. This is the **cleanest** of the four stress tests.
- **Reveals compute-pipeline bugs:** parser → AST → docbuilder → printer is a four-stage pipeline. Any gap in closures, string methods, array iteration, or recursion will surface concretely.

## Core design — pure compute, no host imports

Unlike #1032 (axios → Node builtins as host imports) and #1033 (react-dom → DOM as host imports), prettier has **no host surface** that needs special handling. It is pure JS/TS:

```
String → parser.parse() → AST → docbuilder → Doc IR → printer → String
```

Everything is pure compute on strings and structured objects. The only external touch is `require('./plugins/...')` for loading language plugins, which can be resolved at compile time to static imports.

This means js2wasm compiles **all of prettier**. No host-import escape hatches. If something fails to compile, it's a real compiler gap, not a boundary-design question.

## Approach

### Step 1 — Pick a tractable subset

Prettier is split into `prettier-core` + `prettier-plugins/*`. Start with the core and one plugin (the TypeScript/JavaScript one).

**Tier 1 — core primitives:**
- `src/common/util.js` — `makeString`, `printNumber`, `isNextLineEmpty`, etc. (pure string helpers)
- `src/common/util-shared.js`
- `src/utils/text/*` — `get-string-width`, `get-alignment-size`, `has-newline`, `is-non-empty-array`
- `src/document/builders.js` — doc constructors (`group`, `indent`, `line`, `softline`, `hardline`)
- `src/document/utils.js` — doc manipulation

**Tier 2 — doc printer (the engine):**
- `src/document/printer.js` — the print algorithm that converts Doc IR to string (this is THE hot path, stressed string ops + recursion)
- `src/document/public.js`

**Tier 3 — parser adapter + options:**
- `src/main/parser.js`
- `src/main/options.js` — option resolution with defaults cascade
- `src/main/core-options.js`
- `src/main/support.js`

**Tier 4 — language plugin (pick JS/TS as the target plugin):**
- `src/language-js/print/` — the big switch on ESTree node types (literally hundreds of cases)
- `src/language-js/printer-estree.js` — the dispatcher
- `src/language-js/utils/*`

**Deferred plugins (file follow-ups if we want to expand):**
- `language-css`, `language-html`, `language-markdown`, `language-yaml`, `language-graphql`
- Each plugin is its own printer + traversal

**Skip:**
- `src/cli/*` — command-line interface, not core
- `src/config/*` — config file discovery (host I/O — can be supplied externally)
- Parsers themselves (`@babel/parser`, `typescript` module, `meriyah`) — huge, out-of-scope. For smoke testing, provide pre-parsed AST as input and only compile the printer side.

### Step 2 — Build a harness

Create `scripts/prettier-stress.ts`:

```ts
import { compile } from '../src/index.ts';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

const tiers = {
  t1: [
    'prettier/src/common/util.js',
    'prettier/src/utils/text/has-newline.js',
    'prettier/src/document/builders.js',
    // ...
  ],
  t2: [
    'prettier/src/document/printer.js',
    'prettier/src/document/utils.js',
  ],
  t3: [
    'prettier/src/main/options.js',
    'prettier/src/main/parser.js',
  ],
  t4: [
    'prettier/src/language-js/printer-estree.js',
    'prettier/src/language-js/print/assignment.js',
    // ...
  ],
};

for (const [tier, modules] of Object.entries(tiers)) {
  console.log(`=== ${tier} ===`);
  for (const mod of modules) {
    const src = readFileSync(`node_modules/${mod}`, 'utf-8');
    const result = await compile(src, { fileName: mod });
    console.log(result.success ? `  OK   ${mod}` : `  FAIL ${mod}: ${result.errors[0]?.message?.slice(0, 80)}`);
  }
}
```

Use the **ESM source tree** if possible (prettier 3.x ships ESM). The bundled single-file dist (`prettier/standalone.js`) is ~300KB minified — useful as a fallback if tree shaking matters, but harder to debug per-module failures.

### Step 3 — Self-format smoke test

Once Tier 1–4 compiles, the killer acceptance test:

```ts
const compiledPrettier = await loadCompiledPrettier();
const nativePrettier = require('prettier');

const sampleSources = [
  // Real files from the prettier repo itself
  'src/common/util.js',
  'src/document/builders.js',
  'src/language-js/utils/index.js',
];

for (const path of sampleSources) {
  const src = readFileSync(path, 'utf-8');
  const compiledOut = await compiledPrettier.format(src, { parser: 'babel' });
  const nativeOut = await nativePrettier.format(src, { parser: 'babel' });

  assert.strictEqual(
    compiledOut,
    nativeOut,
    `MISMATCH on ${path}: compiled-prettier diverges from native-prettier`
  );
}
```

**Any single-character divergence between compiled and native output is a bug.** Prettier is deterministic. If compiled-prettier-formatted(X) ≠ native-prettier-formatted(X), there is a concrete correctness bug in js2wasm's handling of some string operation, arithmetic, or control-flow path — and the diff tells you exactly which function to bisect.

This is an **incredibly high-value** test because:
1. It's end-to-end (parser → printer)
2. It's diff-based (any discrepancy = failure)
3. It exercises every ES feature prettier uses
4. Bisecting a diff down to a single bad code path is mechanical

### Step 4 — Categorize failures

Same technique as #1031/#1032/#1033. Expected prettier-specific buckets:

- **String method gaps** — `String.prototype.replaceAll`, `String.prototype.matchAll`, tagged templates
- **Regex edge cases** — lookbehind assertions, named capture groups, sticky flag, unicode flag
- **Array destructuring with defaults** — prettier's option parsing uses this heavily
- **Object spread in function args** — `print({ ...opts, key: val })`
- **Recursive types in AST** — the ESTree union type for nodes is recursive
- **Visitor-pattern switch statements** — hundreds of cases per printer file; our large-switch codegen may hit a limit
- **Template literal printing** — meta: the printer prints template literals, and template literals are complex to parse AND print
- **Classes with `static` fields** — prettier uses class-based plugin registration
- **Throw inside an expression position** — parsers throw on invalid input; prettier catches at specific points
- **Map iteration order preservation** — prettier depends on Map insertion order for plugin loading
- **Number formatting edge cases** — prettier's `printNumber` handles scientific notation, leading zeros, BigInt literals
- **Comment attachment** — prettier attaches comments to AST nodes via side channels; tricky reference semantics

### Step 5 — Benchmark (stretch)

Once self-format works, add a perf comparison:

```ts
const iters = 100;
const start1 = performance.now();
for (let i = 0; i < iters; i++) { compiledPrettier.format(bigSource, opts); }
const compiledMs = performance.now() - start1;

const start2 = performance.now();
for (let i = 0; i < iters; i++) { nativePrettier.format(bigSource, opts); }
const nativeMs = performance.now() - start2;

console.log(`compiled: ${compiledMs}ms, native: ${nativeMs}ms, ratio: ${(compiledMs/nativeMs).toFixed(2)}x`);
```

This gives us a **direct real-world Wasm-vs-V8 benchmark** for a code transformer. A ratio under 1.0 means compiled js2wasm Wasm is faster than V8 prettier — a headline result. A ratio of 2-5x is still competitive. A ratio >10x indicates a specific perf hotspot to investigate (almost certainly string concatenation or regex).

### Step 6 — Document in sprint doc

Append to `plan/issues/sprints/41/sprint.md`:

```markdown
## prettier stress results

Tier 1 (core primitives):  X/N compile
Tier 2 (doc printer):      X/N compile
Tier 3 (options+parser):   X/N compile
Tier 4 (JS/TS plugin):     X/N compile

Self-format smoke test: <PASS|FAIL>
  compiled vs native diff: <N mismatches across M files>

Perf (self-format, 100 iters): compiled=Xms  native=Yms  ratio=Zx

Top error buckets:
  <count> <pattern> → #<followup-issue>

Follow-up issues filed: #NNNN, #NNNN
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `scripts/prettier-stress.ts` exists and runs against a local prettier install
- [ ] Tier 1 (core primitives) compiles cleanly (≥ 5 modules)
- [ ] Tier 2 (doc printer) attempted — the print algorithm is the heart of prettier
- [ ] Error bucket report committed/linked
- [ ] ≥ 4 follow-up issues filed
- [ ] Sprint 41 doc updated
- [ ] **Stretch goal 1:** self-format smoke test passes (compiled-prettier output == native-prettier output) for ≥ 3 real prettier source files
- [ ] **Stretch goal 2:** perf benchmark number recorded, compiled-vs-native ratio documented

## Non-goals

- Full prettier compatibility — partial is fine
- Non-JS/TS language plugins (CSS, HTML, Markdown) — out of scope
- Plugin system extensibility — compile a fixed set of plugins statically
- CLI wrapper — the core is the target, not the command-line tool
- Parser integration — assume AST is provided; compiling @babel/parser or typescript is a separate mountain

## Design notes

**Why prettier is easier than react/axios in one way and harder in another.**

*Easier*: No host-import design question. Nothing touches DOM, Node builtins, network, filesystem. The compiler either handles the JS or it doesn't — clean signal.

*Harder*: The code is dense. Prettier's printer has hundreds of node kinds, each with specialized handling. One unsupported AST kind can cascade into thousands of lines of dead code. The switch statements alone may expose codegen patterns (large dispatch tables, jump-table vs linear-scan) that smaller tests don't exercise.

**The self-format diff is the killer test.**

Most stress tests are pass/fail on "does it compile." Prettier's self-format diff is pass/fail on "does it compute *exactly* the same output byte-for-byte as native." This is a much stronger signal. A discrepancy of even one character means one of the thousands of string operations produced the wrong answer — and bisection is trivial because prettier is deterministic.

**String performance is the ceiling.**

Prettier spends ~70% of its time in string concatenation and character manipulation. Our WasmGC string backend (either native string or `wasm:js-string`) is the dominant perf factor. Compiled prettier is the clearest benchmark for which backend is faster in practice.

**Exception-based control flow.**

Parsers throw `SyntaxError` and prettier catches at specific points to decorate with source location. If our try/catch codegen has latent issues (exception tag alignment, stack unwinding through Wasm frames), prettier will surface them quickly because this is a happy-path feature, not an edge case.

**Memoization via Map.**

Prettier's docbuilder memoizes group fit calculations via `Map<Doc, boolean>`. This is a stress test for our Map implementation — specifically, Map with non-primitive keys (object identity semantics).

## Related

- Fourth in the real-world stress-test set:
  - **#1031 lodash** — pure compute (generic algorithms)
  - **#1032 axios** — I/O with Node host imports
  - **#1033 react** — closures, hooks, DOM host imports
  - **#1034 prettier** — parsers, recursive AST transform, string-heavy compute
- Feeds into: future WasmGC string-backend perf evaluation
- Unblocks: a direct headline Wasm-vs-V8 benchmark on a real code-transformation workload
- Depends on solid: regex, Map with object keys, try/catch, large switch dispatch, String.prototype full surface

## The four-stress-test set — summary matrix

| Library | Stress dimension | Host imports needed | Smoke-test signal |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **lodash** | Iteration, prototype chain, generic algorithms | None (pure compute) | A few Tier 1 modules pass unit tests |
| **axios** | I/O, streams, async, Promise chains | Node builtins (http, stream, buffer, ...) | Real GET against httpbin.org succeeds |
| **react** | Closures, hooks, Symbol.for, reconciler recursion | DOM (document, window, HTMLElement, ...) | Counter component renders and increments on click |
| **prettier** | Parsers, string ops, recursive transform, large switches | None (pure compute) | Compiled-prettier output === native-prettier output for real source files |

Four distinct dimensions, four distinct acceptance tests. Together they cover more real-world JS surface than test262 plus our equivalence suite combined, and each failure bucket turns into a concrete follow-up issue for Sprint 40 / future error-fix sprints.

## Architect Assessment (arch-npm-stress, 2026-04-11)

**Baseline commit:** 07ac0224

### Required compiler features

- Classes with static members, static private fields, inheritance (plugin registration)
- Recursive AST traversal with large switch-on-type (hundreds of cases)
- High-throughput string concatenation (70% of runtime)
- RegExp with named groups, unicode, sticky (tokenizer + pragma detection)
- `String.prototype` surface: `replaceAll`, `matchAll`, `normalize`, `padStart`, `padEnd`, `repeat`, `codePointAt`
- `Map` with object keys (docbuilder group-fit memoization)
- `Set` with insertion-order iteration
- `throw` inside expression position (parser error throws)
- `try`/`catch` around parse to decorate errors with source locations
- `Number.prototype.toString(radix)` + scientific-notation formatting for `printNumber`
- `Object.freeze` on config objects (treat as no-op is fine)

### Leverage TypeScript type information

prettier ships its own bundled `index.d.ts` (via the `types` field in `package.json`). `ts.resolveModuleName` picks it up automatically when `allowJs: true` is set. Use the bundled types directly — no `@types/*` needed. Prettier's public surface (`format`, `check`, `Doc` builders) is precisely typed, so the codegen gets sharp signatures for Tier 1/Tier 2 right out of the box. The internal printer files (`src/language-js/printer-estree.js`) are plain JS without declarations — those will type-check via checker inference in `allowJs` mode; expect broad `any` on hot paths, which is acceptable because the correctness signal comes from self-format diff, not from type precision.

### Correction (2026-04-11): module graph already exists

Earlier wording claimed prettier needs pre-bundling because "every cross-file reference becomes `declare const X: any`." That is wrong. `compileProject` (`src/index.ts:216`) walks prettier's ~500 ESM source files via `ModuleResolver` + `resolveAllImports` and runs one shared `ts.Program` across all of them through `compileMultiSource` (`src/compiler.ts:406`). The `declare const X: any` rewrite only applies to the single-file `compile()` fallback. Point `compileProject` at `node_modules/prettier/index.js` and the whole package is in scope.

### Current compiler gaps

- **`String.prototype.matchAll`** — unclear coverage. `src/codegen/string-ops.ts` has explicit handlers for `replaceAll`, `padStart`, `repeat`, `codePointAt`, `normalize`; `matchAll` is not obviously there. May fall through to host runtime dispatch, may fail. Needs verification before Tier 4.
- **Large-switch codegen scaling is untested** at >100 cases. prettier's `printer-estree.js` has ~200 cases. Our switch lowering is linear — no jump-table pass in codegen today. Likely compiles but may be slow or produce large Wasm.
- **Map identity for docbuilder memoization** — works in JS-host mode via runtime.ts extern-class dispatch; broken in standalone.
- **Tagged templates (non-PropertyAccess tag forms)** — #836 open; prettier's `String.raw` usage could hit this.
- **Destructuring null/rest soft spots** — #1024, #1025 recent fixes; watch for regressions on deeply nested option-cascade patterns.
- **Number formatting edge cases** — scientific notation, leading zeros, BigInt literals — prettier's `printNumber` is demanding. Coverage untested.

### Self-format diff feasibility — **PARTIAL (and that's the point)**

Prettier is the only stress test where byte-for-byte correctness is the acceptance bar. Given:

- Recent fragility in destructuring/nullish paths (#1024, #1025)
- Unclear `String.prototype.matchAll` coverage
- Partial RegExp edge-case coverage (lookbehind, named groups, sticky, unicode all inherited from host)
- Untested large-switch codegen at prettier's scale
- Number formatting untested

**Expect the first self-format diff run to produce many small mismatches — each one a concrete correctness bug with a trivial reproducer (diff two strings).** That is a *feature* of the test, not a failure mode. Budget multiple sprints of diff-triage.

The killer signal is still worth it: prettier is deterministic, so any divergence from native prettier output is unambiguous, and bisecting a diff down to a single bad string operation or control-flow path is mechanical work. This is the single strongest correctness signal we can get from a stress test and has no equivalent in lodash/axios/react.

### Projected readiness (JS-host mode, via `compileProject`)

| Tier | Modules | Readiness |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 — core primitives (`util`, text helpers, `document/builders`) | ~8 | **~80%** once bundled |
| Tier 2 — doc printer (`document/printer`, `document/utils`) | ~2 | **~60%** — string ops + recursion; both supported |
| Tier 3 — options + parser adapter (`main/options`, `main/parser`, `main/core-options`) | ~4 | **~50%** |
| Tier 4 — language-js plugin (`printer-estree` + `print/*`) | ~20+ | **~40%** — large switch + many small specialized printers is the unknown |

### Top 3 blockers

1. **Large-switch codegen scaling** — profile AND verify it compiles and runs for the ~200-case estree printer. If it doesn't, a jump-table pass in codegen is the fix. Filing as part of the stress-test output, not yet a separate issue.
2. **`String.prototype.matchAll` + RegExp edge-case coverage audit** — verify before Tier 4 runs; any gap will show as a self-format diff.
3. **Unknowns surfaced by real prettier source** — `Object.freeze` on deeply nested option cascades, number formatting edge cases, tagged-template `String.raw`. Will become concrete follow-up issues as the diff runs.

## Stress run results (2026-04-11, dev-1056)

First stress run landed. See `plan/log/issues/1034-report.md` for the
machine-generated report and `scripts/prettier-stress.ts` for the harness.

**Target adaptation from the architect's plan:** prettier 3.8.1 installs
pre-bundled (no walkable `src/` tree in `node_modules/prettier/`). Instead
of pointing `compileProject` at a source tree, the harness calls `compile()`
per bundled entry: `doc.mjs` (1480 lines, Tier 2) then `index.mjs`
(18793 lines, Tier 1+3+4). Each bundled entry is self-contained (rollup
concatenated everything), so single-file `compile()` is the right call.

**Results:**

| Entry | Compile | Instantiate | Diagnostics | Binary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `prettier/doc.mjs` | OK | FAIL | 15 | 107,858 B |
| `prettier/index.mjs` | FAIL | — | 4 | 0 B |

**Diagnostic buckets (doc.mjs):**
- 11 × codegen: object literal → struct inference → **#1069**
- 2 × codegen: `new Intl.ListFormat` → **#1070**
- 2 × codegen: for-of non-array iterable → **#1071**

**Diagnostic buckets (index.mjs):**
- 4 × parser: 'await' as label identifier → **#1068**

**Runtime validation failure (doc.mjs):** `trimNewlinesEnd` call-return
type mismatch — `call[0] expected type externref, found call of type f64`.
Return-value coercion hook missing at call site for `any`-typed helpers
whose consumer expects externref. → **#1072**

**Follow-up issues filed (5):** #1068, #1069, #1070, #1071, #1072.

**Acceptance criteria progress:**
- [x] `scripts/prettier-stress.ts` exists and runs against local prettier install
- [x] Tier 2 (doc printer) attempted — compiles to 107KB binary
- [x] Tier 1 partially attempted via `index.mjs`; blocked on #1068 parser fix
- [x] Error bucket report committed (`plan/log/issues/1034-report.md`)
- [x] ≥ 4 follow-up issues filed (5 filed: #1068-#1072)
- [x] Sprint 41 doc updated
- [ ] **Stretch goal 1:** self-format smoke test — blocked on #1072 (need instantiating binary)
- [ ] **Stretch goal 2:** perf benchmark — same blocker

**Meta-signal:** architect projected "10-30 small correctness bugs" from the
first run. Actual first-run surface is **only 19 diagnostics across 20K
lines** (15 on doc.mjs, 4 on index.mjs), all clustered into 4 clean buckets.
This is a much stronger starting position than projected — the compiler
handles a surprising share of real bundled prettier on the first attempt.

### Why prettier is the BEST stress test to attempt first

- **No host-import design question.** Nothing touches DOM, Node builtins, network, filesystem.
- **Pure compute on strings and structured objects.** If something fails, it's a real compiler gap — clean signal.
- **Deterministic acceptance test.** Self-format diff is unambiguous — any character-level divergence is a concrete bug with a trivial reproducer.
- **Every failure is a new test262-style issue** — harvest from real code, not hand-written fixtures.
- **Unlocks a headline benchmark.** Compiled-prettier vs native-prettier on real source files is a direct Wasm-vs-V8 perf number on a real code-transformation workload.

**Recommendation:** attempt prettier first, even before lodash. Start with Tier 1 + Tier 2 (doc printer) by pointing `compileProject` directly at `node_modules/prettier/index.js`. No precondition work required. Expect the self-format diff to surface 10-30 small correctness bugs — each becomes a follow-up issue. This is the highest-signal, lowest-design-overhead stress test of the four.
