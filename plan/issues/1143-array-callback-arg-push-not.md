## Problem

Array method callbacks (map, filter, forEach, etc.) push all available arguments (value, index, array) regardless of how many the callback actually declares. This caused incorrect codegen when callbacks declared fewer than 3 params — extra values were pushed onto the Wasm stack.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Callback arg push gated on `paramTypes.length`
- [x] Callbacks with 1 or 2 params receive only the args they declare

## Implementation

Merged via PR #228 (branch `issue-array-index-call-coerce`).
