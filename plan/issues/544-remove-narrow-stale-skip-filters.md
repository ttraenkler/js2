# Remove/narrow stale skip filters

## Problem

Multiple skip filters in `tests/test262-runner.ts` are stale or overly broad, hiding tests
that now pass or would safely compile-error/fail without hanging.

## Filters to remove

Based on empirical testing (compile + run all matched files, check for hangs):

1. **arrow returning undefined** (1 test, 100% pass)
2. **Math.round large-number precision edge case** (1 test, 100% pass)
3. **function expression in catch scope** (26 tests, 85% pass, 0 hangs)
4. **nested function/catch scope with type mismatch** (48 tests, 25% pass, 0 hangs)
5. **this.property at global scope** (26 tests, 20% pass, 0 hangs)
6. **global/arrow this reference** (114 tests, 15% pass, 0 hangs)
7. **arithmetic on objects** (5 tests, 20% pass, 0 hangs)
8. **string comparison with supplementary unicode** (5 tests, 40% pass, 0 hangs)
9. **array index with string concat in loop** (3 tests, 33% pass, 0 hangs)
10. **loose equality between array references** (all CE, 0 hangs)

## Filters to narrow

11. **JSON.stringify replacer/space args** -- only check executable code, not metadata/comments.
    Went from 44 to 7 matched tests (37 unblocked).

## Total tests unblocked

~266 tests unblocked from skip. Estimated ~40+ new passes.
