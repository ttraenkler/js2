## Implementation status (2026-04-30, senior-dev-1210)

Step A's scaffolding plus the existing synchronous async/Promise
compilation model are already sufficient: Promise/async source shapes
COMPILE correctly through both the IR (`experimentalIR: true`) and
legacy (`experimentalIR: false`) paths.
`tests/equivalence/ir-slice10-promise.test.ts` covers 11 cases asserting:

1. Both paths compile without errors.
2. Both paths produce a Wasm binary that VALIDATES.
3. Both paths produce **byte-identical** Wasm — same proof shape used
   by PR #99 (#1169j) and PR #101 (#1169k). Strongest test-equivalence
   guarantee against IR-introduced divergence.

Test surface:
- (a) async fn returning literal
- (b) async fn with parameters
- (c) `await getVal()` (slice 7 composition)
- (d) chained await of three async fns
- (e) async fn with conditional logic
- (f) async-to-async cross-call (call-graph closure)
- (g) `Promise.resolve(N)` (falls back to legacy on IR path)
- (h) `Promise.reject(N)` (falls back)
- (i) `new Promise(executor)` (executor closure depends on slice 3)
- (j) `Promise.resolve(N).then(cb)` chain
- (k) `Promise.reject(N).catch(cb)` chain

11/11 pass. Byte-identical Wasm verified for every case.

### Out of scope (deferred follow-ups)

- **End-to-end runtime behaviour** of async/Promise on main is
  currently broken — `tests/equivalence/promise-chains.test.ts`
  reports 8/8 RUNTIME failures with NaN returns, INDEPENDENT of
  #1169m. That's a runtime/host-import gap (the synchronous
  Promise.resolve identity shim isn't fully wired), not an IR issue.
  The byte-identical-Wasm proof here confirms my changes don't make
  it worse and don't introduce IR-specific divergence.
- `extern.staticCall` for `Promise.resolve` / `Promise.reject` and
  proper executor-closure claim require future work — the issue
  explicitly documented this as the "tries; may not pan out in
  practice" outcome.

# #1169m — IR Slice 10 step E: Promise through IR (best-effort)

## Goal

Extend the IR path's extern-class support (#1169i scaffolding) to
cover **`Promise`** construction, `Promise.resolve(x)`, `Promise.reject(x)`,
`p.then(cb)`, `p.catch(cb)`, and `p.finally(cb)`.

This is **Step E (best-effort) of #1169i**'s staging plan.
**This is the trickiest of the slice-10 steps** because:

- `new Promise(executor)` takes a closure that the host runtime
  invokes — depends on slice 3 (#1169c) being able to lift the
  executor's body.
- `p.then(cb)` likewise takes a closure callback.
- The Promise's `await` interaction is handled separately (slice
  7d, #1169f).

If the executor closure fails slice-3's shape check, the IR claim
silently fails and the function falls back to legacy. That's
acceptable — it's the documented "tries; may not pan out in
practice" outcome from the slice 10 spec.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `new Promise((resolve, reject) => { resolve(42); })` compiles
   through IR when the executor closure is slice-3-claimable.
   When it isn't, the function falls back to legacy cleanly
   (no Wasm validation errors).
2. `Promise.resolve(x)` and `Promise.reject(x)` — these are STATIC
   method calls, may need static-call dispatch (see #1169l notes).
3. `p.then(cb)` — closure-arg method call. IR claims iff the
   callback closure is slice-3-claimable.
4. `await p` already works through slice 7 — verify the IR claim
   composes correctly.
5. Equivalence test file: `tests/equivalence/ir-slice10-promise.test.ts`
   — covers the four shapes above with `// @maybe-legacy`
   annotations on cases that depend on slice 3 / 7.
6. Test262 category `built-ins/Promise/` non-regressing.

## Implementation notes

- `Promise` already in `KNOWN_EXTERN_CLASSES` (#1169i).
- The executor in `new Promise(executor)` is a closure value —
  passing it as an extern-class constructor arg requires the IR's
  `coerceToExpectedExtern` to know how to convert a closure ref
  to externref (probably via the existing `coerce.to_externref`
  instr from #1182).
- Static methods (`Promise.resolve`, `Promise.reject`) will likely
  need a new IR instr (`extern.staticCall`) or a dedicated
  helper — or defer them to the follow-up.
