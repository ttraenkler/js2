# #1666 — `--target wasi` produces invalid (non-instantiable) Wasm for several constructs

> **REVERTED by #618** (the eager `fixupModuleFuncIndices` in `addImport`
> corrupted the default-GC trampoline path → −3,600 test262). Re-land must
> scope the func-index fixup so it never re-shifts already-emitted bodies in
> the default (non-standalone) path. See #1668.
>
> **SAFE RE-LAND (2026-05-27) — DONE.** Signature B (unbound late global) is
> re-landed with a mode-agnostic, no-func-index-bookkeeping fix that does
> NOT touch the trampoline shift path — it cannot reproduce the #618
> regression. Signature A (native string helper func-index shift
> collisions) is the actual #618 shift-regime hazard and is **explicitly
> carved out** to a follow-up architect-routed issue (see "Remaining —
> Signature A" below); it is NOT in this re-land.

## Problem

Beyond host-import leaks, the standalone audit (#1662) found a distinct
**correctness** bug: several constructs that should lower to pure WasmGC
emit a `.wasm` that **fails `WebAssembly.compile` validation** under
`--target wasi`. The byte stream is malformed, not merely missing an import.

Two failure signatures recur:

### Signature A — native string helper type mismatch

```
Compiling function #N:"__str_flatten"  failed: call[k] expected type <T>, found <U>
Compiling function #N:"__str_to_extern" failed: call[0] expected type f64, found local.get
```

Reproducers (`.tmp/probes/`):
| Probe | Error |
|---|---|
| `array-map` (`.map().filter().reduce()`) | `__str_flatten` call[0] expected i32, found local.get |
| `class` (`extends`/`super`) | `__str_flatten` call[1] expected externref, found i31 |
| `closure` (captured local) | `__str_flatten` call[0] expected i32, found local.get |
| `str-replace-re` | `__str_flatten` call[1] mismatch |
| `str-template` (`` `${x}` ``) | `__str_to_extern` call[0] expected f64, found local |
| `generator` | `__str_flatten` type error |

The `__str_flatten` / `__str_to_extern` native-string helpers are being
called with arguments of the wrong Wasm type — the call site builds a
stack shape that doesn't match the helper signature. Likely the native
string path and the (still-present) host-boxing path are being mixed: a
value is boxed for the JS-host helper signature but then fed into the
native helper, or vice versa.

### Signature B — unbound late global (index 0xffffffff)

```
Compiling function #N:"test" failed: Invalid global index: 4294967295 @+offset
```

Reproducers:
| Probe | Error |
|---|---|
| `numstr` (`.toFixed`/`.toString(16)`) | Invalid global index 4294967295 |
| `string-ctor` (`String(42)`) | Invalid global index 4294967295 |
| `uint8` (`Uint8Array.set/.subarray`) | Invalid global index 4294967295 |

`4294967295` = `-1` = an unresolved/placeholder late global index that was
never patched. A global is referenced before (or without) being registered
— the late-global fixup that runs for the JS-host path doesn't run (or
runs with a stale base) on the WASI native path.

## Impact

These constructs are *unusable* in standalone/WASI today — they don't even
instantiate, regardless of whether a JS host is present. This is more severe
than a host-import leak (which at least instantiates given the host). The
audit had to use a tolerant raw import-section parser to see the leaks
because the modules fail full validation.

## Investigation starting points

- **Signature A**: `src/codegen/native-strings.ts` (`__str_flatten`,
  `__str_to_extern` emitters) and the number→string / concat call sites that
  invoke them. Check whether `noJsHost = ctx.wasi || ctx.standalone`
  consistently selects the native helper signature at *both* the helper
  definition and every call site. The number→string path (#1335) and the
  template-literal/`String()` concat path are prime suspects.
- **Signature B**: the late-global registration + fixup (search for global
  index assignment and the `0xffffffff` / `-1` placeholder). Compare the
  JS-host code path (which works) against the WASI path for `.toFixed`,
  `String(number)`, and typed-array `.set`. The global is likely the
  number-formatting helper's lookup table or a typed-array template global.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] All probes in #1662 marked "INVALID WASM" compile to **valid**,
      instantiable modules under `--target wasi` and `--target standalone`
      (given the host imports they still legitimately need per #1335/#1470/
      #1664/#1665 — validity is independent of leak-elimination).
- [ ] `String(42)`, `(3.14159).toFixed(2)`, `(255).toString(16)`,
      `` `val=${x}` ``, `new B(5).get()`, `[1,2,3].map(x=>x*2)`,
      `new Uint8Array(4).set([1,2,3])` each instantiate and return correct
      values standalone.
- [ ] Add an import-section + `WebAssembly.compile` validity assertion to
      the standalone test harness so a future regression is caught (extend
      `assert-no-js-host-imports` to also assert the module validates).
- [ ] equivalence tests green in both modes.

## Note

This bug likely **masks** part of the residual-leak analysis in #1664 — fix
this first; some leaks may resolve once the native lowering path is
exercised correctly.
