# #490 — Function/class .name property (576 tests)

## Status: open

576 tests skipped because they access `.name` on functions or classes.

## Approach

Function and class names are statically known at compile time. Store the name as a string field on the function/class struct:

```
struct Function {
  field $__call (ref $functype)
  field $__name (ref string)    // ← add this
}
```

### Implementation
1. Add `__name` field to function and class struct types
2. When compiling function declarations/expressions, set `__name` to the function's identifier (or `""` for anonymous)
3. When compiling class declarations/expressions, set `__name` to the class name
4. Property access `fn.name` resolves to `struct.get $__name`
5. Arrow functions: name is inferred from assignment target (`const foo = () => {}` → name is "foo")
6. Method definitions: name is the method name

Most of the 576 tests just check that `.name` returns the right string — this is compile-time information.

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `function foo() {} foo.name === "foo"` works
- [ ] `class Bar {} Bar.name === "Bar"` works
- [ ] `const fn = function() {}; fn.name === "fn"` works
- [ ] `const obj = { method() {} }; obj.method.name === "method"` works
- [ ] Unlock 400+ tests
