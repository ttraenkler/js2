# Self-referencing struct types for linked lists / fiber trees

## Problem

Classes with fields that reference the same class type (e.g., linked list nodes, tree nodes, React fiber trees) produce incorrect Wasm types. The field types resolve to `externref` instead of `ref null $structTypeIdx` because the struct is not yet registered in `structMap` when field types are resolved during `collectClassDeclaration`.

Example:
```typescript
class TreeNode {
  value: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

The `left` and `right` fields should be `ref null $TreeNode` but were falling back to `externref`, causing type mismatches at runtime.

## Solution

Pre-register the struct type index in `structMap` BEFORE resolving field types in `collectClassDeclaration`. A placeholder struct definition (with empty fields) is pushed to `ctx.mod.types` and the class name is added to `ctx.structMap`. After field types are resolved (which can now find the class in structMap for self-referencing fields), the placeholder is updated in-place with the real fields.

WasmGC natively supports recursive types via rec groups, so no special encoding is needed beyond ensuring the type index is available during field resolution.
