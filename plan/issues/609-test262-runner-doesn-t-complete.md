# #609 — Test262 runner doesn't complete all 53,010 tests (13,323 missing)

## Status: open

The full test262 run only processed 39,687/53,010 tests (74.9%). 13,323 tests never ran.

### Missing categories (43 directories, 8,583 tests)

Zero results from:
- **TypedArray** (2,174) — built-ins/TypedArray, TypedArrayConstructors, Uint8Array
- **annexB** (1,086) — annexB/built-ins, annexB/language
- **intl402** (3,345) — all Intl categories
- **staging** (1,481) — staging/sm, explicit-resource-management, etc.
- **WeakMap/WeakSet/WeakRef** (255)
- **URI functions** (173) — decodeURI, encodeURI, etc.
- **Other** (69) — ThrowTypeError, eval, global, undefined

Plus ~4,740 tests in categories that partially ran.

### Root causes

1. **Worktree runner OOM/timeout**: The --in-worktree re-exec crashes before finishing
2. **Category ordering**: Large categories processed last, runner dies before reaching them
3. **Some dirs missing from TEST_CATEGORIES**

### Fix

1. Add missing directories to TEST_CATEGORIES
2. Add --no-worktree flag for stable source
3. Process smaller categories first
4. Add checkpoint/resume within a single run

## Complexity: M
