# #834 -- ES2025 Set prototype methods (216 tests)

## Problem

216 test262 tests fail with "Missing import for method: Set_union" etc. The ES2025 spec added 7 new Set prototype methods that our compiler doesn't register as host imports:

- `Set.prototype.union()`
- `Set.prototype.intersection()`
- `Set.prototype.difference()`
- `Set.prototype.symmetricDifference()`
- `Set.prototype.isSubsetOf()`
- `Set.prototype.isSupersetOf()`
- `Set.prototype.isDisjointFrom()`

Currently skipped with reason "ES2025: Set methods".

## Fix

Register these as extern class method imports for Set in `src/codegen/index.ts` (same pattern as existing Set methods like `add`, `has`, `delete`). The JS runtime already supports them — just need the import wiring.

Each method takes `(self: Set, other: SetLike) → Set|boolean`:
- union/intersection/difference/symmetricDifference → returns new Set
- isSubsetOf/isSupersetOf/isDisjointFrom → returns boolean

## Acceptance criteria

- 7 Set methods compiled as host imports
- 216 tests unskipped and running
- Remove skip filter for set-methods feature

## Test Results

3/3 issue-specific tests pass:
- Compiles Set.union without errors (generates Set_union import)
- Compiles all 7 ES2025 Set methods (union, intersection, difference, symmetricDifference, isSubsetOf, isSupersetOf, isDisjointFrom)
- Compiles existing Set methods (has, add, delete) via same mechanism

Equivalence tests: 68 failures (same as main baseline, 0 regressions).

## Implementation Summary

Three-part fix:

1. **`src/codegen/index.ts`** (cherry-picked): `registerBuiltinExternClasses()` programmatically registers Set/Map/WeakMap/WeakSet as extern classes with all their methods including 7 new ES2025 Set methods. Called after lib file scanning as a fallback.

2. **`src/codegen/expressions.ts`**: `tryExternClassMethodOnAny()` dispatches method calls on `any`-typed receivers through registered extern classes. Needed because when lib .d.ts files fail to load (ESM/bundled contexts), Set/Map types resolve as `any` and the typed extern class path is skipped. Lazily registers host imports.

3. **`tests/test262-runner.ts`**: Removed `set-methods` feature skip filter, unskipping 216 tests.

Also added `lib.es2024.collection.d.ts` and `lib.esnext.collection.d.ts` to the lib file list (cherry-picked) for environments where lib loading works.
