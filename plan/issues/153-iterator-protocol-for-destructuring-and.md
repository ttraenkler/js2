# #153 -- Iterator protocol for destructuring and for-of

## Status: in-review
## Problem
The `savedBody` swap pattern (used throughout the codegen for compiling inner blocks like loop bodies, if/else branches, etc.) caused stale function indices when late imports (especially `addUnionImports`) shifted function indices. The outer saved body was not reachable by the shifting code, leading to Wasm validation failures like "not enough arguments on the stack for call".

## Fix
Two-pronged approach:

1. **Eager union imports**: Call `addUnionImports(ctx)` unconditionally at the start of module compilation (before any function indices are assigned), eliminating the most common source of late index shifting.

2. **savedBodies stack**: Add a `savedBodies: Instr[][]` field to `FunctionContext` and helper functions `pushBody()`/`popBody()`. All savedBody swap sites push/pop onto this stack. Both `addUnionImports` and the late import shifting code (`shiftLateImportIndices`) now also shift indices in all savedBodies entries.

3. **Additional diagnostic codes**: Added iterator-related TS diagnostic codes (2489, 2763, 2764, 2765) to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` to prevent compile errors from iterator type checks in allowJs mode.

## Complexity: M

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added `savedBodies: Instr[][]` field to `FunctionContext` interface
- Created `pushBody(fctx)` and `popBody(fctx, saved)` helper functions for safe body swapping
- Updated ~30 savedBody swap sites across `statements.ts`, `expressions.ts`, and `index.ts` to use pushBody/popBody
- Updated `addUnionImports` to shift function indices in `fctx.savedBodies` (with double-shift prevention)
- Created `shiftLateImportIndices` helper in `expressions.ts` for `__extern_get`/`__extern_set` late imports
- Replaced 6 inline late import shifting blocks with the shared helper (also adds savedBodies shifting and recursive instruction traversal)
- Changed `generateModule()` to eagerly call `addUnionImports(ctx)` before function compilation
- Added iterator diagnostic codes 2489, 2763, 2764, 2765 to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES`

### What worked
- The eager `addUnionImports` call eliminates the most common index shifting scenario
- The savedBodies stack provides a safety net for any remaining or future late imports
- The `shiftLateImportIndices` helper improves the late import shifting to recurse into nested blocks (body/then/else) which the old inline code did not do

### What didn't work
- N/A -- both approaches were implemented for defense in depth

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- FunctionContext interface, pushBody/popBody helpers, addUnionImports savedBodies shifting, eager addUnionImports call
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- shiftLateImportIndices helper, all savedBody swap sites, all late import sites
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- all savedBody swap sites updated to pushBody/popBody
- `src/compiler.ts` -- additional iterator diagnostic codes

### Tests
- All 541 equivalence tests pass (7 pre-existing failures unrelated to this change)
- Generator for-of loop that previously caused "not enough arguments on the stack for call" now compiles and validates correctly
