# #635 — Add missing Instr opcodes to IR types (158 unsafe casts)

## Status: in-review
158 occurrences of `as unknown as Instr` across the codegen because opcodes like ref.null.extern, ref.null.eq, ref.null.func, ref.cast_null, f64.copysign, f64.min, f64.max are missing from the Instr union in `src/ir/types.ts`.

### Fix
Add all missing opcodes to InstrBase. Purely additive, zero risk. Then remove the unsafe casts.

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added 6 missing opcodes to InstrBase union in `src/ir/types.ts`: `ref.null.eq`, `ref.null.func`, `ref.cast_null`, `f64.copysign`, `f64.min`, `f64.max`
- Added `ref.null.func` emitter support to both `src/emit/binary.ts` and `src/emit/wat.ts`
- Removed all 180 `as unknown as Instr` unsafe casts across codegen files
- Fixed 6 latent bugs uncovered by removing the casts:
  - `{ kind: "unreachable" }` should be `{ op: "unreachable" }` (expressions.ts)
  - `{ op: "ref.null", type: "extern" }` should be `{ op: "ref.null.extern" }` (expressions.ts, 2 places)
  - `{ op: "ref.null", typeIdx: "extern" }` should be `{ op: "ref.null.extern" }` (statements.ts, 3 places)
  - `{ op: "ref.cast", ..., nullable: true }` should be `{ op: "ref.cast_null", ... }` (expressions.ts)
  - `{ op: "br_if", labelIdx: 1 }` should be `{ op: "br_if", depth: 1 }` (index.ts)
  - `{ op: "br", labelIdx: 0 }` should be `{ op: "br", depth: 0 }` (index.ts)
  - Missing `exported: false` on 3 WasmFunction objects (index.ts)

### What worked
- The unsafe casts were hiding real bugs -- wrong property names that would have caused silent runtime failures
- All ops except 6 were already in the union; the casts were simply never cleaned up

### Files changed
- `src/ir/types.ts` -- added 6 opcodes to InstrBase
- `src/emit/binary.ts` -- added ref.null.func emitter
- `src/emit/wat.ts` -- added ref.null.func emitter
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- removed 85 unsafe casts, fixed 4 latent bugs
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- removed 5 unsafe casts, fixed 3 ref.null.extern usages
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- removed 57 unsafe casts, fixed br/br_if depth, added exported field
- `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` -- removed 27 unsafe casts
- `src/codegen/math-helpers.ts` -- removed 1 unsafe cast
