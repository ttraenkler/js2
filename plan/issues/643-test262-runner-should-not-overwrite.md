# #643 — Test262 runner should not overwrite report until run completes

## Status: open

The runner overwrites test262-report.json and test262-results.jsonl at the start of a new run. If the run crashes or is in progress, the report shows incomplete/wrong data. The previous run's results are lost.

### Fix
Write to a temp file during the run, then atomically rename to the final path only when the run completes successfully. Keep the previous report intact until then.

## Complexity: S
