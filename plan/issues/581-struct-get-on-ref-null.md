# #581 — struct.get on ref.null in Wasm:test function (177 CE)

## Status: in-review
177 tests fail with `struct.get[0] expected type (ref null N), found ref.null of type externref` in the `test` function. The struct type indices vary (4, 5, 6, 7) indicating different struct types.

### Root cause
The `test` wrapper function (from wrapTest) compiles code that accesses struct fields before the struct variable is initialized. The local holds `ref.null` (untyped) instead of `ref null $StructType`. This happens when:
1. A class is declared but not yet instantiated
2. The test accesses `.prototype` or static properties on the class name
3. The class name resolves to `ref.null` (no instance exists yet)

### Wasm error locations
- `Wasm:test struct.get[0] expected type (ref null 6)` — 67 occurrences
- `Wasm:test struct.get[0] expected type (ref null 4)` — 44 occurrences
- `Wasm:test struct.get[0] expected type (ref null 5)` — 35 occurrences
- `Wasm:test struct.get[0] expected type (ref null 7)` — 31 occurrences

### Fix
Before struct.get in the `test` function context, emit `ref.cast_null $StructType` to cast the untyped null to the correct struct type. Or ensure class name locals are typed as `ref null $ClassStruct` from the start.

## Complexity: M

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added `emitExternrefToStructGet()` helper in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` that safely casts an externref value on the Wasm stack to a typed struct reference before performing `struct.get`. The helper:
1. Emits `any.convert_extern` to convert externref to anyref
2. Uses `ref.test` + `if/else` to null-safely cast to the target struct type
3. Falls back to a default value (0, ref.null, etc.) when the cast fails (null or wrong type)

Applied this helper in two locations within `compilePropertyAccess()`:
1. The main struct field access path (line ~15150)
2. The dynamic field auto-registration path (line ~15200)

Both previously only handled `ref_null` (via `emitNullGuardedStructGet`) and `ref` (direct struct.get), but not `externref` -- causing Wasm validation to fail when `compileExpression` returned `externref` for the object but the code tried to use `struct.get` with a specific struct type index.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- added `emitExternrefToStructGet()`, updated two `struct.get` sites
- `tests/struct-get-externref-cast.test.ts` -- 5 new tests covering class property access patterns

### Tests
All 75 class/struct-related tests pass, no regressions in existing test suite.
