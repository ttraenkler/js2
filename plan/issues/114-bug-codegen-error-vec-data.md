# Issue 114: Bug — "Codegen error: vec data field not ref"

## Summary

When an array (vec struct) is involved in a computed-property-name or template
literal expression, codegen crashes with:

```
Codegen error: vec data field not ref
```

This causes ~5 test failures across `language/expressions/template-literal` and
`language/computed-property-names`.

## Example tests

- `test/language/expressions/template-literal/literal-expr-member-expr.js`
  — interpolates a member expression into a template literal
- `test/language/computed-property-names/object/accessor/getter-super.js`
  — computed property on an object with numeric-keyed index type

## Root cause

The error message originates from a guard that checks the `data` field of a vec
(array) struct is a `ref` type. When the array element type is mapped to a
non-ref wasm type (e.g., `i32` or `f64`) but the lookup path expected a ref
type (perhaps from a union or `string | number` element type), the check fails
and throws instead of handling the primitive element case.

This is related to the fast-mode element type changes made in #72.

## Approach

1. Find `vec data field not ref` in the codegen source
2. Understand the call path: what triggers this guard?
3. If element type is a primitive (`i32`, `f64`): use the appropriate packed-array
   access (`array.get_s`, `array.get_u`) rather than `array.get`
4. Add a test case: `[1, 2, 3][0]` in a template literal context
