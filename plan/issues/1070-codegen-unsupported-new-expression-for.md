# #1070 — Unsupported `new Intl.ListFormat` (and other Intl constructors)

## Problem

Compiling `node_modules/prettier/doc.mjs` emits:

```
Unsupported new expression for class: ListFormat
Unsupported new expression for class: ListFormat
```

Prettier uses `new Intl.ListFormat(locale, { type: 'conjunction', ... })`
inside its error-message builder to render lists of invalid options
("'tabWidth', 'useTabs', or 'printWidth'"). This is a soft path — only
reached on configuration errors — but it is a real blocker because
codegen emits a `ref.null` placeholder that still participates in later
type checks.

## Context

ts2wasm currently lacks codegen for any `Intl.*` constructor. The host-mode
runtime has a few Intl-adjacent string ops but no class construction path.

This is a pattern that will repeat across any stress test that does error
reporting — lodash, axios, react all use Intl.ListFormat or Intl.NumberFormat
for user-facing messages.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `new Intl.ListFormat(...)` compiles in JS-host mode via a host-import
      construction path (externref return wrapping the native instance)
- [ ] `.format(list)` method call on the returned instance works via
      extern-class dispatch through `runtime.ts`
- [ ] Standalone mode rejects with a clear "Intl.ListFormat requires JS host"
      diagnostic rather than the current "Unsupported new expression"
- [ ] At least `Intl.ListFormat` specifically unblocks; `NumberFormat` and
      `Collator` can be filed as siblings

## Notes

- Surfaced by #1034 prettier stress run, 2026-04-11
- Report: `plan/log/issues/1034-report.md`
- Pattern matches #679/#682 dual-backend: JS host fast path + standalone
  fallback/reject
- Minimal fix: add `ListFormat` to the extern-class table in
  `src/codegen/extern-class.ts` and register a host-import constructor
