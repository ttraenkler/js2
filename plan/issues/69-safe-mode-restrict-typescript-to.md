# Issue 69: Safe mode — restrict TypeScript to a secure subset

## Status: done

## Summary

Add a `{ safe: true }` compiler option that restricts the TypeScript input to a
hardened subset. In safe mode, constructs that could bypass the closed-import
security model (#67) are compile-time errors. The goal: if a module compiles in
safe mode, the host can trust it has a bounded, auditable capability surface —
even if the TypeScript source is untrusted.

## Motivation

After #67 closes the runtime import surface, the remaining attack vectors are
at the language level:

- A malicious author declares `extern class Object` with `__proto__` as a
  property, and our compiler dutifully generates an import for it
- Code uses `declare const window: any` to request a global that leaks
  capabilities
- Dynamic property access (`obj[expr]`) on externrefs compiles to
  `__extern_get`, which is an open property accessor

Safe mode makes these a **compile-time error** rather than a runtime concern.

## What safe mode restricts

### 1. No `any` or `unknown` types on host boundaries

```typescript
// ERROR in safe mode:
declare const window: any;

// OK:
declare class Element {
  textContent: string;
}
```

The type `any` on declared globals or extern class members is rejected — it
would allow the host to pass unconstrained references.

### 2. Extern class member allowlist

The compiler checks extern class declarations against a configurable allowlist:

```typescript
// Compiler option:
{ safe: true, allowedExternMembers: {
    "Element": ["textContent", "appendChild", "querySelector"],
    "Document": ["createElement", "querySelector"],
}}

// ERROR — "innerHTML" not in allowlist:
declare class Element {
  innerHTML: string;  // blocked
}
```

If no allowlist is provided, a sensible default blocks dangerous members like
`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`, `valueOf`, `toString` (on extern
classes), `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`.

### 3. No `declare const` globals (unless allowlisted)

```typescript
// ERROR in safe mode:
declare const document: Document;
declare const window: Window;

// OK if explicitly allowed:
// { safe: true, allowedGlobals: ["document"] }
declare const document: Document;
```

This prevents untrusted code from requesting ambient capabilities. The host
decides which globals to provide.

### 4. No dynamic property access on externrefs

```typescript
declare class Collection { length: number; }

// ERROR in safe mode:
function get(c: Collection, i: number) { return c[i]; }

// OK — use a declared method instead:
declare class Collection {
  length: number;
  item(index: number): Element;
}
```

`__extern_get` is never emitted in safe mode. All externref access must go
through declared methods/properties.

### 5. No code-generation patterns

If we ever add `Function()` constructor support, safe mode blocks it.
(Currently not applicable since wasm can't generate code at runtime, but
future-proofing.)

## Compiler option

```typescript
compile(source, {
  safe: true,
  // Optional refinements:
  allowedGlobals: ["document"],
  allowedExternMembers: {
    "Element": ["textContent", "appendChild", "remove"],
    "Document": ["createElement", "querySelector"],
  },
});
```

When `safe: true`, violations are reported as `CompileError[]` with
severity `"error"`.

## What safe mode does NOT restrict

- Regular TypeScript code (arithmetic, control flow, classes, generics, etc.)
- String operations (these go through `wasm:js-string`, which is a fixed API)
- Math functions (safe — they're pure functions)
- console.log (safe — output only)
- Array methods (safe — operate on wasm GC arrays)

## Relationship to other issues

- **#67 (closed imports)**: Safe mode is the compile-time complement to #67's
  runtime fix. Together they form defense in depth: #67 ensures only declared
  imports exist at runtime, #69 ensures the declarations themselves are safe.
- **#68 (DOM containment)**: Orthogonal. DOM containment scopes *where* a module
  can operate; safe mode scopes *what* it can request.
- **#66 (security design doc)**: Safe mode is a natural extension of the
  security analysis.

## Implementation sketch

Add a validation pass after type-checking but before codegen:

```typescript
function validateSafeMode(ast: ts.SourceFile, checker: ts.TypeChecker, options: SafeOptions): CompileError[] {
  const errors: CompileError[] = [];
  // Walk all declarations, check extern classes, declared globals, etc.
  return errors;
}
```

This is a pure analysis pass — it doesn't change codegen at all. It just
rejects programs that would produce unsafe import manifests.

## Tests

- Compile with `safe: true`, verify clean code passes
- Verify `declare const window: any` is rejected
- Verify extern class with `__proto__` property is rejected
- Verify dynamic externref access is rejected
- Verify allowlisted globals/members pass
- Verify non-extern code (pure compute) is unaffected

## Complexity

M — ~250 lines, new validation pass + compiler option plumbing
