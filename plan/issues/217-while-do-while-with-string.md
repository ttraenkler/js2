# #217 -- While/do-while with string/object loop conditions and labeled block break

## Status: in-review
## Summary
While/do-while tests fail where the loop condition involves non-boolean values (strings, objects) that need truthiness coercion, and labeled block break (break from a non-loop labeled block) doesn't work correctly.

## Root Cause
1. **Loop conditions with externref**: `ensureI32Condition` already handles externref via `__is_truthy` import and ref/ref_null via `ref.is_null`. The original test262 failures were from outdated test results -- the core loop condition handling was already correct.

2. **Labeled block break**: `compileLabeledStatement` only recorded the label position for loops. For non-loop labeled blocks (e.g., `label: { while(true) { break label; } unreachable; }`), `break label` would target the inner loop's break depth instead of the outer block, causing code after the loop to still execute.

## Fix
1. Updated `compileLabeledStatement` to detect whether the inner statement is a loop or a block. For non-loop statements, wraps the body in a Wasm `block` instruction and pushes a break entry so `break label` correctly exits the entire labeled block.

2. Fixed false positive in `shouldSkip`'s "runtime in operator" check by stripping the YAML metadata block before pattern matching -- metadata text like `"break" in order` was falsely triggering the skip.

## Files Changed
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- `compileLabeledStatement` handles non-loop labeled blocks
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- fixed false positive in `in` operator skip filter
- `tests/equivalence.test.ts` -- added tests for labeled block break

## Test262 Impact
- while: S12.6.2_A4_T5 now passes (labeled break from while)
- do-while: S12.6.1_A4_T5 now passes (labeled break from do-while)
