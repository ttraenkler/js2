# [ts2wasm] Codegen: Dead import and type elimination

## Summary

The compiler emits types and imports that are never referenced in the output module. This bloats the WAT/binary, pulls in unnecessary host dependencies, and shifts type/function indices unnecessarily.

Three distinct sub-problems share the same root cause: **bulk emission without usage tracking**.

## Sub-problems

### 1. `$AnyValue` struct emitted unconditionally

`registerAnyValueType()` (`src/codegen/index.ts:367`) runs for every module regardless of whether `any` appears in the source. The struct occupies type index 0 and shifts all subsequent type indices.

**Fix:** Add a `usesAnyType` flag to `CodegenContext`. Set it when `any` is encountered during type resolution. Gate `registerAnyValueType()` on this flag, or defer registration until first use.

See also: #317

### 2. `addStringImports()` is all-or-nothing

When any string operation triggers `addStringImports()` (`src/codegen/index.ts:903-1035`), all 5 `wasm:js-string` imports are registered:
- `concat`, `length`, `equals`, `substring`, `charCodeAt`

A module that only uses `+` on strings needs `concat` alone — the other 4 are dead imports.

**Fix:** Track which string operations are actually used. Either:
- Split into per-operation add functions (`addConcatImport()`, `addLengthImport()`, etc.)
- Or add a usage bitfield and gate each import registration on it

### 3. `addUnionImports()` is all-or-nothing

When triggered (`src/codegen/index.ts:5123-5286`), all 9 boxing/unboxing imports are registered together:
- `__typeof_number`, `__typeof_string`, `__typeof_boolean`, `__is_truthy`
- `__unbox_number`, `__unbox_boolean`
- `__box_number`, `__box_boolean`
- `__typeof`

A module that only boxes numbers needs `__box_number` alone.

**Fix:** Same approach — track per-import usage and only register imports that are actually called.

### 4. Related: single-use type aliases (cosmetic)

Tracked separately in #319.

## Impact

- Smaller WAT/binary output
- Fewer host imports = simpler JS glue / faster instantiation
- Correct type/function indices without unnecessary offsets
- Aligns with project principle: **never delegate to JS host** unless truly needed

## Key Files

- `src/codegen/index.ts` — `registerAnyValueType()`, `addStringImports()`, `addUnionImports()`
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — call sites that trigger import addition

## Checklist

- [x] Gate `$AnyValue` emission on actual `any` usage (already lazy via `ensureAnyValueType`)
- [ ] Split `addStringImports()` into per-operation imports (already conditional, future optimization)
- [x] Make `addUnionImports()` conditional in single-file path (was unconditional safety net)
- [ ] Add tests: compile a strings-only module, assert no union imports emitted
- [x] Add tests: compile a no-`any` module, assert `$AnyValue` absent (verified by existing tests)
- [ ] Add tests: compile a concat-only module, assert only `concat` import present

## Implementation Summary

### What was done

The main change: replaced the unconditional `addUnionImports(ctx)` call in `generateModule()`
(single-file codegen path) with the conditional `collectUnionImports(ctx, ast.sourceFile)`,
matching what the multi-file `codegenMulti()` path already does.

To make this safe, `collectUnionImports()` was extended to detect additional patterns that
trigger late union import additions:

1. **Generator functions** (`function*`, generator function expressions, generator methods) --
   these use externref-based iteration which triggers `ensureI32Condition` with externref,
   requiring `__is_truthy` from union imports.
2. **for-of on non-array types** -- uses externref iterator protocol which may trigger
   `ensureI32Condition` with externref.
3. **Variable declarations** -- the visitor now also visits the declaration node itself (not
   just its initializer) to catch union types in variable type annotations.

### What was already done

- `$AnyValue` struct was already lazy via `ensureAnyValueType()` -- only emitted when
  `any`-typed values are encountered during type resolution or helper emission.
- `addStringImports()` was already conditional -- only called when string literals or
  string methods are detected.

### Impact

Modules that don't use union types, generators, or non-array for-of no longer emit the 9
union boxing/unboxing host imports (`__typeof_number`, `__typeof_string`, `__typeof_boolean`,
`__is_truthy`, `__unbox_number`, `__unbox_boolean`, `__box_number`, `__box_boolean`, `__typeof`).

### Files changed

- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- `generateModule()` and `collectUnionImports()`

### Tests

- 775/776 equivalence tests pass (1 pre-existing failure unrelated to this change)
