# #453 — Compile Three.js to Wasm

## Problem
Three.js is a large, performance-sensitive 3D graphics library with heavy use of classes, inheritance, math operations, and typed arrays. Compiling it to Wasm tests ts2wasm's ability to handle real-world OOP patterns and could yield significant performance gains for the math-heavy core (matrix/vector operations).

## Requirements
- Attempt to compile Three.js (`three` npm package) to Wasm via ts2wasm
- Start with the math module (Vector2/3/4, Matrix3/4, Quaternion, Euler) — these are self-contained and performance-critical
- Track compilation progress by module: math, core, renderers, loaders, etc.
- For compiling modules, validate correctness against Three.js unit tests
- Benchmark Wasm math module vs JS math module (matrix multiply, vector transforms)
- Document blocking patterns and file issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- Math module (Vector3, Matrix4, Quaternion) compiles and passes unit tests
- Performance comparison for math operations (Wasm vs JS)
- Report showing compilation coverage by Three.js module
- List of blocking compiler features mapped to issues
