# #1005 -- Benchmark cold-start startup across Wasmtime, Wasm in Node.js, and native JS in Node.js

## Status: open

The project now has browser-facing runtime and loading-speed comparisons, but it
still lacks a clear cold-start benchmark for server-side and CLI-style startup
paths.

For adoption questions like:

- how fast does a precompiled `.wasm` module start in `wasmtime`?
- how does that compare to the same `.wasm` module in Node.js?
- how does both compare to running the equivalent JS directly in Node.js?

we currently do not have one consistent benchmark suite and reporting path.

## Goal

Create a reproducible cold-start benchmark that compares:

1. precompiled Wasm in `wasmtime`
2. precompiled Wasm in Node.js
3. native JS in Node.js

for the same benchmark programs and the same measurement protocol.

## Scope

1. Define one or more startup-oriented benchmark programs
   - small pure compute example
   - moderate host-free real-world example
   - optional larger app-shaped example
2. Measure cold start with cache-resistant methodology
   - process startup
   - module load / instantiate
   - first call to exported entrypoint
3. Separate:
   - module startup cost
   - first execution cost
4. Ensure the Wasm paths use precompiled artifacts, not source compilation
5. Emit machine-readable results for:
   - dashboard/report page use
   - CI regression comparison

## Suggested methodology

- Node.js JS baseline:
  - spawn fresh Node process
  - import/require benchmark module
  - invoke entry once
- Node.js Wasm path:
  - spawn fresh Node process
  - load precompiled `.wasm`
  - instantiate
  - invoke entry once
- Wasmtime path:
  - spawn fresh `wasmtime`
  - run the same precompiled `.wasm`
  - capture startup + first execution timing

Where possible, report:

- process startup overhead
- instantiate/load time
- first-run completion time
- total wall time

## Acceptance criteria

- benchmark script exists and is reproducible from the repo
- compares `wasmtime`, Wasm-in-Node, and JS-in-Node on the same examples
- does not include TS/JS-to-Wasm source compilation in the timed section
- outputs machine-readable JSON results
- methodology is documented so cold vs warm behavior is not conflated

## Notes

This benchmark is intentionally different from the landing-page browser loading
metric:

- landing page: browser incremental module loading
- this issue: fresh-process cold start in server/runtime environments

It should eventually feed reporting that answers startup questions for
standalone Wasm deployment targets, not just browser embedding.

## Test Results

Local cold-start benchmark results (5 runs each, no wasmtime available in container):

| Program | JS-in-Node (median wall) | Wasm-in-Node (median wall) |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| array-sum | 21.4ms | 23.8ms |
| fib-recursive | 30.3ms | 36.2ms |
| fib (loop) | 22.4ms | 19.8ms |
| object-ops | 22.4ms | 21.6ms |
| string-hash | 30.0ms | FAILED (wasm:js-string interop) |

4/5 programs pass both paths. Wasm-in-Node is competitive with JS-in-Node — sometimes faster (fib loop, object-ops), sometimes slightly slower (fib-recursive, array-sum). String-hash fails due to wasm:js-string builtin interop with host string_charAt import — a known limitation of mixing string backends.

## Implementation Notes

- `benchmarks/cold-start/run-cold-start.mjs` — main orchestrator, discovers programs from `benchmarks/competitive/programs/`, compiles to .wasm, spawns fresh child processes
- `benchmarks/cold-start/child-js.mjs` — JS-in-Node child process, measures load + exec phases
- `benchmarks/cold-start/child-wasm-node.mjs` — Wasm-in-Node child, builds minimal imports inline, uses `wasm:js-string` builtins
- `benchmarks/cold-start/README.md` — methodology documentation
- Results output to `benchmarks/results/cold-start-<timestamp>.json`
- Wasmtime path included but gracefully skipped when not installed
