# #696 — Classify "other fail" runtime errors (4,649 FAIL)

## Status: in-review
4,649 tests fail with errors that don't match "returned N" pattern. These are likely Wasm traps (RuntimeError) now propagating after we removed the try/catch wrapper. Need to classify these errors.

### Fix
1. Break down the 4,649 by actual error message
2. Many are probably null pointer deref, illegal cast, OOB that the grep didn't catch
3. Update error reporting to capture full trap messages

## Complexity: S (analysis) + M (fixes)

## Implementation

Added `classifyError()` to `tests/test262-runner.ts` that classifies error messages into 14 categories:
- **null_deref** (497): Wasm trap — dereferencing null pointer
- **illegal_cast** (212): Wasm trap — ref.cast failure
- **oob** (5): Wasm trap — out of bounds access
- **unreachable** (18): Wasm trap — unreachable executed
- **type_error** (10,387): JS TypeError from host/runtime
- **range_error** (11): JS RangeError / stack overflow
- **syntax_error**: JS SyntaxError
- **promise_error** (196): Promise/async failures
- **assertion_fail** (10,158): Test returned non-1 (assert counter)
- **exception_in_test**: Test returned -1 (exception caught)
- **wasm_compile** (774 fail + 512 CE): Wasm validation errors
- **negative_test_fail** (817): Negative tests that should have failed
- **runtime_error** (236): Other Cannot/Invalid errors
- **other** (21): Unclassified

Updated `recordResult()` in `tests/test262-vitest.test.ts` to:
- Compute `error_category` for every fail/compile_error
- Store it in JSONL entries as `error_category` field
- Track aggregate `error_categories` in report.json
- Print category breakdown in afterAll console output
