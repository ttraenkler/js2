# #954 — Eliminate duplicate local declarations

## Source

Discovered by `scripts/analyze-wat-patterns.ts` (#948) — corpus of 3,619 modules from equiv tests.

## Problem

57% of compiled modules (2,064/3,619) have duplicate `(local $name ...)` declarations in their functions. 3,366 extra locals exist across the corpus.

Example from `$test` function:
```wat
(func $test (result f64)
  (local $result f64)   ;; declared in pre-pass
  (local $i f64)
  (local $result f64)   ;; DUPLICATE — re-declared during codegen
  (local $i i32)        ;; same name, different type (narrowed to i32)
```

## Root Cause

The compiler runs a local allocation pre-pass (which assigns f64 slots for all variables), then during codegen, native type inference (`i32` narrowing) allocates **additional** i32 locals for the same variables. This creates duplicate `$name` entries — once with `f64`, once with `i32`.

## Impact

- Binary size: each extra local costs ~5–15 bytes in the Wasm locals section
- At 3,366 extra locals across ~1,100 test modules, average ~3 extra locals per affected module
- In large real-world modules (calendar example: 60+ duplicate locals in `renderCal`)

## Fix

In `src/codegen/index.ts`, the local allocation pass creates locals. When the i32 narrowing pass allocates a new local for the same TS variable, it should **reuse** the existing index instead of creating a new one.

The key lookup is in the `FunctionContext.locals` map. When `allocateI32Local(name)` is called and `name` already exists with an f64 index, reuse that index (update the type) or assign the i32 local to the same slot.

Alternatively: in the WAT emitter, deduplicate locals with the same `$name` — keep the last/narrowest type only.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `scripts/analyze-wat-patterns.ts` reports 0 `total_extra_locals` (or near 0) after fix
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No duplicate `(local $name ...)` declarations in emitted WAT

## Test Plan

Run `npx tsx scripts/analyze-wat-patterns.ts` before and after — `duplicate_locals.total_extra_locals` should drop from 3,366 to ~0.
