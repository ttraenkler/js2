# Issue #278: Cannot destructure -- not a known struct type

## Status: done

## Summary
~44 tests fail with "Cannot destructure: not a known struct type: __object" errors. Destructuring assignment or declaration on values whose type is not a recognized struct fails. The codegen needs to handle destructuring on dynamically-typed values or externref objects.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group D

## Complexity: M

## Scope
- Support destructuring on externref/unknown-typed values via property access fallback
- Handle object destructuring where the source type is inferred as a generic object
- Support destructuring in catch clauses and for-of iterations
- Update destructuring compilation in `src/codegen/statements.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Destructuring on dynamically-typed values compiles
- At least 25 compile errors resolved

## Implementation notes
- Root cause: `compileObjectDestructuring` in `statements.ts` did not call `ensureStructForType` for anonymous object types (symbol name `__type` or `__object`). The expression-level destructuring in `expressions.ts` already had this auto-registration logic.
- Fix: Added `ensureStructForType` import and auto-registration block in `compileObjectDestructuring` (mirroring the pattern from `expressions.ts` line ~2950).
- When a function returns `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`, TypeScript gives the return type a symbol name of `__type` or `__object`. The fix detects this and calls `ensureStructForType` to register the anonymous struct before looking it up in `ctx.structMap`.
