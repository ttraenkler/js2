# #433 — Equality operators with mixed types produce i32/f64 type mismatch (10 CE)

## Problem

10 tests fail with Wasm validation errors when equality operators encounter mixed types involving objects with `valueOf`/`toString` methods:

### Error patterns

1. `i32.eq[1] expected type i32, found if of type f64` (2 CE)
2. `i32.ne[1] expected type i32, found if of type f64` (3 CE)
3. `local.set[0] expected type f64, found i32.const` (3 CE)
4. `call[0] expected type externref, found i32.const` (2 CE)

### Sample failing tests

- `test/language/expressions/equals/S11.9.1_A7.8.js` -- `true == {valueOf: ...}` with mixed primitive/object types
- `test/language/expressions/equals/S11.9.1_A7.9.js` -- `1 == {valueOf: ...}` comparing number to object
- `test/language/expressions/does-not-equals/S11.9.2_A3.2.js` -- `null != {valueOf: ...}`
- `test/language/expressions/strict-equals/S11.9.4_A8_T1.js` -- strict equality with mixed types
- `test/language/expressions/strict-does-not-equals/S11.9.5_A8_T1.js` -- strict inequality with mixed types

### Sample test pattern

```javascript
if ((true == {valueOf: function() {return 1}}) !== true) {
  throw new Test262Error('...');
}
```

## Root cause

The equality codegen path sometimes emits `i32.eq`/`i32.ne` (expecting i32 boolean result) but one operand is a conditional expression that returns f64 (the result of valueOf coercion). The compiler does not insert `i32.trunc_f64_s` or similar coercion before the comparison.

Similarly, when a boolean (`true`/`false` as i32) needs to be compared to an externref (object), the compiler does not properly coerce the i32 to externref via boxing.

## Priority: medium (10 tests)

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `true == {valueOf: () => 1}` compiles and returns `true`
- [x] `null != {valueOf: () => 0}` compiles correctly
- [x] Strict equality with mixed types compiles correctly
- [x] Reduce equality-related type mismatch CEs to zero

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Three fixes in `compileBinaryExpression` and `coerceType` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`:

1. **Strict equality with mixed ref/primitive types**: When one operand is a struct ref (object) and the other is a primitive (boolean, number), strict `===`/`!==` now correctly returns `false`/`true` immediately (different JS types are never strictly equal). Previously, only the case where both sides were refs was handled.

2. **i32/f64 promotion after valueOf coercion**: After coercing a struct ref to f64 via valueOf, the other operand may still be i32 (e.g., boolean `true`). Added promotion of i32 to f64 after the valueOf coercion block. Also fixed the local type used when saving the right operand during left-side coercion -- it must match the actual right operand type, not always be f64.

3. **valueOf fallback to standalone function**: When `coerceType` converts a struct ref to f64, it looks for a valueOf closure stored in the struct's eqref field. For method shorthand syntax (`{ valueOf() { ... } }`), the method is compiled as a standalone function (`ClassName_valueOf`) but NOT stored as a closure in the struct field. Added a fallback to check for `${name}_valueOf` in `ctx.funcMap` when no tracked closure types are found.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- three fixes in `compileBinaryExpression` (struct ref valueOf coercion block) and `coerceType` (ref-to-f64 eqref path)
- `tests/equivalence/equality-mixed-types.test.ts` -- 8 new equivalence tests

### Tests now passing
All 8 new equivalence tests pass. No regressions in existing test suite.
