# #522 — Object.keys() requires struct type argument (43 CE)

## Status: in-progress

43 tests fail because `Object.keys(obj)` rejects non-struct arguments. The type check is too strict — it should accept `any`/`externref` typed objects and fall back to runtime enumeration or return empty array.

## Complexity: XS
