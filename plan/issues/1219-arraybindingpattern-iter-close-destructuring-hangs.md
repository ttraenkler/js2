# #1219 — ArrayBindingPattern iter-close: hang when iterator never sets done:true

## Problem

26 test262 tests in the `ary-init-iter-close` cluster produce genuine runtime hangs
(~22-28s exec time, then 30s timeout kill). Representative test:
`test/language/destructuring/binding/syntax/meth-ary-init-iter-close.js`

Measured: compileMs=363, execMs=22389 — this is a **runtime** hang, not a compile hang.
`compile_timeout` is a misnomer; the 30s timer covers combined compile+execute.

## Root cause

`ArrayBindingPattern` lowering emits `iter.next()` in a loop that continues until
`result.done === true`. When the iterator never sets `done: true` (spec-compliant
iterators that yield infinitely), the loop runs forever.

Per **ECMA-262 §13.3.3.5 step 4**: destructuring should pull at most
`pattern.elements.length` items from the iterator, then call `IteratorClose`
unconditionally — regardless of the `done` flag.

## Fix

In `src/codegen/expressions.ts` (or `statements.ts`) — wherever `ArrayBindingPattern`
is lowered:

1. Bound the `iter.next()` call loop by `pattern.elements.length` (exact count of
   binding elements), not by `done: true`
2. After all N bindings are extracted, emit an unconditional `IteratorClose` call
   (`iter.return()`)
3. Rest elements (`...rest`) are a special case — they consume until `done: true`,
   but must still call `IteratorClose` on completion

Spec reference: ECMA-262 §13.3.3.5 steps 4-8, and §7.4.6 (IteratorClose).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] All 26 `ary-init-iter-close` tests pass (currently compile_timeout → should be pass or fail, not hang)
- [ ] Regression test `tests/issue-1219.test.ts` covers: finite iterator destructuring, iterator-never-done destructuring (should not hang), rest element destructuring
- [ ] No regression on existing destructuring equivalence tests
- [ ] `compile_timeout` count in test262 drops by ≥20 (allowing for some remaining load flakes)

## Wall-clock impact

26 tests × 30s / 9 forks = **~87s wall-clock saved per test262 run**.

## Probe scripts

`.tmp/probe-wrapped.mjs` and `.tmp/probe-timeout.mjs` left by senior-timeouts for reproduction.

## Notes

The ~70 other "compile_timeout" tests are load-induced flakes — they run in <3s in
isolation. Do NOT try to fix those here; they belong to the runner-tuning work (#1217).
Phase 3 of #1207 (drop timeout 30s→10s) should wait until this lands, then reassess.
