# #798 -- try/catch JS exception interop (~3,000 tests)

## Problem

Wasm exceptions thrown via `throw $tag` are catchable, but **JS exceptions thrown by host imports** (TypeError from built-in methods, Error from user code) propagate as `WebAssembly.Exception` and bypass Wasm `catch` blocks. This means try/catch in compiled code can't catch errors from host calls.

## Architecture

### How Wasm exception handling works now
```wasm
try
  call $some_function  ;; if this throws via `throw $tag`, caught below
catch $tag
  ;; gets the externref payload
end
```

This works for our own throws. But when a host import throws a JS Error, it becomes a `WebAssembly.Exception` that doesn't match `$tag`.

### Fix: catch_all for foreign exceptions

```wasm
try
  call $host_import  ;; might throw JS TypeError
catch $tag
  ;; our own exceptions — extract payload
catch_all
  ;; foreign JS exceptions land here
  ;; need to extract the original Error object
  ;; re-wrap as externref for the catch variable
end
```

### Implementation

**Phase 1: catch_all emission**
- In try/catch compilation, always emit `catch_all` after `catch $tag`
- In `catch_all`: the JS exception is on the extern stack — use `extern.internalize` or a host import `__get_exception` to retrieve the Error object as externref
- Store as the catch variable

**Phase 2: Exception type checking**
- `catch (e) { if (e instanceof TypeError) ... }` needs to work
- The externref from catch_all needs instanceof support (already partially implemented via host)

**Phase 3: throw/rethrow**
- `throw e` in catch block: if e is externref (foreign exception), use `throw $tag` with the externref as payload
- `rethrow`: re-throw the caught exception

### Standalone mode
`catch_all` is a Wasm spec instruction — no host imports needed for the basic mechanism. The `__get_exception` helper is needed to extract the Error object in JS host mode; in standalone mode, foreign exceptions can be represented as opaque externrefs.

## Files to modify
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — compileTryStatement (add catch_all)
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — compileThrowExpression
- `src/emit/binary.ts` — encode catch_all instruction
- `src/ir/types.ts` — add catch_all to instruction types if missing

## Acceptance criteria
- try/catch catches both Wasm and JS exceptions
- catch variable holds the Error object
- instanceof works on caught exceptions
- 3,000+ test262 improvements
