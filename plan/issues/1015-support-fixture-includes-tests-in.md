# #1015 — Support fixture/includes tests in unified compilation mode (172 CE)

## Problem

172 test262 tests fail with `fixture tests not supported in unified mode`. These tests use the `includes:` metadata to load helper files (e.g. `propertyHelper.js`, `compareArray.js`) that define shared assertion utilities.

The test262 runner currently skips these in unified compilation mode because the compiler doesn't handle multi-file includes.

## Approach

The test262 harness already has preamble injection for `assert.js` and `sta.js`. Extend it to also inject the `includes:` files listed in test metadata. The includes are standard test262 harness files in `test262/harness/`.
