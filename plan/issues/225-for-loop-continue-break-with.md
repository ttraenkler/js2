# Issue #225: For-loop continue/break with string !== comparison

## Status: done

## Summary

15 for-loop tests fail because string inequality comparison (`!==`) on the loop result string does not work correctly. Tests like `S12.6.3_A11_T1.js` build a string via `__str += index` inside a loop with `continue`/`break`, then check the result with `if (__str !== "56789")`. The string comparison returns wrong results, causing the test to throw.

## Root Cause

The `!==` operator on strings likely falls back to reference comparison instead of value comparison. When the test uses `__str !== "56789"`, the runtime compares struct refs rather than string content, so the check always fails (or always passes incorrectly), causing the throw branch to execute.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- `!==` operator string dispatch
- Tests affected: 15 in `language/statements/for`

## Expected Impact

Fixes 15 runtime failures.

## Suggested Approach

1. In the `!==` codegen path, detect when both operands are string type (or one is a string literal)
2. Emit `__str_equals` import call followed by `i32.eqz` (negate) instead of `ref.eq`
3. Similar to how `===` was fixed for strings -- extend the same pattern to `!==`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `!==` on string values uses content comparison, not reference comparison
- [ ] All 15 for-loop continue/break tests pass
- [ ] No regression in existing string equality tests

## Implementation Notes

The root cause was in `compileBinaryExpression` in `expressions.ts`. When one operand is `any`-typed
(e.g. `var __str` without type annotation) and the other is a string literal, both compile to
`externref` in non-fast mode. The externref equality path at line ~1946 was unconditionally unboxing
to f64 for numeric comparison, which converts strings to NaN and breaks the comparison.

Fix: Before the numeric unboxing path, check if either operand's TS type is a string type
(`isStringType`). If so, call `addStringImports` to ensure the `equals` function is available
and use it for content comparison instead of numeric unboxing. For `!==`, negate with `i32.eqz`.

## Complexity: S
