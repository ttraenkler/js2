# #537 — TypeScript diagnostic suppressions for test262 (62 CE)

## Status: in-review
62 tests fail due to TypeScript diagnostics that should be suppressed in test262/allowJs mode:

| Pattern | Count |
|---------|------:|
| "Modifiers cannot appear here" | 15 |
| "Expression expected" | 11 |
| "This expression is not constructable" | 10 |
| "'super' can only be referenced in derived class" | 9 |
| "No base constructor has specified type args" | 9 |
| "'await' is reserved at top-level of module" | 6 |
| "Duplicate function implementation" | 6 |

These are valid JS patterns that TypeScript's strict checker rejects. Add the diagnostic codes to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` in `compiler.ts`.

## Complexity: XS

## Implementation Summary

Added 9 diagnostic codes to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` in `src/compiler.ts`:
- 1184 — "Modifiers cannot appear here"
- 1109 — "Expression expected"
- 1135 — "Argument expression expected"
- 2351 — "This expression is not constructable"
- 2335 — "'super' can only be referenced in a derived class"
- 2660 — "'super' can only be referenced in members of derived classes or object literal expressions"
- 2508 — "No base constructor has the specified number of type arguments"
- 1262 — "Identifier expected. 'X' is a reserved word at the top-level of a module" (covers "'await' is reserved" pattern)
- 2393 — "Duplicate function implementation"

Also added the syntactic codes (1184, 1109, 1135, 1262) to both `TOLERATED_SYNTAX_CODES` sets, since these diagnostics can appear as syntactic parse errors that would block compilation even when downgraded in the semantic phase.
