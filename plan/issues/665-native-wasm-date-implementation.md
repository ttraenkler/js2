# Issue #665: Native Wasm Date implementation

## Problem
Date constructor and methods are not supported. `new Date(ms)`, `new Date()`, `Date.now()`,
and `.getTime()` all fail or produce incorrect results.

## Solution
Represent Date as a WasmGC struct with a single f64 timestamp field (ms since epoch).

## Implementation summary
Native Date via WasmGC struct with f64 timestamp. Civil date algorithm for year/month/day decomposition. Host import `__date_now` for current time.
