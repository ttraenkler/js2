# #509 -- Post-fix error analysis: create issues from fresh test262 run

## Status: in-review
## Fresh baseline (2026-03-18, 23,021 tests)

| Metric | Count | % of total |
|--------|------:|----------:|
| Pass | 6,366 | 27.7% |
| Fail | 4,367 | 19.0% |
| Compile error | 9,062 | 39.4% |
| Skip | 3,226 | 14.0% |

### Compile error buckets (9,062 total)

| Bucket | Count | % of CE | Issue |
|--------|------:|--------:|-------|
| Unsupported call expression | 3,931 | 43% | #409 (review) |
| struct.new stack args | 975 | 10% | #411 |
| options is not defined | 684 | 7% | **#514 (NEW)** |
| local.set type mismatch (struct.new) | 483 | 5% | #444 |
| call type mismatch (ref.null) | 403 | 4% | **#511 (updated)** |
| uninitialized non-defaultable local | 202 | 2% | **#515 (NEW)** |
| struct.get/set type mismatch | ~270 | 3% | **#515 (NEW)** |
| call_ref externref mismatch | 111 | 1% | **#511 (updated)** |
| ';' expected | 78 | 1% | **#510 (updated)** |
| Cannot destructure: not array | 83 | 1% | #420 |
| Type annotations | 60 | 1% | **#510 (updated)** |
| targetLocal not defined | 61 | 1% | #405 |
| delete operator | 88 | 1% | #492 |
| Object.keys struct | 67 | 1% | existing |
| stack element count errors | ~59 | 1% | **#515 (NEW)** |
| Other | ~400 | 4% | various |

### Runtime failure buckets (4,367 total)

| Bucket | Count | % of FAIL | Issue |
|--------|------:|----------:|-------|
| returned 0 (wrong value) | 3,436 | 78% | **#513 (updated)** |
| illegal cast | 683 | 15% | **#512 (updated)** |
| null pointer deref | 129 | 3% | #441 |
| timeout (>30s) | 93 | 2% | infra |
| array out of bounds | 14 | <1% | #326 |
| expected ReferenceError but succeeded | 6 | <1% | #443 |
| Other (divide by zero, stack overflow) | 6 | <1% | various |

## Issues created/updated

| Issue | Title | Count | Action |
|-------|-------|------:|--------|
| #510 | TS parse errors from test wrapping | 175 CE | Updated (was 78) |
| #511 | Wasm validation: call/call_ref type mismatch | 514 CE | Updated (was 65) |
| #512 | RuntimeError: illegal cast | 683 FAIL | Updated (was 65) |
| #513 | returned 0: wrong return value | 3,436 FAIL | Updated (was 480) |
| #514 | Generator/async-gen "options is not defined" | 684 CE | **NEW** |
| #515 | Wasm validation: uninitialized local + struct type errors | 470 CE | **NEW** |

## Comparison vs pre-fix baseline

| Metric | Pre-fix estimate | Actual | Delta |
|--------|----------------:|-------:|------:|
| CE | ~2,200 | 9,062 | Much worse than expected |
| FAIL | ~500 | 4,367 | Much worse than expected |
| Pass | ~8,000+ | 6,366 | Lower than expected |

Note: The pre-fix estimates were based on a smaller test set (22,865 tests). The fresh run covers 23,021 tests and uses different test wrapping/harness code, which may account for some of the difference. The "Unsupported call expression" bucket alone (3,931 CE) is larger than the total estimated remaining CEs.

## Priority ranking for next sprint

1. **#409** (Unsupported call expression, 3,931 CE) -- already in review, highest impact
2. **#514** (options is not defined, 684 CE) -- NEW, likely a single root cause fix
3. **#513** (returned 0, 3,436 FAIL) -- needs sub-triage before fixing
4. **#512** (illegal cast, 683 FAIL) -- systematic ref.cast audit needed
5. **#515** (uninitialized local + struct types, 470 CE) -- multiple sub-patterns

## Complexity: S
