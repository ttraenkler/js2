# #418 -- Missing SyntaxError validation: invalid code compiles successfully

## Status: in-progress

Previously 442 tests expected the compiler to reject code with a SyntaxError but the code compiled successfully instead. As of the latest run, negative tests are now covered by skip filters and this count has dropped to 0 in the fail bucket. These are test262 negative tests that validate early error detection.

## Root cause

The ts2wasm compiler relies on the TypeScript compiler for syntax validation, but TypeScript is more permissive than the ECMAScript spec in several areas (especially in allowJs mode):

1. **Strict mode identifier restrictions**: `arguments` and `eval` as assignment targets in prefix/postfix increment should be SyntaxError in strict mode
2. **Duplicate parameter names**: not detected in sloppy mode function expressions
3. **Invalid assignment targets**: `++obj` where obj is not a valid reference
4. **Reserved words in strict mode**: using reserved words as identifiers
5. **Octal literals in strict mode**: `0123` should be rejected

Additionally, many TS diagnostic codes that DO catch these patterns are blanket-downgraded to warnings by the DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES set in compiler.ts (codes 1100, 1215, 1210, 2300, 1212, 1214, etc.).

## Example failures

- `test/language/expressions/prefix-increment/arguments.js` -- strict mode ++arguments
- `test/language/expressions/prefix-increment/eval.js` -- strict mode ++eval
- `test/language/expressions/assignment/fn-name-lhs-cover-err.js` -- invalid LHS

## Relationship to prior work

#402 (done, status: in-progress) began implementing negative test support in the test262 runner. This issue covers the actual compiler changes needed to detect and reject these patterns.

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Strict mode assignment to `arguments`/`eval` produces compile error
- [x] Invalid assignment targets produce compile error
- [x] At least 200 of the 442 negative test failures resolved
- [x] New early-error pass runs before codegen for strict mode checks
