# #6742 — budget-aware wasm-opt level for the standalone lanes

## Problem

The npm-compat standalone lanes always ask Binaryen for `-O4`. Two packages
show why that cannot hold for every module:

- **axios** (`standalone-dynamic`): the raw module is valid (9,260,766 B), but
  `-O4` aborts in Binaryen's Flatten pass on `try_table`, and the #4586 retry
  without Flatten runs past the 600 s wasm-opt timeout. The lane reports
  `optimization-error`, and the retry's own failure is cut off behind
  Binaryen.js's source dump (#6732).
- **lodash-es**: `-O4` is ≈75 % of a 352 s lane (#6737). CI's bounded child
  budget for a host-blocked package is 120 s.

Binaryen's npm `wasm-opt` is a single-threaded Emscripten build, so its cost
tracks the raw module size.

## Measured (2026-09-29, Binaryen 132 npm `wasm-opt`, `/usr/bin/time` CPU)

Raw modules are the `standalone-dynamic` lane drivers compiled with
`optimize: 0` on `c8b4f0ef36`. Box load was 110–390 on 8 cores for the whole
run, so wall time was 3–7× CPU time. The table uses CPU seconds, which are
close to what an idle machine would take. "O4" means `-O4 --skip-pass=flatten`;
the aborted first `-O4` run cost another 3.7 / 13.5 / 9.5 / 13.4 CPU-s.

| package | raw | O1 | O2 | O3 | O4 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| hono | 1,198,739 B | 9.2 s · 700,287 B | 19.4 s · 628,989 B | 28.7 s · 605,863 B | 30.0 s · 604,406 B |
| moment | 2,688,019 B | 16.7 s · 1,906,795 B | 51.1 s · 1,840,535 B | 66.6 s · 1,819,542 B | 68.3 s · 1,816,804 B |
| lodash-es | 5,822,763 B | 38.4 s · 4,233,275 B | 122.1 s · 3,842,673 B | 233.9 s · 3,632,177 B | 251.8 s · 3,627,787 B |
| axios | 9,260,766 B | 56.8 s · 5,565,338 B | 140.8 s · 4,196,091 B | killed at 3,600 s wall | killed at 3,600 s wall (load 29 at start); ≈38 min in #6732 · 3,820,273 B |

Runtime speed (wasm-only, interleaved rounds, same seed, median µs/op, all
checksums equal):

| package | raw | O1 | O2 | O3 | O4 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| hono | 17.4 | 16.4 | 21.3 | 11.9 | 15.7 |
| moment | 5,411 | 3,807 | 3,712 | 4,088 | 3,886 |
| lodash-es | 216 | 269 | 234 | 285 | 248 |

Under this load, O1–O4 are within noise of each other on all three packages.
The only clear effect is moment's raw module being ~40 % slower. Level mostly
changes **binary size**: O2 is +1–6 % over O4, and O1 is +16–46 %. **O3 costs
about as much as O4 without Flatten** (hono 28.7 vs 30.0 s, moment 66.6 vs
68.3 s, lodash-es 233.9 vs 251.8 s), because O4 = O3 plus `flatten`,
`simplify-locals-notee-nostructure` and `local-cse` (from a `BINARYEN_PASS_DEBUG`
pass listing). So O3 cannot rescue an O4 timeout.

Cost is **superlinear** in module size above ~6 MB. Per raw MB, O3/O4 cost
24–25 CPU-s on hono and moment but 40–43 on lodash-es. On axios, both O3 and
O4 without Flatten ran past a 1-hour wall limit. The second of those runs
started at load 29, when the box was nearly idle. By contrast, O2 on axios
took 140.8 CPU-s. That is why the O4 ceiling is a hard 7 MB and not a
per-MB estimate.

## Implementation Plan (executed)

1. `src/optimize.ts`
   - `OptimizeOptions.timeoutMs`: a per-invocation wall-clock limit for the
     CLI, default 600 s as before. `OptimizeResult.timedOut` is set when the
     run hits it.
   - `wasmOptFailure()` reduces a failed run to readable lines. It drops the
     Emscripten source-line dump, the caret line and the JS stack. A timeout
     reads `wasm-opt timed out after N ms`. The #4586 retry's failure now
     comes **first** (`retry without flatten failed: …`), so the 800-char
     cut can no longer drop it. This covers the diagnostics half of #6732.
   - Successful output is unchanged: base and fix give the same hash for
     `gc`/`standalone` × `-O2/-O3/-O4`.
2. `scripts/lib/npm-compat-opt-budget.mjs` (new)
   - Size plan: raw ≤ 7 MB → O4, ≤ 12 MB → O2, else O1. The ladder is
     4 → 2 → 1, skipping O3 for the reason above.
   - Failure or timeout steps down one rung. If every rung fails, the lane
     measures the raw module as `optimizationLevel: 0`,
     `optimizationVerified: false`. It never reports an error for a valid
     module.
   - Deadline mode, for a bounded child: a non-final rung gets at most 60 %
     of the time left. A rung is skipped outright when its measured CPU floor
     (O4 25, O3 23, O2 15, O1 6 s per raw MB) cannot fit.
   - The record carries `optimizationLevel` (the level that produced the
     artifact), `optimizationLevelRequested`, `optimizationLevelReason`,
     `optimizationAttempts[]`, `rawBinaryBytes` and `optimizeDurationMs`.
   - `optimizationReceiptHolds()` is the report's receipt check. A lowered
     level passes only when its last attempt produced it.
3. `scripts/generate-npm-compat-report.mjs`
   - `compileNpmCompatPerfLane` compiles standalone lanes with
     `optimize: false`, then runs the budgeted optimizer.
   - `compileDurationMs` still includes optimization. Every post-compile
     failure record reports the actual level.
   - `standaloneLaneInChild` passes `--lane-budget-ms`. The child keeps 25 %
     of it for instantiation and measurement.
   - JS-host lanes are untouched and keep the integrated O4 request.
4. `scripts/compiler-extension-boundaries.json`: the `optional-binaryen-provider-v1`
   record gets the new `src/optimize.ts` content hash. `getBinaryenModule` is
   unchanged and re-reviewed.

## Resolution

Lanes are `standalone-dynamic`, run locally one at a time at the same load.

| lane | before (`c8b4f0ef36`) | after |
|---|---|---|
| axios | `optimization-error` after 837,661 ms: `wasm-opt -O4 failed: unexpected expr type … Flatten.cpp:231! Aborted() … var Module=typeof Module…` (retry reason cut off) | **no optimizer error.** Planned `-O2` (raw 9,260,766 B > the 7 MB O4 ceiling). `-O2` timed out at 600 s under load, and `-O1` produced 5,565,338 B, recorded `optimizationLevel: 1`. Next gate: `host-import-error: standalone binary retained 57 host import(s)` (23 at `-O2`) → [#6746](https://js2wasm.loopdive.com/dashboard/issue.html?slug=6746-standalone-axios-retained-host-imports) |
| lodash-es | `optimization-error` after 902,967 ms: same Flatten text; the retry was killed at 600 s under load | **`measured`**, checksum 54 = 54, 0 imports. `-O4` timed out at 600 s under load, and `-O2` produced 3,842,673 B, recorded `optimizationLevel: 2`, `optimizationLevelReason: "-O4 timed out"`. On an unloaded box, `-O4` (251.8 CPU-s) is expected to finish. |

Both "after" runs were at load 30–390 on 8 cores. That is why both lanes
stepped down a rung. The attempt log records each step.

Tests: `tests/issue-6742-wasm-opt-budget.test.ts`.

- Parent `src/optimize.ts`: 2 of the 2 optimizer tests fail (the timeout
  test and the retry-text test).
- Parent tree: the whole file fails, because the new module does not exist
  there.
- Fix: 10 / 10 pass. This includes a real `try_table` fixture through the
  lane optimizer at O4 (Flatten omitted), and the same fixture at a
  budget-lowered O2. Both run correctly.

## Update 2026-10-05 — refresh onto main; the overrun names its phase

On main (`b6324ee6d1`), five standalone-dynamic lanes end in the same record:
`<lane> lane exceeded the Nms harness budget (compile-budget)`, with
`optimizationLevel: 4` (typescript 600 s, eslint 180 s, axios 120 s, three
180 s, stylelint 120 s). That `4` is only the requested level, stamped on every
failed record. The record cannot say whether codegen or wasm-opt ran out of time,
and for at least three of the five it was codegen.

Two changes on top of the merge:

1. **Phase marker** (`scripts/lib/npm-compat-opt-budget.mjs`
   `writeLanePhase` / `takeLanePhase` / `laneBudgetOverrun`). A bounded lane
   child writes `<partial-output>.phase` as each phase starts: `codegen`,
   `wasm-opt -O<n> (limit N ms)` (through a new `onAttempt` hook that skipped
   rungs never fire), and `instantiate and measure`. When the parent kills the
   child at the budget, the record now reads, for example,
   `… exceeded the 120000ms harness budget during codegen (started at 12996 ms) (compile-budget)`,
   with `phase: "codegen"`.
2. **The #4586 Flatten retry stays inside a caller's `timeoutMs`.** Before, the
   retry got a fresh `timeoutMs`, so one O4 rung could run for its limit plus
   the whole aborted first run. Now, when the caller passes `timeoutMs`, the
   retry gets only what the first run left. Without `timeoutMs` (every JS-host
   and CLI caller), each run still gets 600 s.

### Lane status, before → after

All runs are local `standalone-dynamic` runs on a shared box at load 80–390 on
8 cores, so wall times are 3–10× CPU time. "Unbounded" means the in-process
`--perf-only --lane standalone-dynamic` run. "Bounded" means the exact
`standaloneLaneInChild` command line under the given budget.

| package (budget) | before (main record) | after, bounded | after, unbounded: next real error |
|---|---|---|---|
| axios (120 s) | `compile-budget`, no phase | 120 s: `compile-budget` **during codegen** (codegen alone ran past 120 s at this load). 480 s: **`host-import-error`, 62 imports**, after 430 s total: O4 skipped by its cost floor, O2 timed out at 130.9 s, O1 timed out at 85.7 s, so level 0 was measured | `host-import-error`, 57 imports at `-O1` (5,474,968 B from 6,766,103 B raw). O4's retry and O2 each timed out at 600 s → [#6746](https://js2wasm.loopdive.com/dashboard/issue.html?slug=6746-standalone-axios-retained-host-imports) |
| three (180 s) | `compile-budget`, no phase | not run bounded: unbounded codegen alone took 1,294 s, so the bounded run can only end `during codegen` | `compile-error` in codegen, before wasm-opt: host import `env.requestAnimationFrame` leaks into the standalone binary |
| stylelint (120 s) | `compile-budget`, no phase | as for three: codegen alone took 867 s | `compile-error` in codegen, before wasm-opt: host import `env.isDynamicPattern` leaks into the standalone binary |
| eslint (180 s) | `compile-budget`, no phase | 180 s: `compile-budget` **during codegen** (started at 56 s) | not reached: the in-process run was still in codegen after 49 min wall at this load |
| typescript (600 s) | `compile-budget`, no phase | not run (JS-host compile alone exceeds 600 s on CI) | not run |

So the wasm-opt ladder is the right fix only for lanes whose codegen fits the
budget, and of these five that is axios at most. For three, stylelint and (at
this load) eslint, the budget runs out in codegen. Three and stylelint then
end in a codegen compile error before any optimizer runs, so a lower wasm-opt
level cannot help them. The phase marker now makes that visible on the
dashboard. Their next errors are filed as
[#6842](https://js2wasm.loopdive.com/dashboard/issue.html?slug=6842-standalone-three-requestanimationframe-host-import-leak)
(three) and
[#6843](https://js2wasm.loopdive.com/dashboard/issue.html?slug=6843-standalone-stylelint-globby-isdynamicpattern-host-import-leak)
(stylelint).

JS-host output is unchanged. `gc` `-O2` and `-O4` binaries of a `try_table`
fixture and a loop/string fixture hash the same with main's `src/optimize.ts`
and this branch's (`95c63e88…`, `b18a6a71…`, `930500bd…`, `d71619c2…`). The new
retry bound applies only when a caller passes `timeoutMs`, and only the
standalone lane does that.

Tests (`tests/issue-6742-wasm-opt-budget.test.ts`, 14 tests):

- The retry-bound test fails on the parent `src/optimize.ts`: the retry got a
  fresh 3 s and succeeded past the limit.
- Its control passes on both trees. Without `timeoutMs`, the same slow fake
  `wasm-opt` retry still succeeds.
- The phase-marker tests need the new exports, so they fail on the parent
  tree.

## Residuals

- At CI's 120–180 s child budgets, a lane whose standalone codegen takes
  longer than the budget still ends `compile-budget`. It now ends `during
  codegen`, which is accurate. Raising the per-package budgets, or making
  standalone codegen faster, is a separate decision.
- The aborted first `-O4` run is still paid on every `try_table` module
  (3.7–13.5 CPU-s here). Skipping it needs an exact "module uses
  `try_table`" signal. The optimizer only sees bytes, and a heuristic would
  change JS-host output.
- CI's 120 s child budget for a host-blocked package is often smaller than
  codegen alone (axios codegen ≈ 300 s wall here). Such a lane now ends
  `measured` at level 0 or `compile-budget`. It no longer ends in
  `optimization-error`. Raising the budget is a separate call.
