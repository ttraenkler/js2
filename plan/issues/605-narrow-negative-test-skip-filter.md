# Issue #605: Narrow negative test skip filter

## Problem

Runtime negative tests (tests with `negative.phase === "runtime"`) are being
caught by `shouldSkip` filters (eval, with, new Function, etc.) and skipped
before they can be compiled and run. These tests **expect** runtime errors from
constructs like eval/with -- they should be compiled and run so we can verify
the compiler/runtime detects the error.

Parse/early/resolution negative tests were already handled before `shouldSkip`
(line 2065), but runtime negative tests were still going through all skip
filters.

## Solution

For runtime negative tests, bypass the `shouldSkip` call entirely. The
`HANGING_TESTS` check (line 2054) still runs before this point, so known
hangers are still caught.

The runtime negative test flow then proceeds normally: compile, instantiate,
run. If execution throws/traps, the test passes. If execution succeeds without
error, the test fails (since it expected a runtime error).

## Files Changed

- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- wrapped `shouldSkip` call in `if (!isRuntimeNegative)` guard

## Implementation Summary

Moved the `isRuntimeNegative` variable declaration before the `shouldSkip` call
and wrapped `shouldSkip` in a conditional that only runs for non-runtime-negative
tests. This lets ~892 previously-skipped runtime negative tests flow through to
compilation and execution, where they can be properly evaluated as pass/fail
based on whether they throw the expected runtime error.
