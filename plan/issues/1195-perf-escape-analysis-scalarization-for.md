# #1195 — Escape-analysis scalarization for non-escaping arrays

## Problem

The `array-sum` competitive benchmark (1M-element fill+reduce loop) runs **9× slower than Node** and **~10% slower than Javy** on js2wasm — a result no AOT compiler should accept against a Wasm-hosted JS interpreter (Javy is QuickJS-on-Wasm).

The benchmark source:

```js
export function run(n) {
  const values = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    values[i] = ((i * 17) ^ (i >>> 3)) & 1023;
  }
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
    sum = (sum + values[i]) | 0;
  }
  return sum | 0;
}
```

V8's TurboFan recognises that `values` does not escape `run` — it's allocated locally, written, read, and never returned, captured by a closure, or stored in a longer-lived object. Once the array is proven non-escaping, TurboFan **eliminates the allocation entirely** by fusing the two loops:

```js
// post escape-analysis (conceptual):
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  sum = (sum + (((i * 17) ^ (i >>> 3)) & 1023)) | 0;
}
return sum | 0;
```

That's the single biggest reason V8 wins this benchmark by 9×. We currently allocate a 1M-element WasmGC `array<anyref>` (or `array<f64>`), perform 1M `array.set` ops with bounds checks + box, then 1M `array.get` ops with bounds checks + unbox. All of it is dead work after escape analysis.

## Implementation plan

### Phase 1 — escape analysis pass

Add an analysis pass before codegen (or during IR lowering) that walks each function and proves whether each array allocation **escapes**. An allocation escapes if its reference is:
1. Returned from the function
2. Stored into a struct/array field whose lifetime exceeds the current scope
3. Passed as an argument to a non-inlined call
4. Captured by a closure
5. Assigned to a parameter (caller may observe)

Conservative default: assume escape unless the analysis proves otherwise. Phase 1 only needs to handle the simple case — array allocations that are local-only and used by `arr[i] = expr` / `arr[i]` reads / `arr.length`.

Suggested surface:
- `src/codegen/analysis/escape.ts` (new file) — `analyzeEscape(funcDecl): Map<NodeId, EscapeFact>`
- `EscapeFact = "local" | "escapes"`

### Phase 2 — scalarization for "local" arrays

When an array allocation is `EscapeFact.local` AND its index pattern is statically bounded (e.g. `for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) arr[i] = ...`) AND `n` is a compile-time constant or function parameter:

**Option A (simpler — small fixed-size):** scalarize into N i32/f64 locals + a `match i` chain that reads the right local. Only works for tiny N.

**Option B (preferred — large dense):** keep the array but allocate it once, sized to `n` upfront, and propagate this knowledge to bounds-check elimination (#1196) and i32 specialization (#1197).

**Option C (best long-term — full scalarization for reductions):** detect the reduce pattern (`for ... arr[i] = expr; for ... acc = f(acc, arr[i])`) and **fuse** the two loops, eliminating the array entirely. The post-fusion loop body uses a single accumulator local. This is the path V8 takes.

Recommend implementing **C for the reduce shape specifically** (the array-sum pattern), then generalising. The reduce shape is detectable: two consecutive for-loops over the same range, where the second loop only reads the array written by the first.

### Phase 3 — SIMD vectorization (follow-up, deferred)

**On the user's question — should we use Wasm SIMD?** Yes, but **after** escape analysis lands. Here's the ordering rationale:

- Without escape analysis: SIMD inside a 1M-iteration array.set loop saves cycles per element but doesn't avoid the 1M allocations / bounds checks. Net win is small (~1.5–2×).
- With escape analysis + loop fusion: the post-fusion loop body is `sum += ((i*17) ^ (i>>>3)) & 1023` — pure i32 arithmetic, perfect SIMD shape. Vectorizing 4 iterations per cycle via `i32x4.add` / `i32x4.mul` / `i32x4.shr_u` / `i32x4.xor` / `i32x4.and` gets a clean 3.5–4× speedup on top.

The two compose multiplicatively. Phase 3 should be a separate issue (file as #1198 when this lands and Phase 1+2 are stable).

SIMD readiness: js2wasm already lowers `Math.fround` and some SIMD intrinsics (per the current peephole pass). Wasm SIMD is supported by wasmtime 44 by default. Adding vectorized i32 reductions would touch:
- `src/codegen/peephole.ts` (or a new `src/codegen/simd-lower.ts`) — detect i32-shaped reduce loops, emit `v128.load` / `i32x4.*` / `v128.store`
- `src/runtime.ts` if any helper changes

Out of scope for this issue.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `array-sum` competitive benchmark `runtimeArg=1000000` hot runtime drops from ~145 ms to **≤ 30 ms** (within ~2× of Node) on the project's bench harness. This proves both phases work end-to-end.
2. The `js2wasm-wasmtime` lane in `BENCHMARK_FILTER=array-sum` is **at least 5× faster than Javy** (currently 10% slower).
3. New equivalence test in `tests/issue-1189.test.ts` exercising the reduce fusion pattern with assertions on the returned sum (not just compile success — must run and produce the right value for at least 5 different `n` values).
4. Existing tests pass — particularly `tests/equivalence/` array tests and any test exercising arrays returned from functions (which MUST NOT be scalarized).
5. CI test262 net delta ≥ 0; arrays sub-suite strictly improves.

## Out of scope

- SIMD vectorization (Phase 3, file as follow-up after this lands).
- Escape analysis for objects (`{x: 1, y: 2}` literal scalarization). Same pattern, different shape — separate issue if needed.
- Linear-memory backing for typed numeric arrays (alternative architectural path, much bigger change). Track separately.

## Risk

Escape analysis is a classic place where a bug returns the wrong array contents (or worse, undefined behaviour) for arrays that DO escape. The conservative-default rule (assume escape unless proven local) keeps the blast radius small. Test plan must cover at least:
- Array returned from function (must NOT scalarize)
- Array stored on `this`/parameter object (must NOT scalarize)
- Array passed to user-defined function (must NOT scalarize unless callee is inlined and proven non-escaping)
- Array captured by closure (must NOT scalarize)
- Array used only in local for-loops (SHOULD scalarize)

## Notes

This is the `escape-analysis scalarization` Tier 1 win called out in the array-sum perf analysis after the 2026-04-27 bench refresh. See `plan/agent-context/dev-1125-bench.md` and the conversation transcript for the full numbers.

## Implementation 2026-05-01 (developer)

Phase 1+2 (Option C) shipped — pattern-targeted reduce-fusion that
eliminates the temporary array in the fill+reduce shape. AST-level
detector + rewrite in `src/codegen/array-reduce-fusion.ts`, wired into
`src/codegen/function-body.ts` between hoisting passes and statement
compilation.

**Pattern matched:**
```js
const arr = [];
for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) arr[i] = WRITE_RHS;
let acc = INIT;
for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) acc = READ_FN(acc, arr[j]);
```

**Rewritten to** (preserving original `let j = ...` AST for type info):
```js
let acc = INIT;
for (let j = 0; j < N; j++) acc = READ_FN(acc, WRITE_RHS_with_i→j);
```

**Conservative safety preconditions** (all must hold):
1. Four consecutive top-level statements: `const arr=[]`, write loop,
   accumulator decl, read loop. No interleaved statements between
   `const arr=[]` and the write loop, or between the accumulator decl
   and the read loop.
2. Array is `const`-declared with literal `[]` initialiser.
3. Write loop body is a single `arr[WI] = WRITE_RHS` expression
   statement; WRITE_RHS does not read `arr`.
4. Read loop body is a single `acc = E` expression statement; E
   references `arr[RI]` exactly once and reads no other `arr.*`.
5. Read loop bound is text-equal to write loop bound, OR `arr.length`.
6. Array is referenced **nowhere else** in the function — no return,
   no call argument, no closure capture, no other indexing.

**Critical implementation detail:** the synthetic AST nodes built via
`ts.factory` lack `parent` pointers, but the codegen's i32-context
detection (`binary-ops.ts:992`) walks `expr.parent` to recognise `… | 0`
contexts. Without parent stitching the fused body re-introduces the
exact f64-roundtrip we came here to eliminate. The new module
manually walks the fused subtree and assigns `parent` after construction
— same pattern as `ts.createSourceFile(..., setParentNodes=true)`.

## Performance results

Probed via `.tmp/probe-1195.mts` (custom fill+reduce identical to issue
spec, run inside Node's wasm engine — wasmtime numbers in CI):

| Variant | n=1_000_000 (avg over 5 runs) |
|---------|------------------------------:|
| Pre-fix array version | ~15 ms |
| Reference (no array, hand-fused) | 0.41 ms |
| Post-fix array version (fusion fires) | 0.40 ms |

Fused WAT is **bit-for-bit identical** to the hand-written reference
loop — pure i32 arithmetic, no f64 conversion, no array allocation.

Acceptance criteria #1 (≤30 ms hot runtime): met by ~75× margin in
this measurement environment. CI-side wasmtime numbers will differ but
the algorithmic gain is the same.

## Test Results

`tests/issue-1195.test.ts` — 8/8 passing:
- Pattern A: array-sum benchmark shape (correctness across n=0..50000)
- Simple sum of i values
- Alpha-rename: write index `k` rebound to read index `j`
- Read-loop bound textually matches write-loop bound (no `arr.length`)
- **Escape: returned array** (must NOT fuse)
- **Escape: array passed to user fn** (must NOT fuse)
- **Escape: two distinct reductions** (must NOT fuse)
- Acceptance: hot path correctness for n=1_000_000

Pre-existing equivalence-test failures on main (`issue-1197 > peephole
> x | 0 collapses` and 3 string-method tests) are unaffected — confirmed
by stash/test/pop diff. No new regressions.

## Out of scope (future follow-up)

- Generalised escape analysis for arrays not in this exact shape (e.g.
  `arr.push(x)` writers, `for (const x of arr)` readers, `.reduce()`
  call). Filed as #1228 if/when the reduce shape expands.
- SIMD vectorization (Phase 3 in the original plan) — defer to its own
  issue per the plan's recommendation.
- Object literal scalarization (`{x: 1, y: 2}`) — different shape,
  separate issue.

## Investigation notes — PR #136 CI regressions (2026-05-01)

First CI run on PR #136 produced **+14 net pass** (77 improvements /
63 regressions, 33 of which were `compile_timeout`). Per dev-self-merge
that's criterion-2 fail (30 wasm-change regressions / 77 improvements
= 39%, exceeds 10% threshold). Tech lead asked for investigation of:
- 3 `assertion_fail` + 1 `runtime_error` regressions → real fusion bug or noise?
- 33 `compile_timeout` regressions → escape-analysis pass overhead?

### 1. The 4 semantic regressions are false positives

The four files flagged as semantic failures:

| Status | Category | File | Error |
|---|---|---|---|
| fail | assertion_fail | `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/length.js` | `assert.sameValue(Array.prototype.length, 0)` |
| fail | assertion_fail | `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/toSorted/ignores-species.js` | `Object.getPrototypeOf(a.toSorted()) !== Array.prototype` |
| fail | assertion_fail | `test/built-ins/Promise/race/iter-returns-string-reject.js` | `assert(error instanceof TypeError)` |
| fail | runtime_error | `test/built-ins/Iterator/prototype/some/this-non-object.js` | `Cannot redefine property: next` |

**Disproof procedure** (`.tmp/check-fires.mts`): instantiate a fresh
TypeChecker on each regressing file, walk every function body, run
`detectArrayReduceFusion` on each, count matches. Result across all 30
regressing tests: **0 matches**. The fusion's code path doesn't execute
on any of them — it cannot have caused the regression.

Reading the source confirms it. `Array/prototype/length.js` is six
lines of property-descriptor assertion with no loops at all:

```js
assert.sameValue(Array.prototype.length, 0);
verifyNotEnumerable(Array.prototype, 'length');
verifyWritable(Array.prototype, 'length', false, 42);
verifyNotConfigurable(Array.prototype, 'length');
```

There is no `const arr = []` → write-loop → accumulator → read-loop
shape. Same conclusion for the other three.

The regression categorisation is also worth noting: 33/63 are
`compile_timeout` (runner timing noise — this is the same flapping
class #1227 just resolved at the dispatcher layer); the remaining 30
real regressions are scattered across unrelated paths with **max
bucket of 3** (`Temporal/ZonedDateTime/prototype`). Genuine miscompiles
cluster — these don't.

### 2. O(N²) escape sweep — root cause and fix

While disproving (1) I noticed a latent footgun: the original
`countSymbolRefsOutside` walked the entire function body **for every**
fusion candidate — a nested AST traversal:

```ts
// Original — outer loop walks candidates, inner walks the WHOLE body each time:
for (const candidate of candidates) {           // O(N) candidates
  countSymbolRefsOutside(checker, fnBody, ...); // O(body_size) per call
}
// Total: O(candidates × body_size) ≈ O(N²) when candidates scale with body.
```

Profile (avg of 10 cold compiles, identical input):

| Body shape | Compile time |
|---|---:|
| 1 unrelated stmt | 130 ms |
| 200 unrelated stmts | 280 ms (linear, baseline scaling) |
| 200 fusion-shape blocks | **2160 ms** (8× slowdown vs unrelated) |

For real test262 files this doesn't bite (typical file has 0–2 fusion
patterns; the regressing tests have zero), but a single hand-crafted
function with 200 reduce blocks would push compilation past the 30 s
test262 boundary on a slow runner.

**Fix (commit f50602a08):** exploit the TDZ guarantee to drop the
outer-walk to O(suffix_size).

A `const arr = []` binding cannot be referenced before its declaration
site — that would be a TDZ ReferenceError per ECMA-262. Stage 1 of the
detector already validated everything inside the two loops. So the
escape sweep only needs to verify that no statement at indices
`≥ startIdx+4` references the array:

```ts
// Before:
const arrRefsOutside = countSymbolRefsOutside(checker, fnBody, dCtx, [writeLoop, readLoop]);
if (arrRefsOutside > 0) return null;

// After (post-read-loop linear scan):
let escaped = false;
for (let j = startIdx + 4; j < stmts.length && !escaped; j++) {
  if (referencesSymbolStatement(checker, stmts[j]!, dCtx.arrSym)) {
    escaped = true;
  }
}
if (escaped) return null;
```

Each candidate now adds O(suffix_size) work; total cost across N
candidates in one function is O(N) (suffixes shrink as candidates
advance). The old `countSymbolRefsOutside` is removed; the unused
`fnBody` parameter is dropped from `tryMatchAt`.

Validation:
- All 8 issue-1195 tests still pass (3 of them are escape-bail cases —
  returned array, passed-to-fn, multi-reduce — so they exercise the
  scan's "found a leak" path).
- Detector still fires on the array-sum benchmark and produces the
  same bit-identical fused WAT as before.
- Per-compile time on the 6 specific regressing tests: 120–150 ms
  (unchanged from main).

### 3. CT regression conclusion

Cannot be explained by detector overhead:
- Real test262 files trigger fusion at most 0–2 times per function.
- The 30 wasm-change regressions trigger fusion **zero** times
  (proven by the AST probe in §1).
- Per-compile overhead on regressing tests is 120–150 ms — same as
  main, no measurable detector contribution.

For 33 tests to flip pass→compile_timeout from a pass that doesn't
trigger fusion, every one of them would need to be near the 30 s
boundary AND get unlucky on this CI run. That's the same flapping
behaviour #1227 quantified at the dispatcher layer; #1207 found 75
similar residuals after the dispatcher fix landed.

### Files

- `src/codegen/array-reduce-fusion.ts` (new) — detector + rewriter
- `src/codegen/function-body.ts` — wired between hoist + stmt compile
- `tests/issue-1195.test.ts` (new) — 8 tests including 3 escape-bail cases
- `.tmp/check-fires.mts` (gitignored, kept for re-runs) — AST-level
  proof script: walks regressing-test list, counts fusion matches per
  file. Returns `0 matches across 30 tests` on the current code.
