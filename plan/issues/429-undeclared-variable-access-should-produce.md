# #429 — Undeclared variable access should produce ReferenceError (71 tests)

## Problem

71 tests across 15+ expression categories fail because the compiler does not handle undeclared variables correctly. Two distinct sub-problems:

### Sub-problem 1: Immutable global assignment (37 CE)

When a test does `x = 1` where `x` was previously undeclared, the compiler creates an immutable global for `x` but then tries to assign to it, producing:

```
immutable global #N cannot be assigned
```

This affects tests like `S11.9.1_A2.1_T2.js` (equals), `S11.4.9_A2.1_T2.js` (logical-not), and many more across all expression categories.

### Sub-problem 2: Missing ReferenceError for undeclared reads (34 fail)

Tests like `x + 1` where `x` is never declared expect a ReferenceError to be thrown. The compiler instead silently treats `x` as a global with a default value, so no error is thrown and the test fails with "returned 0".

Pattern: `_A2.1_T2` and `_A2.1_T3` tests across addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, bitwise-and/or/xor, shifts, comparison, equality, logical-not.

## Root cause

The original issue description was misleading. The actual root cause is a **global index shifting bug** in `fixupModuleGlobalIndices`:

When `addStringConstantGlobal` is called during function compilation (e.g. for "true"/"false" from `emitBoolToString`), it inserts new import globals that shift the absolute indices of all module-defined globals. The `fixupModuleGlobalIndices` function is responsible for updating all existing `global.get`/`global.set` instructions, but it had three gaps:

1. **Missing `catches`/`catchAll` traversal**: The function recursed into `body`, `then`, and `else` arrays but not into `catches` or `catchAll` inside try instructions.

2. **Missing `savedBodies` fixup**: When compiling nested constructs (try/catch, if/else), `fctx.body` is swapped to a fresh array via `pushBody`. The previous body is stored in `fctx.savedBodies`. The fixup only processed `ctx.currentFunc.body`, missing all saved bodies.

3. **Missing index map updates**: The `moduleGlobals`, `capturedGlobals`, and `staticProps` maps store absolute global indices. When new import globals are inserted, these maps become stale.

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Reduce "immutable global cannot be assigned" CEs to zero
- [x] `fixupModuleGlobalIndices` traverses catches/catchAll in try instructions
- [x] `fixupModuleGlobalIndices` shifts savedBodies arrays
- [x] `fixupModuleGlobalIndices` updates moduleGlobals/capturedGlobals/staticProps maps
- [ ] Undeclared variable reads throw ReferenceError (or trap) — deferred, requires instanceof for built-in Error types
- [ ] A2.1_T2/T3 pattern tests pass — deferred, same blocker

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Fixed `fixupModuleGlobalIndices` in `src/codegen/index.ts`:

1. Added `catches` and `catchAll` traversal to the recursive `shiftGlobalIndices` helper
2. Added `savedBodies` processing to fix indices in outer body arrays swapped out during nested block compilation
3. Added index map updates (`moduleGlobals`, `capturedGlobals`, `staticProps`) so code compiled after the shift uses correct indices

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — `fixupModuleGlobalIndices` function (3 additions)
- `tests/equivalence/global-index-shift-trycatch.test.ts` — new test file (3 tests)

### Results
- 0 "immutable global" CEs across 642 expression tests (was 37+)
- 2 additional test262 tests now pass
- 3 new equivalence tests pass
- No regressions
