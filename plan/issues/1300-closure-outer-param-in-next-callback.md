# #1300 — Closure capturing outer param inside Next-callback lambda null-derefs

## Summary

A function-typed parameter passed into another function works correctly.
But if the receiving function passes that parameter into ANOTHER function
that takes a `Next`-typed callback, and that callback is an INLINE lambda
that captures the outer parameter, calling the lambda null-derefs.

## Repro

```typescript
type Next = () => string;
type Mw = (next: Next) => string;

function compose2(a: Mw, b: Mw): string {
  // Inner lambda `() => b(...)` captures outer parameter `b`. The call
  // to `b(...)` inside the lambda null-derefs at runtime.
  return a(() => b(() => "end"));
}

export function test(): string {
  return compose2(
    (next: Next) => "<a>" + next() + "</a>",
    (next: Next) => "<b>" + next() + "</b>",
  );  // expected "<a><b>end</b></a>", crashes with null pointer deref
}
```

Calling a `Next` parameter directly (not capturing it in another inline
lambda) works:

```typescript
function callIt(f: Next): string { return f(); }  // OK
```

Hoisting the inner step to a module-level function also works (same body
but no closure):

```typescript
function endNext(): string { return "end"; }
function step2(): string { return runMw(2, endNext); }
runMw(1, step2);  // OK
```

## Likely cause

Inline lambdas inside a function that need to capture parameters allocate
a closure environment. The capture for function-typed parameters appears
to lose the boxed-fn unwrap step (related to #1298 but distinct — here
the storage is the closure env struct, not a user struct).

## Where to fix

- `src/codegen/expressions/closures.ts` (or wherever closure env
  packing happens for inline lambdas).
- Verify the closure env's storage of function-typed captures uses the
  same unbox-and-call_ref path as #1298 will install for class fields.

## Acceptance criteria

1. The repro returns `"<a><b>end</b></a>"`.
2. The compose pattern documented in `tests/stress/hono-tier5.test.ts`
   middleware section works without hoisting steps to module level.

## Notes

- Tier 5 currently uses module-level step functions
  (`step2`, `step23`, `endNext`) as a workaround. The middleware
  ordering / arity contract is exercised end-to-end via the workaround.
- Likely shares a fix with #1298 (function-typed value storage). May
  collapse into a single fix once the call-site unwrap is generalized.
