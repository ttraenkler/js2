# Issue #256: Unknown function: f -- locally declared functions not found

## Status: done

## Summary

17 tests fail with "Unknown function: f" (or similar). These tests declare a function locally (`function f() { ... }`) and then call it, but the codegen does not find the function in the scope. This differs from "Unknown identifier" because the function was properly declared, just not registered in the function table.

## Root Cause

Functions declared inside other functions (nested function declarations) may not be registered in the local function scope. The pre-pass that collects function declarations may miss functions inside if-blocks, loop bodies, or other nested statement positions.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- function declaration collection
- Tests affected: ~17 compile errors

## Expected Impact

Fixes ~17 compile errors.

## Suggested Approach

1. In the function declaration pre-pass, ensure nested function declarations in all statement positions are registered
2. Handle function declarations inside if-blocks, for-loops, while-loops, and switch cases
3. This may overlap with #250 (for-loop function declarations)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Nested function declarations are found when called
- [ ] At least 12 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Notes

### Changes made:
Extended `hoistFunctionDeclarations` in `src/codegen/statements.ts` to recurse into:
- `for` loop bodies
- `while` loop bodies
- `do-while` loop bodies
- `for-in` / `for-of` loop bodies
- `switch` statement cases
- `labeled` statements

Previously it only recursed into `if` blocks, `try/catch` blocks, and plain blocks. This matches JS semantics where function declarations are hoisted to the nearest enclosing function scope regardless of where they appear.

### Tests added:
4 equivalence tests:
- Nested function in for loop body
- Nested function in while loop body
- Nested function in switch case
- Nested function in do-while loop

## Complexity: S
