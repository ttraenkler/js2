# [ts2wasm] Codegen: Inline single-use function type signatures in WAT output

## Summary

The compiler emits named type aliases (`$add_type`, `$main_type`, etc.) for every function, even when each type is referenced exactly once. This adds visual clutter to the WAT text output without any binary-level benefit — the Wasm binary type section is mandatory regardless.

## Current Output

```wat
(type $add_type (func (param f64 f64) (result f64)))
(type $main_type (func))
(func $add (type 0) ...)
(func $main (type 1) ...)
```

## Expected Output

```wat
(func $add (param f64 f64) (result f64) ...)
(func $main ...)
```

The assembler creates type section entries automatically from inlined signatures. Named type definitions should only be emitted when:
- The type is referenced by multiple functions (shared signature)
- The type is referenced by `call_indirect` or `ref.func` (table-based dispatch)
- The type is a struct/array type used by GC instructions

## Fix

During WAT serialization:
1. Count references to each type index
2. If a function type is used exactly once and only by a `func` definition, inline the signature on the `func` and skip the standalone `(type ...)` declaration
3. If a type is used more than once or by non-func contexts (tables, `call_indirect`), keep the named declaration

## Priority

Low — cosmetic improvement to WAT readability. No binary size or runtime impact.

## Checklist

- [x] Track type reference counts during WAT emission
- [x] Inline single-use function signatures on `func` definitions
- [x] Keep named types for shared signatures, struct/array types, and table-referenced types
- [x] Update any WAT snapshot tests that assert on type declarations

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added type reference counting and single-use type inlining to the WAT text serializer in `src/emit/wat.ts`.

### Approach
- Added `computeInlineableTypes()` function that scans the entire module IR to count references to each type index from: function definitions, imports, tags, `call_indirect`/`call_ref` instructions, and block types with `kind === "type"`.
- A func type qualifies for inlining only when: (1) it is a plain `func` type (not struct/array/rec/sub), (2) it is referenced exactly once across the entire module, and (3) that single reference is from a `WasmFunction.typeIdx` (not from imports, tags, call_indirect, call_ref, or block types).
- Added `walkInstrs()` and `walkBlockTypes()` helper functions to recursively traverse instruction trees including nested blocks, if/then/else, try/catch, and loops.
- Modified `emitWat()` to skip inlineable types in the type section and pass the inlineable set to `formatFunction()`.
- Modified `formatFunction()` to emit `(param ...) (result ...)` directly on the func line instead of `(type N)` for inlineable types.

### Files changed
- `src/emit/wat.ts` -- core implementation
- `tests/issue-319.test.ts` -- new test file (6 tests)

### Tests
- 6 new tests covering: WAT output verification (inlined signatures, no standalone type for single-use), valid Wasm binary production for simple/multiple/void functions.
- Full regression suite: 147/156 test files pass (same as before, no regressions).
