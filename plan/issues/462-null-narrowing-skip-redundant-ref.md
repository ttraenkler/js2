# Issue #462: Null narrowing in if-statement branches

## Problem
After `if (x !== null)`, the true branch should treat `x` as a non-null ref instead of `ref_null`. Previously, redundant `ref.is_null` guards were emitted inside the narrowed block for every property access or method call on the narrowed variable.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
1. Added `narrowedNonNull?: Set<string>` field to `FunctionContext` in `src/codegen/index.ts`
2. Added `detectNullNarrowing()` helper in `src/codegen/statements.ts` that detects patterns:
   - `x !== null`, `x != null`, `null !== x`, `null != x` -- narrows in THEN branch
   - `x === null`, `x == null`, `null === x`, `null == x` -- narrows in ELSE branch
3. Modified `compileIfStatement()` to save/restore the narrowed set around each branch, applying narrowing only to the correct branch
4. Modified `compileIdentifier()` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` to emit `ref.as_non_null` and return `ref` (instead of `ref_null`) when a variable is in the narrowed set -- this causes all downstream null guards to be skipped entirely
5. Applied same narrowing to captured globals and module globals

### What worked
- Clean scoping: narrowing is saved/restored per branch and cleared when leaving the if block
- The `ref.as_non_null` approach means downstream code (property access, method calls, element access) automatically skips null guards since they check `objResult.kind === "ref_null"`

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- added `narrowedNonNull` to FunctionContext
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- added `detectNullNarrowing()`, modified `compileIfStatement()`
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- modified `compileIdentifier()` for locals, captured globals, module globals
- `tests/equivalence/null-narrowing.test.ts` -- 5 new test cases

### Tests
- 5 new equivalence tests all pass
- 915/916 existing tests pass (1 pre-existing failure unrelated to this change)
