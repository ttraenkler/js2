# #546 — Remaining skip filters: small patterns (460 tests)

## Status: in-progress

Smaller skip patterns not covered by other issues:

| Filter | Skip | Feasibility | Status |
|--------|-----:|------------|--------|
| Object.defineProperty | 88 | Medium — needs property descriptor stubs | remaining |
| rest-destructuring numeric-key objects | 46 | Medium | remaining |
| tail-call optimization | 33 | Easy — Wasm has `return_call` | REMOVED |
| globalThis | 20 | Easy — compile as module global | already removed (#502) |
| global/arrow this reference | 17 | Medium | REMOVED |
| tagged template .raw | 16 | Easy — add .raw field to template array | REMOVED |
| tagged template IIFE/call tag | ~10 | Easy | REMOVED |
| tagged template chained | ~5 | Easy | REMOVED |
| tagged template object identity | ~5 | Easy | REMOVED |
| collection mutation in for-of | 15 | Medium — hang risk | remaining |
| IIFE patterns | 14 | Easy — should compile now | already removed |
| function .name descriptor | 12 | Medium — needs #490 | remaining |
| string variable concatenation | 11 | Easy — should compile now | already removed |
| typeof on member expression | 10 | Easy | already removed |

## Approach
Address in priority order. Many are quick filter removals (XS effort).

## Implementation Notes

Removed 5 active skip filters in test262-runner.ts:
1. **tail-call-optimization** — removed from UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES set. Tests will fail at runtime (stack overflow without return_call) but shouldn't be hidden.
2. **tagged template .raw access** — removed regex filter. Tests may fail at runtime but don't crash compiler.
3. **tagged template object identity** — removed regex filter.
4. **IIFE/call expression as tagged template tag** — removed regex filter.
5. **chained tagged templates** — removed regex filter.
6. **global/arrow this reference** — removed regex filter. Tests may fail at runtime.

Already removed in prior issues (confirmed still absent):
- IIFE patterns (removed previously)
- string variable concatenation (removed previously)
- typeof on member expression (removed previously)
- globalThis (removed from UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES in #502)

## Complexity: S-M (varies per pattern)
