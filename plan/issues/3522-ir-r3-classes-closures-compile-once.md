# #3522 — IR-only R3: compile-once classes, members, and closures

## Objective

Extend R2's prepare-before-emit ownership from top-level free functions to the
complete executable-unit census of an ordinary single-source program:

- class declarations and class expressions;
- explicit/default constructors;
- instance and static methods;
- instance and static getters/setters;
- instance field initializers and constructor parameter/default work;
- inheritance, `super`, inherited aliases, and class support wrappers;
- nested function declarations, function expressions, arrows, object methods,
  and every lifted closure body/trampoline/cache unit.

Every source body is Prepared and IR-emitted once or typed Unsupported and
direct-emitted once under the temporary hybrid policy. No class/member/closure
may be selected, silently skipped by integration, compiled direct, and then
patched.

## Current evidence

Class integration still depends on direct compilation as its ABI producer:

- `src/ir/select.ts:591-616` inventories constructors, instance methods, and
  static methods under legacy synthetic names. The comment still describes a
  selector-only/patch-later model.
- `src/ir/select.ts:700-705` explicitly admits ordinary static methods, but
  `src/ir/integration.ts:396-411` skips every static member. This is a concrete
  claimed-without-integration hole that a fallback histogram can miss.
- `src/ir/integration.ts:280-297` says class members and module init target
  legacy-preallocated slots. At `:393-445` it finds a class/member by flat
  display name, and at `:943-970` a type mismatch keeps the direct body.
- `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts:595-1465` combines class identity/layout/ABI
  planning with placeholder registration, inherited aliases, descriptors,
  static globals, and static-init queue mutation.
- `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts:1551-1740` then compiles constructor/default/
  field work directly. The source constructor body is split across
  `${Class}_new` and `${Class}_init` support functions
  (`:1043-1075`, `:1642-1692`). Those support units are not represented in the
  current `IrModule` contract.
- `src/codegen/declarations.ts:1872-2074` recursively eager/deferred-compiles
  class declarations/expressions. Capturing nested classes are routed through
  separate in-scope paths; a pre-emission unit inventory does not yet own that
  decision.
- `src/ir/from-ast.ts:537-545` can return lifted functions, but their identity,
  ABI slots, and failure are attached after the parent build. A lifted failure
  can therefore demote a parent only after other legacy effects exist.

R3 splits class/closure planning from body emission and makes every hidden
support unit visible to `PreparedIrProgram`.

## Exhaustive source-unit census

Before preparing any body, walk the source once in lexical/source order and
record one `IrUnitId` per executable source body. The census must distinguish:

1. Top-level and nested function declarations, including last-wins/Annex-B
   declarations without losing shadowed identities.
2. Function expressions, arrows, IIFEs, callback expressions, object-literal
   methods/getters/setters, and computed/private method bodies.
3. Class declarations and expressions at module, function, block, loop,
   switch, try/catch/finally, and expression positions.
4. Explicit constructors, synthesized default base/derived constructors,
   instance/static methods, and instance/static getter/setter pairs.
5. Instance field initializer expressions and parameter-property/default work;
   static field/block execution is inventoried here but its ordered
   `ModuleInitPlan` emission belongs to #3523.
6. Lifted closure bodies and nested functions produced from each parent.

Unsupported or ambient/abstract bodies are not omitted. Ambient/abstract
entries receive an explicit non-executable classification; executable but
unimplemented entries receive typed Unsupported. Inventory must equal terminal
outcomes before class/body emission.

## Source units versus support units

Do not equate generated Wasm functions with source bodies. Record explicit
support relationships:

- A source constructor is one source unit. For a WasmGC class,
  `<Class>_new` is an allocation wrapper and `<Class>_init` is the support unit
  that executes field/default/source-constructor semantics. The source body
  must occur in exactly one of them, never both.
- A default constructor receives a deterministic synthetic source-unit ID and
  support units derived from its `IrClassId`.
- Inherited member aliases point to a canonical parent unit/slot and are not a
  second body emission.
- Closure trampolines, wrapper structs, cache globals, host bridges, and
  method-call adapters are support units/bindings derived from the source unit.
  Their own emissions are counted, but they do not inflate the source-body
  denominator.
- Runtime provider bodies (Promise subclass bridges, coercion helpers, string/
  object/array providers) remain shared support code until R6. R3 plans typed
  calls to them; it does not copy or delete them.

## Preparation and ownership rules

1. Build class layouts, parent relationships, member signatures, field plans,
   descriptors, closure captures, and support intents into `ProgramAbiMap` /
   `PreparedIrProgram` before any class or closure body emitter runs.
2. Prepare a class ownership component atomically when its layouts,
   constructor/init chain, members, field initializers, nested closures, or
   inheritance edges cannot safely cross policies. One unsupported member may
   temporarily make the whole component direct, but that decision and every
   per-unit outcome are final before emission.
3. Prepared source bodies use only IR emission and planned support units.
   Unsupported components use the direct path once. No legacy class body is
   retained behind an IR patch.
4. A lifted/nested function failure is part of its parent component's typed
   preparation result. It cannot be discovered after the parent body shipped.
5. Replace the current selector/integration static mismatch with exhaustive
   reconciliation: `selected IDs == prepared IDs + typed failures`. A `continue`
   that drops a selected unit is an Invariant.
6. Preserve class evaluation and static initializer intents for #3523. R3
   plans their identities/layouts but does not reorder top-level execution.

## Bounded landing sequence

### Commit 1 — exhaustive census and class/closure ABI planning

- Add the source-unit walker and source/support-unit distinction.
- Move the planning half of `collectClassDeclaration` into typed class/layout/
  ABI data without compiling bodies.
- Inventory all nested/class-expression/object-method/closure positions and
  reconcile them with R0 outcomes.

### Commit 2 — Prepared class members and constructor support

- Prepare constructors, `_new`/`_init`, methods, getters/setters, fields,
  inheritance, and `super` call components.
- Implement static method/accessor signatures without `self`; close the
  selector-static/integration-skip hole.
- IR-emit Prepared components once; direct-emit Unsupported components once.

### Commit 3 — closures, nested units, and legacy-body bypass

- Prepare lifted functions, closure captures, object methods, and nested class
  units before emission.
- Route closure support through planned ABI bindings and exact counters.
- Bypass `compileClassBodies` / nested direct body compilation for every
  Prepared unit. Leave the direct implementation present for temporary
  Unsupported policy and R10 deletion.

## File ownership and locks

One developer owns `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts`,
`src/codegen/declarations.ts`, `src/codegen/closures.ts`, `src/ir/select.ts`,
`src/ir/from-ast.ts`, `src/ir/integration.ts`, and the Prepared-program modules
for the R3 landing. These files encode one class/closure component invariant
and must not be split between parallel implementation branches.

`src/ir/module-init.ts` and module-init/start wiring are reserved for #3523.
Runtime/builtin provider files are reserved for R6. Multi-source and linear
files remain R5/R8.

## Anti-vacuity tests

`tests/issue-3522-ir-class-compile-once.test.ts` must prove:

1. An explicit base constructor, synthesized default constructor, and derived
   constructor inventory one source body each. `_new` and `_init` are distinct
   support units; constructor/field code executes once and counters reconcile.
2. Instance/static methods with the same property name, instance/static
   getters/setters, and a top-level synthetic-key collision receive distinct
   IDs, slots, and correct receiver signatures.
3. A static method admitted by selection is Prepared and emitted; a test seam
   that restores the current integration `continue` fails reconciliation.
4. Fields, parameter defaults, `super(...)`, `super.method()`, overrides,
   inherited aliases, and multi-level local inheritance run like JavaScript on
   host, standalone, and WASI-relevant configurations.
5. Named/anonymous class expressions and class declarations nested in a
   function/block/loop/try inventory deterministically and capture the correct
   enclosing binding.
6. Function declarations, expressions, arrows, object methods/accessors,
   IIFEs, and lifted closures record one source outcome and one body emitter.
   A lifted build/verify failure is terminal before any parent body emission.
7. A Prepared class component has `direct=0, IR=1` for every source body. An
   Unsupported component has `direct=1, IR=0`; no unit has both or neither.
8. Static field/block intents are present in source order for #3523 but are not
   executed by a second R3 path.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The single-source inventory is exhaustive for every executable function,
      class/member, field-initializer, object-method, nested, and closure body;
      inventory equals terminal outcomes before emission.
- [ ] Source units and synthetic support units have distinct structural IDs and
      counters. No constructor or inherited alias double-counts a source body.
- [ ] Constructors, `_new`/`_init`, instance/static methods, get/set, fields,
      inheritance, class expressions, nested declarations, object methods, and
      closures follow the Prepared-or-Unsupported compile-once rule.
- [ ] There is no selector-static/integration-skip hole and no selected unit can
      disappear through a `continue` or flat-name collision.
- [ ] Prepared class/closure bodies do not call legacy body compilers or patch
      legacy-created slots. Unsupported units remain one-pass direct only under
      the temporary hybrid policy.
- [ ] Class layouts/type indices/signatures and capture ABI are fully planned
      before bodies; late unplanned support is fatal.
- [ ] Runtime provider implementations remain shared and present for R6; R3
      deletes no behavior merely because a class body is IR-owned.
- [ ] Runtime/equivalence, cross-backend, standalone/WASI validity, full class/
      closure tests, and merge-group Test262 are net-non-negative.

## Risks and mitigations

- **Incomplete nested census:** class expressions, object methods, or lifted
  closures can remain invisible while common class tests pass. Reconcile the
  exhaustive source walk against terminal outcomes and add omission seams.
- **Constructor/support double execution:** `_new`, `_init`, field work, and
  the source constructor can overlap. Model one source unit with explicit
  support edges and assert source-body and support-emitter counts separately.
- **Class ABI/layout drift:** receiver signatures, inheritance, and type-index
  order are validation-sensitive. Freeze the entire class component in
  `ProgramAbiMap` and test legacy/IR boundary calls before emitting it.
- **Evaluation-order leakage into R4:** collecting static intents can execute or
  reorder them too early. R3 records immutable source ordinals only; #3523 is
  the sole owner of their execution.
- **Runtime-provider scope creep:** class/closure support may call shared
  runtime families. Record typed intents and retain providers for R6 instead of
  copying or deleting behavior in R3.

## Out of scope

- Ordered module-init execution, static field/block emission, live-binding
  seeds, TDZ/export/start/defer/WASI init policy (#3523).
- Cross-file/multi-source Prepared ownership (R5).
- Replacing runtime provider entry points with semantic intrinsics (R6).
- Async class/method/closure ownership beyond R7's policy, shared linear
  consumption (R8), escape-hatch removal (R9), or direct-handler deletion
  (#3090/R10).

The PR report must include the exhaustive source/support-unit census by kind,
class-component ownership decisions, the static-claim reconciliation table,
per-unit direct/IR emission counters, and runtime evidence for every listed
class/closure family. A green class sample with missing nested/static IDs is
vacuous and does not close R3.
