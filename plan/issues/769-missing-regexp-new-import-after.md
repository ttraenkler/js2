# #769 -- Missing RegExp_new import after lib.d.ts refactoring (~600 CE)

## Problem

After commit 856ed814 (#740) changed lib.d.ts loading to read from the TypeScript package at runtime, `getSourceFile("lib.d.ts")` returns `undefined` because TypeScript now loads individual lib files (lib.es5.d.ts, lib.es2015.d.ts, etc.). This meant `collectExternDeclarations` never ran on lib files, so RegExp (and Date, Map, Set, etc.) were never registered as extern classes.

## Implementation Summary

**What was done:** Changed both the single-file and multi-file compilation paths to iterate all program source files and match lib files by checking `baseName.startsWith("lib.") && baseName.endsWith(".d.ts")`.

**Files changed:** `src/codegen/index.ts`

**What worked:** The fix was already applied on main as part of the uncommitted working tree changes from the #740 refactoring.
