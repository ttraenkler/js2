# #2989 — standalone defineProperty missing spec TypeErrors

## Problem

Follow-up from #2965. ~32 tests assert that `defineProperty` (or an operation
gated by it) throws a `TypeError` in a spec-mandated case, but the standalone
lane does not throw:

- defining/growing an array `length` past a non-writable barrier,
- defining a new property on a non-extensible object,
- redefining a non-configurable property with an incompatible descriptor.

These are missing-throw failures (the operation silently succeeds or no-ops
instead of throwing). Note the payload opacity itself is #2962's scope; here the
issue is the _absence_ of the throw, not its stringifiability.

## Acceptance

- The three spec-mandated TypeError sites throw on the standalone lane; measured
  flip count on the standalone defineProperty throw-assertion subset with zero
  regressions; gc/host byte-inert.
