# #567 — Wasm validation: struct.get on null ref type (860 CE)

## Status: in-review
860 tests fail Wasm validation with "struct.get[0] expected type (ref null N), found ref.null" — the compiler accesses struct fields on a bare `ref.null` instead of a properly typed nullable ref.

This is the #1 Wasm validation error. The compiler needs to ensure all struct field accesses have properly typed references, even when the value could be null.

## Complexity: M

## Implementation Summary

### What was done

Three fixes to ensure null values are properly typed when used in struct reference contexts:

1. **Fast-path in `compileExpression`** (expressions.ts): When `null`, `undefined`, or omitted expressions are compiled with an expected type of `ref_null` or `ref`, emit `ref.null $typeIdx` (with the correct struct type index) instead of the generic `ref.null.extern`. This directly prevents the type mismatch at the source.

2. **Coercion path `externref -> ref/ref_null`** (expressions.ts, in `coerceType`): Added a new coercion case for when an externref value needs to become a GC struct ref. Uses `any.convert_extern` + `ref.cast_null` (nullable) or `ref.cast` (non-nullable). This handles cases where the fast-path doesn't trigger (e.g., ternary expressions, function calls that return externref but are stored in struct-typed locals).

3. **Bare `return;` with ref_null return type** (statements.ts): The bare return statement handler was missing cases for `ref_null`, `ref`, and `i64` return types. Added proper default value emission for these types.

4. **Added `ref.cast_null` instruction support**: Added binary encoding (using `GC.ref_cast_null` opcode 0x17), WAT emission, object emission, and dead-elimination tracking for the new `ref.cast_null` instruction.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — fast-path for null in struct ref context; externref->ref coercion
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — bare return handling for ref_null/ref/i64 types
- `src/emit/binary.ts` — ref.cast_null binary encoding
- `src/emit/wat.ts` — ref.cast_null WAT emission
- `src/emit/object.ts` — ref.cast_null object emission
- `src/codegen/dead-elimination.ts` — ref.cast_null type tracking
- `tests/struct-null-ref.test.ts` — 5 new test cases

### What worked
- The fast-path approach catches most cases at compile time, avoiding runtime overhead
- The coercion fallback handles edge cases where type hints are not available

### Tests now passing
- 5 new tests covering: null-to-struct assignment, null function returns, null-then-reassign patterns, nullable arrays
