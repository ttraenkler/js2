# #883 -- Deploy playground + dashboard to GitHub Pages

## Problem

The playground and sprint dashboard only run locally. For the STF funding application, we need a public demo.

## Requirements

1. Build playground for static hosting (Vite build already works)
2. Include dashboard at /dashboard route
3. GitHub Actions workflow: build + deploy to GitHub Pages on push to main
4. Pre-generate dashboard data (node dashboard/build-data.js) during build
5. Test262 results page with conformance trend chart accessible publicly

## Acceptance criteria

- Playground accessible at https://loopdive.github.io/js2wasm/
- Dashboard at https://loopdive.github.io/js2wasm/dashboard/
- Auto-deploys on push to main

## Implementation Summary

The GitHub Pages deployment infrastructure was already in place. Fixes applied:

1. **Vite build fix**: Externalized `binaryen` in `playground/vite.config.ts` rollup config — the dynamic import was causing build failures
2. **Base path fix**: Changed `href="/"` to `href="./"` in landing page nav logo — absolute paths don't work on GitHub Pages subdirectory (`/js2wasm/`)
3. **Dashboard data regenerated**: Updated `dashboard/data.js` with current issue/sprint state

### Build pipeline (already working)
- `pnpm build:pages` chains: `dashboard/build-data.js` → `build:playground` → `scripts/build-pages.js`
- Output: `pages-dist/` with landing page, playground, dashboard, conformance report, trend chart, issues graph
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` runs on push to main, uploads `pages-dist` as Pages artifact

### Pages structure
- `/` — landing page
- `/playground/` — interactive compiler playground
- `/dashboard/` — sprint dashboard with pre-generated data
- `/benchmarks/report.html` — conformance report (categories, feature breakdown, test source viewer)
- `/benchmarks/results/report.html` — historical trend chart
- `/issues-graph.html` — dependency graph
- `/wasm-treemap.html` — Wasm module size treemap
