# Issue #259: ClassDeclaration in block/nested scope positions

## Status: done

## Summary
~85 tests fail with just "Unsupported statement: ClassDeclaration". These are class declarations inside blocks (if/else, try/catch, loops) or other nested positions that the codegen currently rejects. The compiler should hoist these class declarations or handle them as block-scoped bindings.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group B

## Complexity: M

## Scope
- Support `class Foo {}` inside block statements (if, for, try, etc.)
- Treat block-scoped class declarations as local bindings
- Update `compileStatement` in `src/codegen/statements.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Class declarations in block scope compile
- At least 30 compile errors resolved

## Implementation notes
The implementation already existed in `src/codegen/statements.ts` via `compileNestedClassDeclaration()`,
which is called from `compileStatement` when it encounters a `ClassDeclaration` AST node. The function:

1. Checks if the class was already collected (via `ctx.structMap`)
2. Calls `collectClassDeclaration(ctx, decl)` to register the struct type, constructor, and method stubs
3. Builds a `funcByName` map from the module's functions
4. Calls `compileClassBodies(ctx, decl, funcByName)` to compile constructor and method bodies

Tests added in `tests/issue-259.test.ts` covering:
- Class inside if block
- Class inside else block
- Class inside bare block
- Class with multiple methods inside block
