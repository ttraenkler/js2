# #464 — Array bounds check elimination for loops with known bounds

For-loops like `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) arr[i]` emit redundant bounds checks on every `array.get`. When the loop guard guarantees `i < length`, the bounds check can be elided. Improves hot loop performance (e.g., scheduler sift operations).

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added bounds check elimination for array element accesses inside for-loops where the loop condition guarantees the index is within bounds.

### Approach
1. **FunctionContext extension** (`src/codegen/index.ts`): Added optional `safeIndexedArrays?: Set<string>` field to track array-index pairs where bounds are guaranteed safe.

2. **Pattern detection** (`src/codegen/statements.ts`): In `compileForStatement`, before compiling the loop body, the condition is analyzed for patterns like:
   - `i < arr.length` (LessThan with identifier and .length property access)
   - `arr.length > i` (GreaterThan reversed)
   - Also handles `<=` and `>=` variants
   
   When detected, the pair `"arrayVar:indexVar"` is added to `fctx.safeIndexedArrays`. The set is scoped to the loop body and restored after.

3. **Bounds check elision** (`src/codegen/expressions.ts`): Added `isSafeBoundsEliminated()` helper that checks if an `ElementAccessExpression` matches a safe pair. At both array.get call sites in `compileElementAccessBody` (vec struct case and raw array case), when the pattern matches, a direct `array.get` is emitted instead of the full `emitBoundsCheckedArrayGet` with its if/else branching.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — Added `safeIndexedArrays` field to `FunctionContext` interface
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — Added pattern detection in `compileForStatement`
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — Added `isSafeBoundsEliminated()` helper and conditional elision at two call sites
- `tests/equivalence/array-bounds-elimination.test.ts` — 6 new tests (all passing)

### Tests now passing
- Basic sum with `i < arr.length` pattern
- String array iteration
- Nested for-loops with bounds elimination
- Non-pattern for-loops still work (falls back to bounds checking)
- Reversed comparison `arr.length > i`
- Empty array edge case (loop never executes, no trap)
