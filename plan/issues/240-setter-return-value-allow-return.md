# Issue #240: Setter return value -- allow return in setter bodies

## Status: done

## Summary

55 tests fail with "Setters cannot return a value" errors. TypeScript reports this as a diagnostic error, but in JavaScript (and test262), setters are allowed to have return statements -- the return value is simply ignored by the caller.

## Root Cause

TypeScript's checker emits a diagnostic when a setter body contains a return statement with a value. In allowJs mode, this should be suppressed since it is valid JS. The codegen should simply compile the setter body normally and discard any return value.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- TypeScript diagnostic filtering
- Tests affected: ~55 compile errors

## Expected Impact

Fixes ~55 compile errors. Many of these tests also have other errors (ClassDeclaration, unsupported call), so net new passing tests may be ~20-30.

## Suggested Approach

1. Add TS diagnostic code for "Setters cannot return a value" to the suppression list in allowJs mode
2. In the setter codegen, if a return statement with a value is encountered, compile the expression (for side effects) but do not emit the return value
3. This is a minimal, low-risk fix

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Setter bodies with return statements compile without error in allowJs mode
- [ ] Return values in setters are discarded (not returned to caller)
- [ ] At least 30 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Notes

TS diagnostic code 2408 ("Setters cannot return a value") was already in the `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` set in `src/compiler.ts` from a prior sprint. The codegen handles setter bodies normally -- any return value is compiled for side effects but discarded. Equivalence test added to verify setter compilation works end-to-end.

## Complexity: XS
