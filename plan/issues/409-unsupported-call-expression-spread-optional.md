# #409 -- Unsupported call expression: spread, optional chaining, super, property methods

## Status: ready

1,752 tests fail with "Unsupported call expression". This is the single largest compile error category. Previous work in #387 reduced the count from 2,356 but significant patterns remain.

## Root cause

`compileCallExpression` in expressions.ts does not handle several call patterns:
- **Spread arguments**: `fn(...args)`, `fn(a, ...rest)`
- **Optional chaining calls**: `obj?.method()`, `fn?.()`
- **Super calls in derived constructors**: `super(args)` in complex positions
- **Property method calls**: `obj.method()` where obj is a computed/dynamic expression

## Example failures

- `test/language/expressions/addition/S11.6.1_A2.2_T3.js` -- spread in addition context
- `test/language/expressions/call/11.2.3-3_1.js` -- call expression edge case
- `test/language/expressions/call/spread-obj-symbol.js` -- spread with symbol keys

## Relationship to prior work

#387 (done) addressed the initial bulk of unsupported call expressions but focused on method calls on object literals and returned values. This issue covers the remaining 1,652 cases which involve more complex patterns.

## Complexity: L

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Spread arguments in function calls compile correctly
- [x] Optional chaining calls (`?.()`) compile or gracefully degrade
- [ ] Super calls in all positions compile
- [ ] Property method calls on dynamic expressions compile
- [ ] CE count for "Unsupported call expression" reduced by at least 50%

## Implementation Notes

### What was done
Expanded `compileOptionalCallExpression` to handle all receiver types, not just external declared classes:
1. **Local class instance methods** -- resolves via `classSet`, walks `classParentMap` for inherited methods, uses `ref.as_non_null` for ref_null receivers
2. **Struct type methods** -- resolves via `resolveStructName`, handles object literals with methods
3. **String methods** -- both native (fast mode) and import-based string method resolution
4. **Number methods** -- toString, toFixed
5. **Array methods** -- delegates to `compileArrayMethodCall`

Also added `compileOptionalDirectCall` for the `fn?.()` pattern (identifier callee with questionDotToken), supporting both closures (call_ref) and direct function calls.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- rewrote `compileOptionalCallExpression`, added `compileOptionalDirectCall`
- `tests/equivalence/optional-chaining-call.test.ts` -- 5 new equivalence tests

### Tests now passing
- obj?.method() on non-null local class instance
- obj?.method() on null local class instance
- obj?.method() with arguments (both null and non-null)
- optional chaining on inherited method
