# Issue #373: Object as loop condition / falsy value handling

## Problem
12 test262 tests were being skipped due to overly conservative skip filters in `tests/test262-runner.ts`. The filters blocked:
- `while(NaN)`, `while(undefined)`, `while(null)` -- assumed these would cause infinite loops
- `for(;NaN;)`, `for(;undefined;)`, `for(;null;)` -- same concern
- `while({...})`, `while(function...)` -- assumed object/function refs would always be truthy

## Root Cause
The skip filters were added when the codegen used `f64.ne(0)` for f64 conditions, which incorrectly treats NaN as truthy. However, the codegen was subsequently fixed:
- `ensureI32Condition` in `src/codegen/index.ts` now uses `f64.abs` + `f64.gt(0)` for f64, which correctly treats NaN, +0, and -0 as falsy
- `undefined`/`null` compile to `ref.null.extern` (externref), and `ensureI32Condition` correctly treats null refs as falsy via `ref.is_null`
- Object/function refs are non-null and correctly treated as truthy

The skip filters were no longer needed.

## Implementation Summary
- Removed 3 skip filters from `tests/test262-runner.ts` (lines 161-173) and replaced with a comment documenting why they are no longer needed
- Added `tests/equivalence/loop-condition-falsy.test.ts` with 10 test cases covering:
  - `while(NaN)`, `while(undefined)`, `while(null)`, `while(0)` -- all falsy, should not enter loop
  - `for(;NaN;)` -- falsy, should not enter loop
  - Object variable in while condition -- truthy, should enter loop
  - `while(1)`, `while(Infinity)` -- truthy, should enter loop
  - `while(-0)` -- falsy (negative zero), should not enter loop
  - NaN variable in for loop condition -- falsy

### Files Changed
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` -- removed skip filters
- `tests/equivalence/loop-condition-falsy.test.ts` -- new test file (10 tests, all passing)
