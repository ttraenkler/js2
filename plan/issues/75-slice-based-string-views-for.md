# Issue 75: Slice-based string views for substring/trim/slice

## Summary

Change the NativeString representation from `(len, data)` to
`(offset, len, data)` so that `substring`, `slice`, `trim`, `trimStart`, and
`trimEnd` return views into the original backing array instead of copying.

## Motivation

Benchmark #73 shows substring is 39x slower than JS and trim is 3.8x slower.
The root cause: every substring/trim allocates a new `(array (mut i16))` and
copies characters. V8's `substring` returns a SlicedString — a pointer into the
original string's memory — making it O(1).

With a `(offset, len, data)` representation, substring becomes:
```wasm
;; substring(s, start, end) → new struct with same backing array
(struct.new $NativeString
  (i32.add (struct.get $NativeString $offset (local.get $s)) (local.get $start))
  (i32.sub (local.get $end) (local.get $start))
  (struct.get $NativeString $data (local.get $s)))
```
Three `struct.get`/`i32` ops — no allocation, no copy.

## Design

### New NativeString layout

```
Current:  (struct (field $len i32) (field $data (ref (array (mut i16)))))
Proposed: (struct (field $off i32) (field $len i32) (field $data (ref (array (mut i16)))))
```

### Operations affected

| Operation | Current | With views |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| substring/slice | O(n) copy | O(1) struct.new |
| trim/trimStart/trimEnd | O(n) copy | O(1) offset adjustment |
| charAt | `array.get data[i]` | `array.get data[off + i]` |
| indexOf/includes | loop from 0..len | loop from off..off+len |
| concat | copy both into new array | unchanged (must copy) |
| string literal init | off=0, len=data.len | off=0, len=data.len |
| equals | compare 0..len | compare off..off+len |

### Impact on existing helpers

Every helper that reads from the backing array currently uses index `i` directly.
With views, all reads become `off + i`. This is a one-line change per loop but
touches every string helper function.

### Memory implications

Views keep the original backing array alive. A 1MB string's 3-char substring
retains the full 1MB backing array. This matches V8's behavior (V8 flattens
SlicedStrings under memory pressure). For now, accept this trade-off — the
performance gain far outweighs the memory cost for typical usage.

## Complexity

M — Changes the core string struct layout (one field added), updates all string
helper emitters (~15 functions) to use `off + i` indexing, and updates string
literal initialization. No new algorithms.

## Dependencies

| Issue | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **#71** | Native strings — this optimizes the #71 implementation |
| **#73** | Benchmarks — measure the speedup |

## Expected benchmark impact

- **substring**: 39x slower → ~1x (O(1) vs O(1))
- **trim**: 3.8x slower → ~1x (O(whitespace-scan) but no copy)
- **indexOf/includes**: small regression from `off + i` addition (negligible)
- **concat**: unchanged
