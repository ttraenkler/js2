# #733 -- RangeError validation in built-ins (442 tests)

## Status: in-review
## Problem

442 tests expect `RangeError` to be thrown but the compiler does not throw one. Common cases:
- `toFixed()`/`toPrecision()`/`toExponential()` with out-of-range arguments
- Array constructor with negative length
- `String.prototype.repeat()` with negative/Infinity count
- `String.prototype.normalize()` with invalid form
- Stack overflow (maximum call stack exceeded)

### What needs to happen

1. Sample the failing tests to identify the top RangeError patterns
2. Add range validation checks before the relevant built-in operations
3. Emit `throw new RangeError(...)` when validation fails

## Implementation Notes

### Key discovery: lib type resolution gap

The TypeScript type checker does not resolve `ArrayBuffer`, `DataView`, etc. to their
known types because `className` comes from `type.getSymbol()?.name` which returns
`undefined` when the type resolves to `any` (flags: 1). This means the inline codegen
paths for `className === "ArrayBuffer"` and `className === "DataView"` (around line
16098/16149) are dead code. The constructors go through the `!className` fallback
path which produces `ref.null.extern`.

### Changes made

1. **`!className` fallback path in `compileNewExpression`** (src/codegen/expressions.ts):
   Added RangeError validation before the constructor import call for:
   - `new ArrayBuffer(byteLength)` -- validates non-negative integer length
   - `new DataView(buffer, byteOffset, byteLength)` -- validates non-negative integer offset and length
   - `new Array(n)` -- validates non-negative integer length < 2^32

2. **toString radix NaN check** (both property access and element access paths):
   Added `floor()` + NaN check (`val != val`) to the radix validation for
   `Number.prototype.toString(radix)`. Previously NaN passed through because
   `f64.lt/f64.gt` return false for NaN operands.

3. **toPrecision NaN check** (both paths):
   Added NaN check for `Number.prototype.toPrecision(precision)`. NaN converts
   to 0 via ToIntegerOrInfinity, and 0 < 1, so it should throw RangeError.

4. **className === "ArrayBuffer"/"DataView" paths** (dead code):
   Updated with validation for future use when lib type resolution is fixed.

### Tests added
- `tests/issue-733.test.ts` -- 8 tests covering ArrayBuffer, DataView, Array constructor
  validation and toPrecision(NaN).

### Remaining gaps (not addressed)
- DataView get/set method boundary checks (86 tests) -- requires DataView method codegen
- `[].length = invalidValue` (36 tests) -- requires array length setter validation
- Object.defineProperties with invalid array length (35 tests)
- NativeError prototype chain (14 tests) -- requires error object modeling
- Date.prototype.toISOString on invalid dates (9 tests)
