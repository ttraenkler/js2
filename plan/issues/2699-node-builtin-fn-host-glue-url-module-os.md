# #2699 — node:url / node:module / node:os destructured-import host-glue

## Problem (verify-first findings)

Real-eslint-runs need the Node builtins eslint/lib imports. Verified on current
`main`:

- The **namespace** form already works in a JS host: `const os = require("node:os");
  os.platform()` → "linux", `const fs = require("node:fs"); fs.existsSync(p)` →
  true. The `node_builtin` runtime resolver (`src/runtime.ts:11981`) already does
  `require(modName)` and member dispatch flows through `__extern_get`. No new
  runtime shim is needed for the namespace form.
- The **destructured / named** form was BROKEN: `const { pathToFileURL } =
  require("node:url")` (eslint's actual form — cli.js, config-loader.js, eslint.js)
  generated **no host import** — `pathToFileURL` fell through to a generic `env`
  stub and resolved to `undefined`. eslint imports node builtins destructured:
  `{ pathToFileURL }`, `{ createRequire }`, `{ isMainThread, threadId }`, etc.

The working mechanism for named/destructured function imports is the existing
`__nodefn__<module>__<fn>` typed-stub path (`NODE_BUILTIN_FN_TYPED_STUBS` →
`node_builtin_fn` ImportIntent → `require(module)[fn]` host adapter), already used
by `node:crypto` (#1491/#1492). The gap was simply that url/module/os had no
entries (and `node:module` was not even in `NODE_BUILTIN_MODULES`).

## Fix (pure data — runtime route already exists)

`src/import-resolver.ts`:
- Added `node:module` to `NODE_BUILTIN_MODULES`.
- Added `NODE_BUILTIN_FN_TYPED_STUBS` entries for the eslint function surface:
  - `url`: `pathToFileURL`, `fileURLToPath`
  - `module`: `createRequire`
  - `os`: `platform`, `release`

## Verified

`const { pathToFileURL, fileURLToPath } = require("node:url")` → routes to
`__nodefn__url__pathToFileURL` / `__nodefn__url__fileURLToPath`:
- `pathToFileURL("/tmp/x.js").href` → "file:///tmp/x.js"
- `fileURLToPath("file:///tmp/x.js")` → "/tmp/x.js"
- `os.platform()` → "linux", `os.release()` → "6.12.76-linuxkit"
- `createRequire("/tmp/x.js")` → a function

`tests/issue-2699.test.ts` covers classification + round-trips with the real
modules injected via `buildImports(..., deps)`.

## Deferred follow-ups

- **`node:fs/promises`** — the `/` in the module name breaks the
  `__nodefn__<module>__<fn>` identifier scheme (would emit an invalid
  `__nodefn__fs/promises__readFile` declaration). Needs slash-sanitisation
  coordinated across the import-manifest classifier + runtime resolver. eslint's
  `fs/promises` use is in the CLI/config layers, not the Linter.verify hot path.
- **`node:worker_threads`** — `Worker`/`parentPort`/`isMainThread` are
  value/class-shaped, not functions, so the function-stub pattern doesn't fit;
  CLI-only (not eslint/lib), deferred.
- **`node:url` `URL` class** (a global + class) and **`node:util`
  styleText/stripVTControlCharacters** — separate shapes/efforts.
- Standalone (`--target wasi`) host-glue is out of scope (these route to the JS
  host `require`); dual-mode for these is a follow-up.
