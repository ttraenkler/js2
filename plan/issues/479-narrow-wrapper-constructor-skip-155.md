# #479 — Narrow wrapper constructor skip (155 tests)

155 tests still skipped for "uses wrapper constructor". Issue #344 made wrapper constructors return primitives, but the skip filter may still be catching some tests. Check if the filter is stale or if these tests genuinely need typeof === "object" behavior.
