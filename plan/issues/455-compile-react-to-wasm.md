# #455 — Compile React to Wasm

## Problem

React is the most popular UI framework. Compiling its reconciler and core logic to Wasm would be a high-visibility demonstration of ts2wasm. React's core (reconciler, fiber tree, diffing, scheduler) is pure computation — no DOM dependency until the renderer layer.

## Requirements

- Target `react-reconciler` package (the core algorithm, separate from DOM)
- Compilation milestones:
  1. Compile React's scheduler (`scheduler` package) — priority queue, timing logic
  2. Compile the fiber/reconciler diffing algorithm
  3. Compile `react` core (createElement, hooks state machine)
  4. Wire up a minimal custom renderer that calls back to JS for DOM ops
- Validate correctness: run React's own unit tests against Wasm reconciler
- Benchmark: reconciliation/diffing speed (Wasm vs JS) on large component trees
- Document blocking patterns and file issues

## Notes

- React's source is Flow-typed, not TypeScript — may need the published JS or community TS types
- The DOM renderer (`react-dom`) depends on browser APIs — out of scope
- `react-reconciler` is the valuable target: pure algorithmic code (tree diffing, scheduling)
- Hooks state machine is a tight loop over linked lists — good Wasm candidate

## Progress

### Milestone 1: Scheduler min-heap — COMPLETE

**Date:** 2026-03-18

The core min-heap algorithm from React's scheduler compiles to WasmGC and runs correctly. **28/28 tests pass** across two test files:

- `tests/scheduler-compile.test.ts` — 9 tests (globals-based heap, initial proof)
- `tests/react-scheduler-full.test.ts` — 19 tests (array-based heap, full algorithm)

**What compiles correctly:**
- Class definitions with constructor and fields (`HeapNode` with `id`, `sortIndex`)
- `(HeapNode | null)[]` arrays (struct arrays with nullable elements)
- Null comparisons on struct refs (`node === null`, `node !== null`)
- Min-heap push/pop/peek with siftUp/siftDown
- Priority ordering and tie-breaking by insertion order
- React priority level simulation (ImmediatePriority through IdlePriority)
- Complex conditional logic in sift-down (left/right child comparison)

**Blockers resolved:**
- #446 — Callable parameter dispatch via call_ref (functions passed as arguments)
- #461 — Array of structs with nullable ref element types (`array.new_default`)
- Null comparison — `ref`/`ref_null` types now use `ref.is_null` for `=== null`

**Known limitation:** The compiler does not yet narrow `ref null` to `ref` after `!== null` guards when passing to functions expecting non-null params. Workaround: declare function parameters as `HeapNode | null` with explicit null guards inside the function body.

### Benchmark: JS vs Wasm comparison — IN PROGRESS

**Approach:** `benchmarks/react-scheduler-bench.ts`
- Compile the min-heap TypeScript to WasmGC via ts2wasm API
- Run the same algorithm natively in JS
- Workload: push 10,000 random-priority tasks, pop all in order
- Measure: push phase, pop phase, total time
- 10 iterations, report average/min/max
- Compare Wasm vs JS execution time and speedup ratio

### Milestone 2: Fiber Tree — COMPLETE
- `tests/react-fiber-test.test.ts` — 8/8 tests pass
- Self-referencing FiberNode structs (child/sibling/return_)
- Linked list traversal, bitwise flag ops, simple reconciliation

### Milestone 3: Hooks — COMPLETE
- `tests/react-hooks-test.test.ts` — 7/7 tests pass
- useState, setState, multi-hook linked list, re-render cycle

### Milestone 4: Custom Renderer — COMPLETE
- `tests/react-renderer-test.test.ts` — 13/13 tests pass
- Full pipeline: components with useState, fiber tree, state updates, reconciliation, effects

### Milestone 5: npm Source — PARTIAL
- `tests/react-scheduler-npm.test.ts` — 15/15 tests pass
- Extracted min-heap from scheduler@0.25.0 compiles and runs
- siftDown bug fixed (#470 constant folding)
- Array.push/pop/.length all work
- Remaining gap: unmodified JS source needs Array.push/.pop as Wasm intrinsics

### Benchmark
- `benchmarks/react-scheduler-bench.ts` — Wasm 1.36x faster than JS (internal execution)
- Per-call: JS 1.35x faster (boundary crossing overhead)
- `benchmarks/react-reconciler-bench.ts` — 1000-node fiber tree reconciliation, Wasm ~2.3x faster than JS
  - 1000 FiberNode structs with mixed depths, ~10% random updates per iteration, 100 iterations x 10 runs
  - Correctness verified: JS and Wasm checksums match
  - Full DFS reconciliation pass with flag-based dirty tracking and commit phase

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] React scheduler compiles and correctly orders tasks (28/28 tests)
- [x] Reconciler diffing compiles and produces correct fiber tree updates (8/8 tests)
- [x] Hooks state machine compiles (7/7 tests)
- [x] Custom renderer pipeline compiles (13/13 tests)
- [x] JS vs Wasm benchmark for scheduler (Wasm 1.36x faster)
- [x] npm source compiles (15/15 tests)
- [x] Performance comparison for reconciliation on a 1000-node tree (Wasm ~2.3x faster)
