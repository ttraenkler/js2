# #352 -- Delete operator

## Status: open

264 tests use the delete operator. For WasmGC structs, deletion could be simulated by setting fields to undefined/null sentinel values.

## Details

The `delete` operator removes a property from an object:
```javascript
var obj = {x: 1, y: 2};
delete obj.x;
obj.x === undefined;  // true
"x" in obj;           // false
```

For WasmGC structs, true deletion is impossible (struct fields are fixed at compile time). Options:

1. **Sentinel values**: Set deleted fields to a special sentinel (e.g., ref.null). `hasOwnProperty` and `in` check for the sentinel.
2. **Bitmask**: Add a deletion bitmask field to structs. Each bit tracks whether a field is "deleted".
3. **Return true for non-configurable**: Many test262 delete tests just check that `delete` returns the correct boolean. For non-configurable properties, return false; for others, return true.

For variables: `delete x` in non-strict mode returns false (variables are not deletable). In strict mode, it is a SyntaxError.

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `delete obj.prop` sets the field to sentinel and returns true
- [ ] `"prop" in obj` returns false after deletion
- [ ] `delete variable` returns false
- [ ] 264 previously skipped tests are now attempted
