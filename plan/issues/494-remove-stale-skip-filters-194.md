# #494 — Remove stale skip filters (194 tests)

## Status: open

Several skip filters are stale — the features they guard were already implemented:

| Filter | Tests | Already done? |
|--------|------:|--------------|
| Object.keys/values/entries | 102 | #61 implemented these |
| new Object() | 92 | #181 implemented this |
| globalThis | 22 | Should compile as module global |
| for-of object destructuring from array | 64 | Likely works now |

## Approach

Remove or narrow each filter one at a time, run the affected tests, file issues for any new failures.

## Complexity: XS

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Stale filters removed
- [ ] New pass count measured
- [ ] Follow-up issues created for remaining failures
