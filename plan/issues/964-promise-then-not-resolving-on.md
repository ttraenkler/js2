# #964 — Promise .then() not resolving on all Promise types

## Problem

531 tests fail with "p.then is not a function" after #961 re-added Promise instance methods via late imports. The late import mechanism works for some Promise patterns but not all.

## Error pattern

`p.then is not a function` — the Promise receiver doesn't expose .then() through the externref interface.

## Likely Cause

#961 re-added Promise_then/catch/finally as late imports during codegen. But:
1. The import may not be registered for all code paths that produce Promise values
2. The receiver type may not be recognized as Promise in all cases (e.g. async generator yield results, Promise.allSettled results)
3. The `__extern_method_call` fallback doesn't handle .then()

## Depends on #963

Some of these 531 may actually be runner false positives from state leak. Fix #963 first, re-run, then see how many remain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- .then()/.catch()/.finally() work on all Promise-typed expressions
- No "then is not a function" regressions vs sprint 37 baseline
