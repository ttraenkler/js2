# #918 -- Create a curated batch of contributor-friendly starter issues with exact file ownership and acceptance criteria

## Problem

The project has many issues, but issue volume alone does not create good onboarding.

New contributors need a small curated set of tasks that are:

- clearly scoped
- local to one subsystem
- paired with exact file references
- unlikely to trigger wide architectural surprises

Without that, the issue tracker reinforces the feeling that the project is owned by one person’s full mental model.

## Goal

Create a contributor-onboarding subset of issues that makes it obvious where a new engineer can start safely.

## Requirements

1. Curate a batch of issues intended for first or early contributions
2. For each issue, include:
   - exact likely file touch points
   - scope boundaries
   - acceptance criteria
3. Prefer tasks that are local, testable, and not blocked on broad backend rewrites
4. Group them by subsystem where useful
5. Keep the issue text concrete enough that a contributor can self-serve

## Acceptance criteria

- the project has a visible batch of onboarding-quality issues
- each curated issue is much more actionable than a generic “refactor X” request
- first-time contributors can pick a task without asking for hidden context
