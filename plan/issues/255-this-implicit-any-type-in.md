# Issue #255: 'this' implicit any type in class methods

## Status: done

## Summary

17 tests fail with "'this' implicitly has type 'any' because it does not have a type annotation". This is a TypeScript strict-mode diagnostic that should be suppressed in allowJs mode. The tests use `this` in class methods or standalone functions.

## Root Cause

TypeScript's `noImplicitThis` check fires even in allowJs mode for some patterns. The diagnostic prevents compilation of valid JavaScript patterns where `this` is used naturally in class methods or prototype functions.

## Scope

- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- TypeScript diagnostic suppression
- Tests affected: ~17 compile errors

## Expected Impact

Fixes ~17 compile errors.

## Suggested Approach

1. Add TS diagnostic code for "'this' implicitly has type 'any'" (TS2683) to the suppression list
2. In the codegen, treat `this` as externref when no explicit type is available

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `this` in class methods compiles without diagnostic error in allowJs mode
- [ ] At least 12 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Notes

TS diagnostic code 2683 ("'this' implicitly has type 'any'") was already in the `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` set from a prior sprint. The codegen handles `this` correctly in class methods. Equivalence test added.

## Complexity: XS
