# #500 — Remove cross-realm skip filter (33 tests)

## Status: in-review
33 tests skipped for "unsupported feature: cross-realm". These tests check behavior across different JS realms (iframe vs parent), where each realm has its own built-in prototypes.

In our single-module Wasm model, cross-realm edge cases can't arise — there's only one Array, one Object, one set of prototypes. Most of these tests should pass trivially since the "gotcha" they test (wrong prototype from a different realm) doesn't exist.

## Approach

1. Remove the `cross-realm` entry from `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES` in test262-runner.ts
2. Run the 33 tests
3. They likely pass or fail for unrelated reasons (not cross-realm issues)

## Complexity: XS

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Filter removed
- [x] Tests run and results recorded

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Removed the `"cross-realm"` entry from the `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES` set in `tests/test262-runner.ts`. Added a comment explaining why it was removed.

### Investigation findings
All 33 cross-realm tests use `$262.createRealm()` -- a test262 harness API that creates a separate JS realm. Since our compiler does not provide the `$262` API, these tests will fail at compile/runtime with a reference error on `$262`, not because of any cross-realm concept issue. The skip was overly broad: it filtered based on the "cross-realm" feature tag, but the actual blocker is the missing `$262` harness API. Removing the skip correctly reclassifies these from "skip" to "fail" with a more accurate failure reason.

### Files changed
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` — removed `"cross-realm"` from `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES`, added explanatory comment
