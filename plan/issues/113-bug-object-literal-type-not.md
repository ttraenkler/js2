# Issue 113: Bug — "Object literal type not mapped to struct"

## Summary

When an object literal is used in a context where its type cannot be resolved to
a registered WasmGC struct type, codegen emits:

```
Object literal type not mapped to struct
```

This causes ~5 test failures across multiple categories.

## Example tests

- `test/language/statements/try/12.14-10.js`
- `test/built-ins/Array/isArray/15.4.3.2-0-7.js`
  (`Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.; Object literal type not mapped to struct`)

## Root cause

The compiler assigns WasmGC struct types to object literals by matching their
inferred TypeScript type against the set of pre-registered struct definitions. When:

1. The object literal appears in a position where TypeScript infers a complex or
   union type (e.g., inside a `try` block, or an argument position typed as `any`)
2. The literal's shape hasn't been registered as a named struct

…the lookup fails and codegen throws instead of gracefully emitting a `compile_error`.

## Approach

1. Find the `Object literal type not mapped to struct` throw site in the codegen
2. Add a type-registration fallback: if the literal's TS type is an anonymous object
   type, auto-register a fresh struct for it (similar to how named object types are
   handled)
3. Alternatively, emit a `compile_error` result instead of crashing, so the test
   runner can skip it rather than the whole suite failing
