# #334 -- Private class fields and methods

## Status: open

15 test262 tests fail with "Unknown field privateMethod on struct" or similar errors when accessing private class members (fields, methods, accessors) via the `#name` syntax.

## Error pattern
- Unknown field private* on struct

## Likely causes
- Private field names (prefixed with #) not correctly mapped to struct field names
- Private method references not resolved during property access compilation
- Compound assignment on private fields fails because the field lookup does not match

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Reduce test262 failures matching this error pattern
