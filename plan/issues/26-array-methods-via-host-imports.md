# Issue 26: Array methods via host imports

## Status: done

## Summary
Support common array methods (`.push()`, `.pop()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.forEach()`, `.find()`, `.indexOf()`, `.includes()`, `.slice()`, `.concat()`, `.join()`, `.reverse()`, `.sort()`) by delegating to host-imported functions.

## Motivation
Array methods are fundamental to TypeScript. Without them, users must write manual loops for every operation. The same pattern used for string methods (externref + host import) can be applied.

## Design

### Phase 1: Non-callback methods
Methods that don't take callbacks can be mapped directly to host imports:
- `.push(val)`, `.pop()`, `.indexOf(val)`, `.includes(val)` → host functions operating on GC arrays
- `.length` is already supported via `array.len`

### Phase 2: Callback methods (depends on #7 Closures)
Methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()` require passing a function reference. This depends on closure/callback support (issue #7). Alternatively, these could be implemented as compile-time loop unrolling for simple arrow functions.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — detect array method calls, generate host import calls
- `src/runtime/builtins.ts` — define array helper imports
- Tests: extend `tests/arrays-enums.test.ts`

## Complexity: M (Phase 1), L (Phase 2)

## Depends on
- #7 (Closures) for callback methods

## Acceptance criteria
- Phase 1: `arr.push(4)`, `arr.pop()`, `arr.indexOf(2)`, `arr.includes(3)` work
- Phase 2: `arr.map(x => x * 2)`, `arr.filter(x => x > 0)` work
