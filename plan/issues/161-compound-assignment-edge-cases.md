# #161 — Compound assignment edge cases

## Problem
`string += number` (compound assignment with type coercion) failed at runtime because the `number_toString` import wasn't registered for `PlusEqualsToken` operator.

## Root cause
- The import detection scan in `index.ts` only checked for `PlusToken` (binary `+`) when registering `number_toString`, but not `PlusEqualsToken` (`+=`)
- When `s += 42` was compiled, the codegen correctly tried to call `number_toString` but the import wasn't available, leaving the f64 value unconverted

## Fix
- Extended the import detection to also check for `PlusEqualsToken` when registering `number_toString`
- Also applies the boolean-to-string fix from #158 to `compileStringCompoundAssignment`

## Tests affected
- No new test262 tests unblocked (compound-assignment failures are all class-related `ClassDeclaration` errors)
- Fixed runtime crash for `string += number` patterns

## Status: Done
