# #659 — Call type mismatch residual (609 CE)

## Status: in-review
609 tests fail with call/call_ref argument type mismatches. #626 fixed the main paths but 609 remain — closure calls through globals, method calls with coercion, indirect dispatch.

## Complexity: M

## Analysis

Error analysis of the 609 CE revealed three main bug categories:

### Bug 1: buildTruthyCheck/buildFalsyCheck missing externref handling (18+ tests)
Array callback methods (filter, some, every, find, findIndex) used `call_ref` to invoke closures, then checked the result for truthiness with an `if`. When the closure returned externref (e.g., a callback returning a string), the truthiness check code didn't emit any conversion — leaving externref on the stack where i32 was expected.

Fix: Added `ref.is_null` + `i32.eqz` for externref/ref/ref_null return types.

### Bug 2: compileClosureCall excess arguments (100+ tests)
All closure call paths (`compileClosureCall`, `compileCallablePropertyCall`, wrapper type calls, conditional callee calls, expression callee calls) iterated `expr.arguments.length` when pushing call arguments, even when the closure had fewer declared parameters. For a 0-param closure called with `f(1, 2, 3)`, the 3 arguments were pushed onto the stack before the funcref, causing `call_ref[0]` to see f64 instead of the expected closure struct ref.

Fix: Capped the loop at `Math.min(expr.arguments.length, paramTypes.length)`, with excess arguments compiled for side effects and dropped. Applied to 8 call sites.

### Bug 3: Remaining patterns (not yet fixed)
- `call[0] expected type (ref null N), found global.get externref` — method dispatch where module globals produce externref but method expects struct ref
- `call[0] expected type externref, found call of type f64` — various call sites where function return type doesn't match expected parameter type
- `call[0] expected type f64, found call of type externref` — inverse of above
