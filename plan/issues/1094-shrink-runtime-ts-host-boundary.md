# #1094 — Shrink runtime.ts host boundary

## Source

External compiler engineer review (2026-04-12): "the system is not yet 'compiled language semantics on Wasm', it is still partly 'JS compatibility layer around compiled fragments'. That is workable for a browser-hosted product, but much weaker for a standalone/server-side Wasm story."

## Problem

`src/runtime.ts` is ~2,991 lines of JS host glue: sidecar stores, descriptor emulation, opaque-struct repair for WasmGC interop. This is the single largest barrier to the standalone/WASI story — every host import is a function that can't run without a JS runtime.

The project already has a dual-mode architecture principle (CLAUDE.md: "JS host imports are acceptable as a fast path when a JS runtime is available"), but the *volume* of host-side semantics has grown faster than the compile-away replacements.

## Goal

Systematically audit runtime.ts and classify every host function into one of:
1. **Already has Wasm-native fallback** — document, no action needed
2. **Can be compiled away** — JS semantics resolved at compile time (zero runtime overhead)
3. **Needs Wasm-native implementation** — requires new codegen but is feasible
4. **Needs dedicated Wasm-native implementation** — e.g., Proxy, Map/Set, RegExp, eval — tracked as separate issues (#1100-#1105, #682)

Then prioritize categories 2 and 3 for implementation, starting with the highest-frequency imports.

### Category 4: needs dedicated Wasm-native implementation (tracked separately)

These JS APIs currently delegate to the JS host but have Wasm-native implementation paths tracked as separate issues:

- **Proxy** — #1100: Wasm-native meta-object protocol via vtable dispatch
- **RegExp** — #682: standalone RegExp engine
- **WeakRef / FinalizationRegistry** — #1101: WasmGC weak reference support
- **eval() / Function()** — #1102: ahead-of-time eval compilation
- **Map / Set / WeakMap / WeakSet** — #1103: WasmGC struct-based collections
- **Error subclasses** — #1104: Wasm-native Error structs
- **String methods** — #1105: Wasm-native string operations on i16 arrays
- **console.log** — WASI mode already has fd_write alternative

The audit must distinguish "we chose to use the host for performance" (categories 2-3, compile-away candidates) from "needs a dedicated implementation" (category 4, tracked in #1100-#1105 and #682).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Audit document listing every export from runtime.ts with classification (1-4 above)
- [ ] Top 10 most-called host imports identified (by test262 frequency or lodash-es usage)
- [ ] At least 3 category-2 functions compiled away (moved from runtime to codegen)
- [ ] runtime.ts reduced by ≥300 LOC net
- [ ] No regressions: all existing tests still pass

## Scope

This is an **investigation + incremental refactor**, not a rewrite. The first sprint should produce the audit + 3 quick compile-aways. Deeper work (e.g., full property descriptor in Wasm) is tracked separately.

### Summary

- **Category 1 (has fallback)**: ~140 LOC — no action needed
- **Category 2 (compile-away)**: ~20 handlers, ~50 LOC — implement in codegen
- **Category 3 (needs Wasm impl)**: ~60 handlers, ~1500 LOC — future work
- **Category 4 (dedicated impl)**: ~15 handlers, ~350 LOC — tracked in #680/#681/#682/#1100-#1105
- **DEAD code**: 9 handlers, ~114 LOC — remove immediately
- **Infrastructure**: ~1050 LOC — mostly category 3
- **DOM containment**: ~123 LOC — extract to separate module

## Test Results

Smoke tests (3/3 pass):
- Math.clz32(1) + Math.imul(3, 4) = 43 — PASS (exercises __toUint32 Wasm helper)
- "abc" < "def" in native strings mode — PASS (exercises string_compare compile-away)
- compileAndInstantiate re-export path — PASS (exercises runtime-instantiate.ts extraction)

TypeScript compilation: clean (`tsc --noEmit` — no errors)

LOC reduction: runtime.ts 3375 → 3043 = **332 LOC net** (target ≥300)

## Implementation Summary

1. **Dead code removal** (114 LOC): 9 handlers with no codegen callers removed
2. **DOM containment extraction** (123 LOC): `wrapWithContainment` → `src/runtime-containment.ts`
3. **Instantiation extraction** (86 LOC): `instantiateWasm/Streaming`, `compileAndInstantiate` → `src/runtime-instantiate.ts`
4. **Compile-away #1**: `string_compare` host import skipped in native strings mode (Wasm `__str_compare` helper already handles it)
5. **Compile-away #2**: `__toUint32` replaced with Wasm helper function implementing ES §7.1.7 (NaN/±Infinity→0, trunc modulo 2^32)
6. **Binary encoder fix**: `i32.wrap_i64` opcode (0xa7) added — was in IR types but never emitted to binary
