# Issue #140: Object computed property names not working at runtime

## Status: done

## Problem
Object literals with computed property names (e.g., `{ [expr]: value }`) and bracket-notation property access on struct types (`obj['key']`) were causing compile errors. Additionally, getter/setter accessors with computed names or non-identifier names weren't being compiled.

## Root causes
1. **Bracket access on structs**: `obj['key']` on a Wasm struct type resulted in "Element access on struct type" compile error. Only vec (array) and tuple structs had element access support.
2. **Bracket assignment on structs**: `obj['key'] = value` on a struct resulted in "Assignment to non-array type" compile error.
3. **Computed accessor names**: `get ['name']()` and `set ['name'](v)` in object literals only worked if the property name was an identifier (`ts.isIdentifier`), not string/numeric/computed.
4. **Falsy empty-string check**: `if (!propName) continue;` skipped valid empty-string property names because `""` is falsy in JS.
5. **Numeric literal in computed keys**: `resolveComputedKeyExpression` didn't handle numeric literals like `[0]`, `[0x10]`.
6. **Non-canonical numeric names**: Numeric literals like `0x10` need to be canonicalized to `"16"` for consistent field lookup.

## Changes made

### `src/codegen/expressions.ts`
- **`compileElementAccess`**: Added string/numeric literal, const variable, and constant-expression index resolution for struct types. Also added getter accessor support via bracket notation.
- **`compileElementAssignment`**: Added struct field assignment and setter accessor support via bracket notation.
- **`resolveAccessorPropName`** (new): Helper to resolve property names from identifiers, string/numeric literals, and computed property names.
- **`resolveConstantExpression`** (new): Compile-time constant evaluator for arithmetic, string concat, parenthesized expressions, prefix unary, and const variable references.
- **`resolveComputedKeyExpression`**: Added numeric literal support with canonical form (`String(Number(text))`).
- **`resolvePropertyNameText`**: Changed numeric literal resolution to canonical form.
- **`compileObjectLiteralForStruct`**: Updated getter/setter accessor registration to handle computed, string, and numeric property names (not just identifiers). Fixed `!propName` to `propName === undefined`.

### `tests/test262-runner.ts`
- **String assert routing**: Updated regex for `assert_sameValue` → `assert_sameValue_str` routing to handle bracket-access expressions like `obj['prop']` in addition to simple identifiers and dot access.

## Test results
- **Before**: 43 pass / 0 fail / 394 compile_error / 733 skip in `expr/object`
- **After**: 129 pass / 0 fail / 308 compile_error / 733 skip in `expr/object`
- **Equivalence tests**: 72/72 pass (no regressions)

## Remaining issues (out of scope)
- Getter/setter closures: Accessor bodies that reference outer scope variables fail with "Unsupported assignment target" or "Unknown identifier" (pre-existing issue, not related to computed property names).
- Many test262 object tests are skipped due to unrelated unsupported features (eval, Symbol, typeof string comparison, etc.).

## Implementation Summary
All six features described in this issue were already implemented across earlier PRs (primarily #239 for bracket-notation field resolution, plus subsequent work on computed keys and accessor prop names). This PR verifies correctness and adds dedicated test coverage.

### What was done
- Confirmed that `compileElementAccess` resolves string literals, numeric literals, const variable references, and constant expressions to struct field names
- Confirmed that `compileElementAssignment` supports the same resolution patterns for bracket-notation assignment on structs, including setter accessor dispatch
- Confirmed that `compileObjectLiteralForStruct` handles getter/setter accessors with computed, string, and numeric property names via `resolveAccessorPropName`
- Confirmed that `resolvePropertyNameText` handles numeric literals with canonical form (`String(Number(text))`)
- Confirmed that `resolveComputedKeyExpression` delegates to `resolveConstantExpression` for full constant folding
- Added `tests/issue-140.test.ts` with 8 equivalence tests covering all described scenarios

### Files changed
- `tests/issue-140.test.ts` (new) -- 8 tests for bracket access, bracket assignment, computed property names, getter/setter with computed names, numeric literal keys
- `plan/issues/sprints/0/140.md` -- moved from ready, updated status and summary

### Tests now passing
All 8 new tests pass. 26 equivalence tests and 19 closed-imports tests pass with no regressions.
