# #868 -- Playground: lazy-load test262 tree and file contents

## Problem

Loading 48K test262 results + file contents at startup would block the playground for seconds. The test suite section needs progressive, on-demand loading.

## Requirements

### 1. Three-tier lazy loading

**Tier 1 — Section open (instant):** Load only the summary JSON (~1KB):
```json
{ "pass": 18167, "fail": 21663, "ce": 1966, "timeout": 289, "skip": 6580 }
```
Show the headline stats and top-level category list with aggregated bars. No individual test data loaded yet.

**Tier 2 — Category expand (on click):** Fetch that category's results chunk:
```
GET /api/test262/category/language/expressions
```
Returns ~500-2000 entries with status + error summary (no full error text). Renders subcategory tree + progress bars.

**Tier 3 — File click (on click):** Fetch individual test details:
```
GET /api/test262/file/language/expressions/class/elements/foo.js
```
Returns: full error message, compile_ms, exec_ms, and the test262 source file content for Monaco.

### 2. Data preparation

Pre-aggregate results at build time or precompile time into a directory structure:

```
benchmarks/results/test262-tree/
  summary.json                    # tier 1: top-level stats
  language/
    expressions.json              # tier 2: all tests in this category
    statements.json
  built-ins/
    Array.json
    Map.json
    ...
```

Each category JSON contains:
```json
{
  "summary": { "pass": 4596, "fail": 5231, ... },
  "subcategories": { "class": { "pass": 1200, ... }, ... },
  "tests": [
    { "file": "foo.js", "status": "pass", "compile_ms": 12, "exec_ms": 3 },
    { "file": "bar.js", "status": "fail", "error_short": "returned 2", "line": 15 }
  ]
}
```

Full error messages and source files loaded only on tier 3 (file click).

### 3. Build step

Add a script `scripts/build-test262-tree.ts` that reads `test262-results.jsonl` + `test262-compile.jsonl` and produces the tree structure. Run after each test262 run.

### 4. UI behavior

- Categories show a spinner while loading tier 2 data
- Expanding a category caches its data (no re-fetch on collapse/expand)
- File click shows a loading indicator while fetching source
- Progressive rendering: show categories as they arrive, don't wait for all
- Virtual scrolling for categories with 1000+ tests (e.g., language/expressions)

## Acceptance criteria

- Playground loads instantly (no test262 data at startup beyond summary)
- Categories load in <200ms on click
- File + Monaco opens in <500ms on click
- Works offline (all data served from local build output)
- 48K tests browsable without lag
