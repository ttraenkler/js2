# Issue 129: propertyHelper.js test262 harness include

## Summary

341 test262 tests require `propertyHelper.js` from the test262 harness. This
include provides helpers to verify property attributes (configurable, enumerable,
writable).

## Decision

Keep skipped. Property attribute verification is tied to Object.defineProperty
(#125) and property descriptors, which are fundamental JS runtime features we
don't support.

## Complexity

N/A — Blocked by #125.
