# #922 -- Add a reproducible test262 baseline-diff workflow so regressions are compared against current clean HEAD

## Problem

The recent `909` investigation showed that comparing branch results against an older stored baseline can be misleading.

What happened:

- the branch initially looked regressed relative to April 1 data
- targeted A/B checks showed the representative failures were already present on clean `HEAD`
- the correct clean-`HEAD` baseline had to be produced manually in a detached compare worktree

Without a lightweight baseline-diff workflow, future refactors will keep being judged against stale data.

## Goal

Make it easy to generate a trustworthy clean-`HEAD` baseline and compare any branch or dirty workspace against it.

## Requirements

1. Define a repeatable way to run test262 on clean `HEAD`
2. Define a repeatable way to diff branch results against that clean baseline
3. Ensure the workflow does not silently test the wrong tree when local changes exist
4. Make the expected result artifacts clear:
   - JSONL results
   - summary report
   - optional category/status transition breakdown
5. Document the workflow briefly enough that it can be used during refactors

## Acceptance criteria

- contributors can produce a clean-`HEAD` baseline without ad hoc shell work
- branch-vs-baseline comparison uses current clean `HEAD`, not a stale historical report by default
- the workflow is documented in code, script help, or contributor docs

## Test Results

This is a tooling-only change (new script, no compiler changes). Verified:
- Self-diff (same file vs itself): 0 regressions, 0 improvements, correct counts (48,088 tests)
- Synthetic diff (4→5 tests): correctly detects 1 regression (pass→fail), 3 improvements (fail→pass, CE→pass, absent→pass), error category breakdown, exit code 1 on regressions
- `--help` flag works, `--verbose`/`--all`/`--quiet` flags respected

No equivalence or test262 regressions possible — no compiler code changed.

## Implementation

Added `scripts/diff-test262.ts`:
- Loads two JSONL files, builds file→status maps
- Classifies transitions: regressions (pass→other), improvements (other→pass), other
- Reports: status table with delta, regression list with error messages, improvement list, error category breakdown, net pass delta
- Exits non-zero if regressions found (useful in CI)
- Flags: `--verbose` (50 items), `--all` (no limit), `--quiet` (counts only), `--help`

Usage: `npx tsx scripts/diff-test262.ts <baseline.jsonl> <new.jsonl>`
