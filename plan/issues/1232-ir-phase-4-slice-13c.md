# #1232 — IR Phase 4 Slice 13c: String fixed-signature methods through IR

## Problem

After #1238 registers String as a pseudo-`ExternClassInfo`, the
high-frequency String prototype methods can lower through the existing
extern dispatch path. They're "fixed signature" in the sense that each
method has a single concrete `[receiver, args...] -> result` shape (no
generic per-element-type dispatch).

Target methods (in priority order by test262 frequency):
- `str.slice(start: f64, end?: f64): string`
- `str.charAt(i: f64): string`
- `str.charCodeAt(i: f64): f64`
- `str.indexOf(search: string, fromIndex?: f64): f64`
- `str.includes(search: string): bool`
- `str.startsWith(search: string): bool`
- `str.endsWith(search: string): bool`
- `str.toUpperCase(): string`
- `str.toLowerCase(): string`
- `str.trim(): string`

## Implementation notes

- Each method maps to an existing native helper in `ctx.nativeStrHelpers`
  (`__str_slice`, `__str_charAt`, `__str_indexOf`, etc.). The IR's
  `resolveFunc` already finds these by name; lowering emits
  `cx.builder.emitFuncCall(funcRef, args, returnType)`.
- Args of type f64 must be truncated to i32 via the `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s`
  IR unary (added in #1169o). This is a per-method concern: the
  pseudo-extern registry for String can declare arg types as i32 so the
  generic extern path applies the truncation automatically (or add a
  per-arg coercion step in `coerceToExpectedExtern`).
- String returns: native helpers return the native string ref type
  (`(ref $AnyString)` in nativeStrings mode, or externref in JS-host
  mode). The IR's `IrType.string` already abstracts both; the result
  type needs to widen back to `IrType.string` after the call.
- `nativeStrings` mode vs JS-host mode: in JS-host mode some methods
  go through `wasm:js-string` builtin imports rather than our native
  helpers. The pseudo-extern registry can pick the right import name
  per mode.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Each listed method, when used in an IR-claimable function, is
   claimed and lowered correctly.
2. End-to-end test (in `tests/issue-1232.test.ts`) covers each method
   with both modes (nativeStrings on/off) and asserts the IR result
   matches legacy.
3. No regression in #1169p (`arr.length`) or other slice-1..13 tests.

## MLIR alignment

String method dispatch must read receiver type from the `TypeMap` produced by
`propagate()` (see #1231 MLIR Compatibility section), **not** from a hardcoded
method table or inline `atom.kind` checks. The `resolveFunc` path that maps
`str.slice(...)` to `__str_slice` should be parameterised by `TypeMap` so a
future MLIR optimizer can produce the same map without changes to the emitter.

Concretely: `resolveStringMethod(node, typeMap)` → `FuncRef | null`, where the
lookup is keyed on `typeMap.get(node.receiver)?.kind === "string"`. This matches
the #1231 TypeMap contract and keeps the method-dispatch table MLIR-replaceable.
