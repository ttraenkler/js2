# #446 -- Wasm validation: call_ref type mismatch (56 CE)

## Problem

56 tests fail Wasm validation because a `call_ref` instruction's operand types do not match the referenced function type. The arguments on the stack or the function reference itself have the wrong type.

Common causes:
- Closure calls where the captured function has a different signature than expected
- Callback arguments passed with wrong types
- Higher-order functions where the function type is not properly tracked

## Priority: medium (56 tests)

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] call_ref emissions verify argument types match the function type
- [x] Type coercion applied to arguments before call_ref when needed
- [ ] CE count for call_ref type mismatch reduced by at least 70%

## Implementation Summary

Three changes to `src/codegen/expressions.ts`:

1. **Callable parameter dispatch**: When `compileCallExpression` encounters an identifier callee that is a local variable/parameter but not in `funcMap`/`closureMap`, and has call signatures, it creates/finds a matching closure wrapper type via `getOrCreateFuncRefWrapperTypes` and emits `any.convert_extern` + `ref.cast` + `call_ref`.

2. **Host vs user callback routing**: `isCallbackArgument` became `isHostCallbackArgument` -- arrows passed to user-defined functions use `compileArrowAsClosure` (GC struct) instead of `compileArrowAsCallback` (`__make_callback` host).

3. **Shared struct types for no-capture closures**: `compileArrowAsClosure` reuses wrapper struct types for closures with no captures, ensuring compatible `ref.cast` at call sites.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`
- `tests/test-call-ref.test.ts` (new)

### Tests
- 5 new tests, all passing
- No regressions in equivalence tests
