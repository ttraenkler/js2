# Sprint 3

**Date**: 2026-03-11 (evening)
**Goal**: Zero runtime failures, ~1,500 CE reduction
**Baseline**: ~1,509 pass

## Issues
- #225, #245 — String comparison in equality ops and switch statements
- #226, #248 — valueOf coercion on object literal comparisons, logical op tests
- #227, #228 — BigInt comparison/equality with Number and Infinity
- #231, #253 — Remove overly broad typeof and loose inequality skip filters
- #233, #256 — Nested function hoisting in loops/switch
- #236, #240 — Super/derived-class diagnostic suppression
- #244 — In operator runtime failures
- #246 — Missing struct fields in for-of object destructuring
- #247 — Null/undefined arithmetic correct results
- #251, #252, #255 — Equivalence tests
- #254 — Private class field assignment diagnostic suppression

## Results
**Final numbers**: merged same session, incremental improvements
**Delta**: 13 issues marked done
