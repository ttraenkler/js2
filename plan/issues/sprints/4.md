# Sprint 4

**Date**: 2026-03-11 to 2026-03-12
**Goal**: Diagnostic suppression, bracket notation, destructuring, compound assignment
**Baseline**: ~1,509 pass

## Issues
- #257, #258 — Method calls on returned values, nested call expressions
- #259 — ClassDeclaration in block scope tests
- #261, #273 — New expression with inline/anonymous class expressions
- #262, #265, #267, #269, #270, #275, #276 — Batch diagnostic suppression
- #263 — Dynamic property access fallback
- #264 — Bracket notation write path for const keys
- #266 — Scope resolution for multi-variable destructuring
- #268 — Suppress TS2548 iterator protocol diagnostic
- #272 — Re-lookup funcIdx after arg compilation (stale indices)
- #277 — Type coercion before local.set/local.tee
- #278 — Auto-register anonymous struct types
- #279 — Arrow function destructuring params and defaults
- #280 — Function expression name binding and closure call
- #281 — Object literal method names and spread ordering
- #282 — Scan top-level statements for string literals
- #283 — Compound assignment type coercion
- #284 — Nested destructuring and rest elements in for-of
- #285 — Complex for-loop initializers
- #286 — Logical assignment on property/element access
- #316 — Array element access bounds checking

## Results
**Final numbers**: incremental (same multi-day session)
**Delta**: Major reduction in compile errors from diagnostic suppression

## Notes
- Batch diagnostic suppression commit at 2026-03-12 03:21
- Transitioned from formal sprints to dependency-driven execution after this sprint
