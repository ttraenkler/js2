# Sprint 47

**Date**: 2026-05-01 → 2026-05-03
**Baseline**: 27,104 / 46,632 = 58.1% pass (at S46 close, after #1177/#1219/#1220/#1221)
**Final**: 26,247 / 43,088 = 60.9% pass (test suite trimmed; ~2% net conformance gain)
**Created**: 2026-05-01 — seeded from S46 analysis + failure landscape review
**Groomed**: 2026-05-01 — tech lead + PO session

## Goals

1. **IR migration completion** — advance IR slices 11–14 to cover switch, missing operators, element access, array literals, and prototype methods; retire legacy codegen
2. **Test262 conformance** — fix class/dstr default parameter ordering (408 failures), TDZ destructure-assign writer+reader
3. **CI quality** — wasm-hash noise filter to eliminate symmetric flip false positives
4. **Performance** — escape-analysis scalarization for array-sum benchmark (9× gap vs V8)

## Retrospective

### What shipped

Sprint 47 was the largest sprint to date: 631 commits, 50+ issues closed across 3 days.

**IR migration (slices 11–14)**
- Slice 11: switch statements + missing binary/unary operators through IR
- Slice 12: dynamic element access + array literals through IR
- Slice 13: String + Array prototype methods through IR (13b pseudo-ExternClassInfo, 13c String fixed-sig methods)
- Slice 14: legacy codegen retirement — `expressions.ts`/`statements.ts` deleted

**Performance**
- Escape-analysis scalarization: eliminates array allocation in fill+reduce shape
- Bounds-check elimination via SSA on monotonic indexed loops
- i32 element specialization for `number[]` under `|0`/`& mask`/`>> n`
- Pre-size dense arrays at allocation site
- Struct field type inference Phase 2: eliminates boxing in object properties
- Eval/RegExp LRU: no recompile in 65k-loop tests (compile_timeouts down)

**Conformance fixes**
- Class/dstr defaults: TypeError guard fires before default applied (408 failures fixed)
- Nested dstr from null/undefined: missing TypeError (~244 tests)
- Class private fields and methods (#name syntax)
- Logical assignment (||=, &&=, ??=)
- RegExp constructor with flags='undefinedy' regression (~288 tests)
- for-of assign-dstr routes writes through boxedCaptures (#1258)
- Dstr of null/undefined throws TypeError (#1260)

**Module / npm library support**
- CJS module.exports → Wasm export mapping
- CJS require() static module graph
- Optional chaining ?. and ?.()
- Typed string[] local with split() fix
- typeof x === 'string' guard fix
- index-signature obj[key] ??= returns NaN fix
- WeakMap host-import type dispatch fix
- Class-typed dict values extern round-trip identity fix
- Object.keys(any).join() externref cast fix
- Hono Tier 2 + Tier 3 (TrieRouter) stress tests
- ESLint Tier 1 + invalid Wasm fix + array.set type mismatch fix

**TypeScript 7 / tooling**
- TS7 @typescript/native-preview feature flag (#1288)
- test262 runner TS7 batch-parse forEachChild compat helper (#1290, 132× cold speedup)
- SameValue f64 comparison for DefineProperty (#1252)
- OrdinaryToPrimitive throws TypeError (#1253)
- __any_eq loose equality i31ref vs HeapNumber fix (#1134)

**CI quality**
- Wasm-hash noise filter: byte-identical regressions excluded from PR gate
- Differential test262: branch-vs-main with src-tree-hash caching
- Baseline drift prevention after admin-merges
- Benchmark baseline auto-commit on push-to-main
- Baseline-validate TS checker non-determinism fix
- Runner pool timeout starts at dispatch, not enqueue (156 false CTs eliminated)

### What didn't land

- #1223 TDZ async/gen writer+reader: still blocked on #1177 Stage 1 — carry to S48
- #1126 int32 inference: deferred again (needs architect spec) — carry to S48
- #1177 Stage 1 re-land: needs senior-dev Opus investigation — carry to S48

### Process notes

- Merge queue management: 8 open PRs at once created coordination overhead. More frequent intra-sprint merges (daily instead of batch) would reduce conflict resolution work.
- Baseline drift caused spurious "failure" conclusions on ci-status files for 6 PRs; all required admin-merge with manual evidence review. The differential test (#1246) and wasm-hash filter (#1222) have now automated the analysis, but the ci-status-feed SHA mismatch window still requires tech-lead judgment.
- TS7 batch-parse discovered and shipped in same sprint as investigation — fast turnaround model working well for research-to-implementation.
