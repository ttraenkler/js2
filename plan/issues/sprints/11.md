# Sprint 11

**Date**: 2026-03-18 (afternoon/evening)
**Goal**: Massive feature push — WASI, native strings, WIT, tail calls, SIMD, type annotations
**Baseline**: 6,366 pass / 23,021 total

## Issues
- #493-#556 — 53 issues in a single session, including:
  - WASI target support (--target wasi)
  - Native strings (WasmGC i16 arrays)
  - WIT generator for Component Model
  - Tail call optimization (return_call/return_call_ref)
  - Peephole optimizer
  - Native type annotations (type i32 = number)
  - Prototype chain improvements
  - Delete operator support
  - TypedArray/ArrayBuffer support
  - Async/await improvements
  - Generator improvements
  - For-of improvements

## Results
**Final numbers**: 6,366 pass / 23,025 total (second run, minimal change)
**Delta**: +0 pass (feature additions, not test262 focused)

## Notes
- This is the famous "53 issues in one session" mentioned in CLAUDE.md Sprint History
- Major architectural additions: WASI, WIT, tail calls, SIMD
- CLI flags added: --target wasi, --optimize, --wit, --nativeStrings
- Test262 runs at 22:43 UTC show same pass count — new features weren't test262-targeted
