# Sprint 26

**Date**: 2026-03-27 (evening) to 2026-03-28 (early)
**Goal**: Exception tag fix, honest baseline, multi-file compilation
**Baseline**: 15,197 pass / 49,881 total (stale cache)

## Issues
- #819 — Multi-file compilation for _FIXTURE tests via compileMulti
- #820 — Arguments object in class/object methods + guarded coercion
- #779 — NaN sentinel defaults, for-in vec enum, class null deref
- #822 — externref→f64 coercion (added then reverted — regression)

## Results
**Final numbers**: 13,289 pass / 36,828 total (fresh run with worker threads)
**Delta**: Honest baseline established — previous 15,197 was stale cache

## Notes
- Exception tag fix revealed stale cache was inflating numbers
- Fresh complete run: 13,289 pass / 36,828 total
- Previous stale cache: 15,197 pass / 49,881 total
- Difference: unblocked ~4,000 previously-skipped tests which mostly fail
- Error categories: assertion_fail 9,259, type_error 3,730, wasm_compile 2,904
- This became the honest baseline for future sessions
