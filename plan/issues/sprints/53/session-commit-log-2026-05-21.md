# Session commit log — 2026-05-21

## Sync

- Pre-sync `/workspace` HEAD: `2a0545c8e` (1 commit ahead, 600 commits behind `origin/main`)
- Pulled to: `fc74b08804c11c63fe0ee096c86a5e05790a2753` (origin/main)
- Local commit `2a0545c8e` (#1559 `status: ready`) discarded — origin/main flipped to `status: needs-spec`, newer team decision.
- Method: work done on `sync-session-2026-05-21` branch in agent worktree (`/workspace/.claude/worktrees/agent-a6bb29e3e169bc6d2`); local `main` left untouched so the user can fast-forward after the PR lands.

## Conflict files resolved

| File | Resolution |
|------|-----------|
| `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` | Took HEAD — local 113-line `Object()` addition was duplicate of PR #460 / #1129 already on origin/main |
| `plan/issues/1129-toobject-7-1-18-not.md` | Took HEAD (`status: done`, task #77 completed) |
| `plan/issues/sprints/53/1559-resolver-...-codegen.md` | Took HEAD (`status: needs-spec`, team disagreed with local `ready`) |
| `plan/issues/sprints/53/1560-cjs-class-reexport-...md` | Took HEAD (`status: done`, task #76 completed) |
| `benchmarks/results/test262-report.json` + `~Updated upstream` orphan | Took HEAD symlink; removed orphan |
