# Sprint 24

**Date**: 2026-03-27 (early morning)
**Goal**: valueOf recursion fixes, depth limiter, String/prototype unblocking
**Baseline**: ~15,182 pass / 49,840 total

## Issues
- #675 — Dynamic import argument evaluation
- #696 — Classify test262 runtime errors into 14 categories
- #701 — Recursion depth guard for resolveWasmType
- #733 — RangeError validation + invalid drop fix
- #736 — 12 new SyntaxError early error checks
- #737 — Emit JS undefined (not null) for missing args/uninit vars
- #816 — Removed String/prototype skip filter (1,073 tests re-enabled)

## Results
**Final numbers**: 14,169 pass → 14,616 pass / 49,880 total
**Delta**: +447 pass (from session start of 14,169)

## Notes
- Test262 runs show volatile numbers as skip filters were adjusted:
  - 00:28: 13,532 (after removing filters, many new failures)
  - 00:53: 13,985 (partial recovery)
  - 01:57: 15,833 (partial run)
  - 04:11: 14,616 (stable full run)
- valueOf recursion was causing compilation hangs — depth limiter added
- String/prototype tests unblocked (previously skipped)
- Compilation depth tuning: 200 → 500 → 2000 → 5000 → final setting
