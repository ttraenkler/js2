# Research: ES standard support matrix for all JS-to-Wasm engines

## Problem

Our blog comparison table says "test262 ~99%" or "~50%" but doesn't break down *which* ES standards each engine supports. ES5 vs ES2015 vs ES2024 is a massive difference. A project claiming 50% test262 might have full ES5 + partial ES2015, or it might have scattered support across all specs. Readers need to know which language features actually work.

## Engines to research

1. V8 (baseline — full ES2024+)
2. QuickJS / QuickJS-ng
3. Javy (inherits QuickJS)
4. StarlingMonkey (inherits SpiderMonkey)
5. Static Hermes
6. Porffor
7. js2wasm
8. JAWSM
9. AssemblyScript (which JS features does its dialect support?)
10. Wasmnizer-ts (which TS subset?)

## ES feature categories to check

For each engine, determine support level (full / partial / none) for:

### ES5 (2009)
- strict mode, JSON, Array extras (map/filter/reduce), Function.bind

### ES2015 (ES6)
- let/const, arrow functions, classes, template literals, destructuring, default params, rest/spread, for-of, Symbol, Promise, Map/Set, WeakMap/WeakSet, generators, iterators, Proxy, Reflect, modules (import/export), computed property names

### ES2016-ES2020
- async/await, exponentiation operator, Array.includes, Object.entries/values, string padding, SharedArrayBuffer, Atomics, optional catch binding, Array.flat/flatMap, Object.fromEntries, globalThis, BigInt, optional chaining (?.), nullish coalescing (??)

### ES2021-ES2024
- String.replaceAll, Promise.any, logical assignment (&&= ||= ??=), WeakRef, FinalizationRegistry, Array.at, Object.hasOwn, Error.cause, top-level await, Array.findLast, Symbols as WeakMap keys, Array.groupBy, Promise.withResolvers, ArrayBuffer.resize, Set methods

### Key JS semantics (not version-specific)
- eval / Function constructor
- with statement
- Proxy / Reflect
- proper tail calls
- RegExp (full spec vs subset)
- prototype chain manipulation
- property descriptors / Object.defineProperty
- getter/setter
- typeof / instanceof full semantics
- error types (TypeError, RangeError, etc.)

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Matrix showing each engine x ES feature category with support level
- [ ] For AOT compilers: distinguish "compiles but wrong" from "doesn't compile" from "fully works"
- [ ] Sources cited (docs, test262 breakdown, GitHub issues, READMEs)
- [ ] Results added to blog comparison section
