# #826 -- Illegal cast failures (1,294 runtime failures)

## Problem

1,294 tests fail with "illegal cast" at runtime. The Wasm `ref.cast` instruction traps because the runtime value's type does not match the expected struct type. This is distinct from null_deref (null pointer) and type_error (null/undefined access).

### Dominant pattern: Destructuring parameters (805 tests / 62%)

The majority of illegal_cast failures share the same root cause as null_deref #825 -- destructuring parameter binding -- but instead of dereferencing null, the cast fails because the parameter value is a different Wasm struct type than expected.

```js
// Arrow function with destructuring
var f = ([a, b]) => { return a; };
f([1, 2]); // illegal cast: the array argument is externref but cast expects array struct
```

The compiled code emits `ref.cast $ArrayStruct` but the runtime value is an externref-wrapped JS array (or an anyref that went through extern.convert_any roundtrip), which does not match.

### Sample files with exact errors

**1. Empty object destructuring pattern**
File: `test/language/destructuring/binding/initialization-returns-normal-completion-for-empty-objects.js`
Error: `illegal cast`
```js
// Line 23:
function fn({}) { return true; }
assert(fn(0)); // 0 is not an object struct
```
Root cause: `ref.cast $ObjectStruct` on a boxed number (f64) fails.

**2. Arrow function array destructuring iter close**
File: `test/language/expressions/arrow-function/dstr/ary-init-iter-close.js`
Error: `illegal cast`
Root cause: Iterator record is an externref, cast to iterator struct type fails.

**3. Default parameter abrupt completion**
File: `test/language/expressions/arrow-function/dflt-params-abrupt.js`
Error: `illegal cast`
```js
// Test expects: evaluating default parameter initializer throws
(x = (function() { throw new Test262Error(); })()) => {}
```
Root cause: The Test262Error thrown during default param evaluation is caught as an externref, but the catch handler casts it to a specific struct type.

**4. Arguments object length in shadowed scope**
File: `test/language/arguments-object/10.6-6-3.js`
Error: `illegal cast`
```js
// Line 12-14:
function testcase() {
    var arguments = undefined;
    (function () { assert.sameValue(arguments.length, 0); })();
}
```
Root cause: Inner function's `arguments` object is an externref (because outer scope shadowed it), cast to arguments struct fails.

**5. Arguments object in async generator**
File: `test/language/arguments-object/async-gen-named-func-expr-args-trailing-comma-multiple.js`
Error: `illegal cast`
Root cause: Arguments object in async generator named function expression uses wrong struct type.

**6. Proxy revocable trap**
File: `test/built-ins/Proxy/apply/trap-is-null-target-is-proxy.js` (nearby tests)
Error: `illegal cast`
Root cause: Proxy target is another Proxy; cast to the inner proxy's target struct fails.

**7. Private field access from inner arrow function**
File: `test/language/expressions/class/elements/private-field-access-on-inner-arrow-function.js`
Error: `illegal cast`
```js
class C {
  #field = 42;
  method() {
    const inner = () => this.#field;
    return inner();
  }
}
```
Root cause: Closure captures `this` as externref, but `this.#field` casts to class struct type which fails after extern.convert_any roundtrip.

## Root cause analysis

### 1. Destructuring parameter binding (805 tests)
In `src/codegen/statements.ts`, when compiling destructuring parameters:
- Array patterns emit `ref.cast $ArrayStruct` on the argument, but the argument may be an externref-wrapped JS value
- Object patterns emit `ref.cast $ObjectStruct` but the argument may be a primitive or externref
- The fix is to use `ref.test` before `ref.cast`, and if the test fails, convert via the appropriate path (extern.convert_any -> any.convert_extern -> ref.cast, or coerce primitive to object)

### 2. Exception handling type mismatch (46 tests)
In `src/codegen/statements.ts`, catch handlers cast the caught exception to a specific struct type, but exceptions thrown from default parameter evaluation may be a different type.

### 3. Closure this-capture type loss (19 tests)
In `src/codegen/expressions.ts`, closure capture of `this` stores it as externref. When the inner function accesses `this.#field`, the ref.cast to the class struct type fails because the externref roundtrip loses the concrete type.

### 4. Proxy / Function built-in type confusion (60 tests)
In `src/codegen/expressions.ts`, Proxy and Function.prototype methods receive externref arguments that are cast to specific struct types without type testing first.

## Suggested fix

1. In destructuring parameter binding (`src/codegen/statements.ts`):
   - Replace bare `ref.cast` with `ref.test` + conditional path
   - For array patterns: test if value is array struct, else convert from externref
   - For object patterns: test if value is object struct, else wrap primitive

2. In closure this-capture (`src/codegen/expressions.ts`):
   - Store `this` in closure ref cell with the concrete class struct type instead of externref
   - Or use `ref.test` + `ref.cast` with fallback for the externref path

3. In exception catch blocks (`src/codegen/statements.ts`):
   - Use `ref.test` before `ref.cast` on caught exceptions
   - Handle externref exceptions generically

## Acceptance criteria

- 1,294 illegal_cast failures resolved or reduced by >=70%
- Destructuring parameters handle externref/primitive arguments without trapping
- Private member access from closures works correctly

## Sprint-31 Regression Warning

**APPROACH 1 THAT FAILED**: Guarding bare ref.cast with ref.test + if/else, using ref.null fallback. The ref.null produces null downstream → null deref traps in struct.get/struct.set. Fixed 255 tests but caused ~1,300 null deref regressions.

**APPROACH 2 THAT FAILED**: Changing ref.null fallback to throw (via exception tag). The throw caused Wasm exceptions propagating as different errors. Even worse.

**PARTIAL SUCCESS**: buildGuardedCast with ref.null fallback in index.ts was net positive when combined with other changes, but the stack-balance.ts changes (fixLocalSetCoercion, fixCallArgTypesInBody guards) compounded the null deref problem.

**KEY FINDING**: Each change was individually net positive but their interaction was net negative. Full test262 is mandatory after EACH merge, not just at the end.

**BETTER APPROACH**: Fix illegal_cast at codegen time (emit correct types) rather than post-hoc repair passes. The guarded cast approach is inherently fragile — it converts compile errors to runtime traps.

**MUST**: Run full test262 after merging main into the feature branch, before merging back to main.

## Test Results (Change 1 only)

**Changes made:**
- `src/codegen/stack-balance.ts` line 700: `ref.cast` -> `ref.cast_null` in `fixBranchType` externref->ref path
- `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` line 2185: `ref.cast` -> `ref.cast_null` in `coercionInstrs` no-fctx externref->ref fallback

**Sample test results:**
- `initialization-returns-normal-completion-for-empty-objects.js` => PASS (was illegal_cast)
- `ary-init-iter-close.js` => still illegal_cast (different root cause: iterator type mismatch)
- `10.6-6-3.js` => still illegal_cast (different root cause: arguments object type)

1/3 sample tests fixed by this change. This is expected — Change 1 targets the subset where null/undefined externref values were being cast with bare `ref.cast` (traps on null). The remaining failures need different fixes (Change 2/3 or codegen-level fixes).

**Equivalence tests:** No regressions (all failures are pre-existing helpers.js/string_constants issues).

## Test Results (Change 2: probe-compile receiver type override)

**Changes made:**
- `src/codegen/array-methods.ts`: Added probe-compile in `compileArrayMethodCall` to detect when the receiver's actual Wasm type differs from what `resolveArrayInfo` predicts. When a literal array like `[0, true]` creates `__vec_f64` but the TS type resolves to `__vec_externref`, the probe detects the mismatch and overrides `vecTypeIdx/arrTypeIdx/elemType` before dispatching to any method function.
- Simplified `setupArrayLoop` to trust the caller's corrected types instead of doing its own type detection.

**Approach:** Fast path checks local/global Wasm type for identifier receivers. Slow path probe-compiles the expression (then rolls back the body) to determine actual type for literal/complex receivers.

**Sample test results (post-merge with private/main):**
- `15.4.4.15-5-8.js` (lastIndexOf) => PASS (was illegal_cast)
- `15.4.4.16-7-b-1.js` (every) => FAIL returned 2 (was illegal_cast — no longer traps)
- `15.4.4.14-10-1.js` (indexOf) => FAIL returned 3 (was illegal_cast — no longer traps)
- `this-value-valid-date.js` => PASS
- `10.6-6-3.js` => still illegal_cast (arguments object — different root cause)
- `const-ary-ptrn-rest-id-iter-val-err.js` => still illegal_cast (iterator destructuring — different root cause)

**Impact:** Fixes array method illegal_cast failures where the root cause is vec type mismatch between construction-time inference and call-time type resolution. Remaining illegal_cast failures are non-array patterns (arguments object, iterator protocol, private fields) requiring separate fixes.
