# #423 — Invalid field index in struct access (36 CE)

## Problem

36 tests fail with "invalid field index: 0" errors when subclassing built-in types (Array, Error, Map, etc.). The compiler generates a struct with zero fields, then any code accessing field 0 (e.g., __tag for instanceof) causes a Wasm validation error.

Root cause: When `class Sub extends Array`, `parentClassName` is set to "Array" but `parentStructTypeIdx` is undefined (built-ins have no Wasm struct). The guard `if (!parentClassName)` prevents adding the `__tag` field, leaving the struct empty.

## Priority: medium (36 tests across 18 unique test files)

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Correct __tag field for subclasses of built-in types
- [x] Correct field offset calculation for inherited fields
- [x] Reduce "invalid field index" CEs to zero

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Fixed the `__tag` field guard in `registerClass` (src/codegen/index.ts) to also add `__tag` when the parent class has no Wasm struct type (i.e., built-in classes like Array, Error, Map, etc.).

The one-line fix changes the condition from:
```
if (!parentClassName)
```
to:
```
if (!parentClassName || parentStructTypeIdx === undefined)
```

This ensures that classes extending built-ins are treated as root classes for struct purposes, getting their own `__tag` field instead of inheriting a nonexistent one.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — guard condition in `registerClass`
- `tests/equivalence/struct-field-index.test.ts` — new test file with 4 test cases

### What worked
- Simple, targeted fix addressing the root cause
- All 36 "invalid field index: 0" CEs from subclass-builtins tests resolved

### What didn't
- Dynamic field addition (separate issue) still mutates type definitions after constructor compilation
