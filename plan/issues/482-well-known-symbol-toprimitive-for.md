# #482 — Well-known Symbol.toPrimitive for type coercion (113 tests)

## Status: in-progress

113 tests use `Symbol.toPrimitive` — the protocol for custom type coercion (`+obj`, `${obj}`, `obj == 42`).

## Approach

Same pattern as #481: compile-time resolution of a well-known symbol.

1. When a class defines `[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)`, compile it as `@@toPrimitive` struct method (already handled by `resolveComputedKeyExpression` mapping `Symbol.toPrimitive` to `@@toPrimitive`)
2. In type coercion paths (arithmetic, string concatenation, comparison), check if the object has a `@@toPrimitive` method and call it with the appropriate hint ("number", "string", "default")
3. This replaces the existing valueOf/toString coercion path when toPrimitive is present

## Complexity: M (depends on #481 for the infrastructure)

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `class C { [Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) { return 42; } }` compiles
- [x] `+new C()` calls toPrimitive with hint "number"
- [x] `${new C()}` calls toPrimitive with hint "string"

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added `@@toPrimitive` dispatch to the `coerceType` function in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`, at two coercion paths:

1. **ref/ref_null -> externref** (string coercion): Before checking for `toString()`, checks for `ClassName_@@toPrimitive` method and calls it with hint "string". Handles return type coercion (f64/i32 -> externref via `__box_number`, ref -> externref via `extern.convert_any`).

2. **ref/ref_null -> f64** (numeric coercion): Before checking for `valueOf()`, checks for `ClassName_@@toPrimitive` method and calls it with hint "number". Handles return type coercion (i32 -> f64 via `f64.convert_i32_s`, externref -> f64 via `__unbox_number`).

The `resolveComputedKeyExpression` already maps `Symbol.toPrimitive` to `@@toPrimitive`, and class method compilation already uses this resolved name via `resolveClassMemberName`, so the method is registered as `ClassName_@@toPrimitive` in `ctx.funcMap`.

Hint strings ("number", "string") are lazily registered as string constants via `addStringConstantGlobal` before being emitted.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — added @@toPrimitive checks in coerceType (ref->externref and ref->f64 paths)
- `tests/equivalence/symbol-toPrimitive.test.ts` — new test file with 4 tests

### Tests now passing
- Symbol.toPrimitive with number hint via unary +
- Symbol.toPrimitive with arithmetic
- Symbol.toPrimitive takes precedence over valueOf
- Symbol.toPrimitive with comparison operators
