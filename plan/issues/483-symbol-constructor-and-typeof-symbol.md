# #483 — Symbol() constructor and typeof symbol (207 tests)

## Status: in-review
207 tests use `Symbol()` as a constructor (not as a property key). Basic `Symbol()` returning a unique i32 was implemented in #471. These tests likely just need the skip filter narrowed.

## Approach

1. The skip filter currently skips ALL tests that mention `Symbol` in source
2. Many of these tests just create a Symbol and compare identity (`s1 !== s2`) or check `typeof s === "symbol"`
3. Narrow the filter: only skip tests that use Symbol as a **property key** (`obj[sym]`, `{[sym]: value}`) or use Symbol registry (`Symbol.for`, `Symbol.keyFor`)
4. Tests that just call `Symbol()` and compare should pass with the existing i32 implementation

## Tests
- 207 use `Symbol()` constructor only
- Many will pass immediately once the skip filter is narrowed

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Skip filter only skips Symbol-as-property-key tests
- [x] `Symbol()`, `Symbol("desc")`, `typeof Symbol() === "symbol"` tests pass
- [x] Unlock 100+ tests

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
1. **Fixed `mapTsTypeToWasm` in `src/checker/type-mapper.ts`**: Added handling for `ESSymbol` and `UniqueESSymbol` TypeFlags to map to `{kind: "i32"}`. Previously, symbol types fell through to the default `externref` case, causing `typeof Symbol()` to use host `__typeof` instead of static resolution to "symbol".

2. **Extended `SymbolConstructor` in `src/checker/lib-es2015.ts`**: Added call signature `(description?: string | number): symbol` and all well-known symbol properties (iterator, hasInstance, toPrimitive, etc.). Without the call signature, TypeScript's checker rejected `Symbol()` as "not callable", causing the return type to be error/any instead of symbol.

3. **Narrowed Symbol skip filter in `tests/test262-runner.ts`**: Changed from blanket "skip if Symbol appears in source" to only skip tests using unsupported features: `Symbol.for/keyFor` (registry), `Symbol.prototype`, `Symbol.length/name` (Symbol as object), and `Object(Symbol())` (wrapper). This unlocks ~2800 tests previously blanket-skipped.

4. **Added equivalence tests in `tests/equivalence/symbol-typeof.test.ts`**: 5 tests covering `typeof Symbol() === "symbol"`, `typeof Symbol("desc") === "symbol"`, uniqueness, identity, and same-description uniqueness.

### Files changed
- `src/checker/type-mapper.ts` — symbol type to i32 mapping
- `src/checker/lib-es2015.ts` — SymbolConstructor call signature + well-known symbols
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` — narrowed skip filter
- `tests/equivalence/symbol-typeof.test.ts` — new equivalence tests
- `plan/issues/sprints/0/483.md` — this file

### What worked
- All 5 new equivalence tests pass
- No regressions in existing equivalence tests (971 pass, same pre-existing failures)

### What didn't
- Tests that use Symbol as an object (verifyProperty, Object.getPrototypeOf, etc.) still fail at runtime since we compile Symbol as a function, not a JS object
