# #891 — Apply test262 infrastructure learnings to equivalence tests

## Status: review-failed

## Problem

Equivalence tests currently compile and execute in-process within the vitest fork. As test count grows (~170 now, increasing every sprint), memory accumulates from TypeScript compiler state and Wasm instances. Every dev agent runs equiv tests after each change, so this is on the critical path.

The test262 runner solved this with:
- **CompilerPool** — child_process.fork workers with 512MB heap cap
- **Memory isolation** — fork dies → OS reclaims ALL memory (RSS, JIT, etc.)
- **Parallel compile+execute** — pool dispatches to N workers concurrently
- **Timestamped results** — no overwriting, every run preserved

## Proposed changes

1. **Fork-based compilation**: Use CompilerPool for equivalence tests. Each test compiles+executes in an isolated fork.
2. **Parallel execution**: `availableParallelism() - 2` workers (leave headroom for agent + system).
3. **Memory cap**: Each fork worker limited to 512MB, preventing accumulation.
4. **flock serialization**: Use same lockfile as test262 (`/tmp/js2wasm-test262.lock`). Only ONE test suite (test262 OR equiv) runs at a time, but with full CPU.
5. **Single instance**: flock prevents concurrent equiv test runs across agents. If locked, wait or fail fast.
6. **Small batches**: Run in batches so memory stays flat. Fork pool already handles this (fork dies → OS reclaims).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Equivalence tests use fork workers (not in-process compilation)
- [ ] Memory stays flat regardless of test count (no accumulation)
- [ ] flock on `/tmp/js2wasm-test262.lock` — serializes with test262 runs
- [ ] Only 1 equiv test run at a time (flock enforced)
- [ ] Test runtime is equal or faster than current in-process approach
- [ ] All existing equiv tests still pass

## Review Feedback

**Result**: FAIL
**Stage**: Equivalence tests (Stage 2)
**Details**:
- 173 fail / 1048 pass (1221 total) with fork pool active
- 13 NEW regressions: all tagged template literal tests in `ts-wasm-equivalence.test.ts`
- Error: `CompileError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Compiling function #N:"test1" failed: return_call[0] expected type (ref null N), found local.get of type (ref null N-1)`
- Root cause: `scripts/compiler-bundle.mjs` has a pre-existing bug — the bundled compiler assigns different WasmGC type indices for template literal string arrays vs in-process compilation
- Both main's bundle AND branch's bundle reproduce the bug; main's equiv tests pass only because they use in-process compilation (no pool)
- Fork workers use the bundle → expose the bug

**Severity**: moderate — the approach is sound (fork pool for isolation), but fork workers must not use the pre-built esbuild bundle for compilation. Options:
1. Fork workers use `npx tsx` to run the in-process compiler (avoid the bundle entirely)
2. Investigate and fix why esbuild bundling shifts WasmGC type indices for tagged templates

**Branch**: `issue-891-equiv-pool` (worktree: `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-891-equiv-pool`)
**Merge commit**: `da839f94` (main already merged in — no need to re-merge)
