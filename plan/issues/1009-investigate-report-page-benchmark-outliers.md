# #1009 -- Investigate report-page benchmark outliers where Wasm is much slower than JS

## Status: open

The benchmark section on `public/benchmarks/report.html` currently highlights
several cases where the Wasm implementation is much slower than native JS.
Those slowdowns are visible to users on the public report page, but they are
not yet systematically explained or bucketed.

This issue is for analysis first, not for a single predetermined compiler fix.
The goal is to separate:

- expected host-boundary costs
- benchmark artifacts or measurement noise
- startup/load-vs-runtime confusion
- genuine codegen/runtime regressions
- cases where the benchmark itself is not representative

## Problem

We currently have benchmark examples on the report page where Wasm loses badly
against JS, but there is no structured investigation that explains:

1. which slowdowns are dominated by host interop
2. which are caused by generic lowering choices
3. which are measurement artifacts
4. which are real optimization opportunities worth prioritizing in Sprint 40

Without that analysis, the report page shows real numbers but not an informed
interpretation of why those numbers look bad.

## Scope

Investigate the report-page benchmarks with special attention to examples where
Wasm is significantly slower than JS. At minimum include:

- the per-example runtime-speed chart
- the per-example loading-speed chart where relevant
- the generated WAT / Wasm structure for the worst outliers
- whether the benchmark uses host JS strings, host DOM, generic array wrappers,
  or other obviously expensive lowering paths

## Investigation questions

### 1. Which benchmarks are the worst outliers?

Identify the report-page examples where Wasm is substantially slower than JS,
for example:

- host-call dominated cases
- string-heavy cases
- array/GC-wrapper cases
- DOM or style mutation cases

### 2. What is the dominant cause per outlier?

For each major outlier, classify the slowdown as primarily:

- host boundary overhead
- missing specialization
- poor data-structure lowering
- repeated helper/runtime calls
- compile configuration mismatch
- benchmark design artifact

### 3. Is the slowdown in runtime, loading, or both?

Some cases may look bad in one chart but not the other. Separate:

- runtime execution slowness
- load/startup slowness
- shared-runtime or glue effects

### 4. What should become follow-up implementation issues?

Produce a short list of concrete follow-ups, such as:

- string concat lowering
- counted array preallocation
- host-call batching or specialization
- native-string / fast-path correctness fixes
- benchmark redesign when the current microbenchmark is misleading

## Deliverable

Create a concise analysis document or issue updates that, for each major report
benchmark outlier, states:

- the measured slowdown
- the likely root cause
- whether it is expected or a bug/regression
- the recommended next action

## Acceptance criteria

- the worst report-page benchmark outliers are enumerated explicitly
- each outlier has a likely root-cause classification
- runtime-vs-loading effects are separated where relevant
- at least one concrete follow-up issue is created or linked for each important
  genuine optimization opportunity
- the analysis clearly distinguishes benchmark artifacts from real compiler or
  runtime shortcomings
