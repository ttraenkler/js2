# #1095 — Eliminate `as unknown as Instr` casts (273 sites)

## Source

External compiler engineer review (2026-04-12): "I counted 273 `as unknown as Instr` sites under `src/`. That is a real signal of compiler-internal type model drift, not just cosmetic debt."

Also noted: `dead-elimination.ts` needs a catch-all for instructions that were forced through with casts, which weakens the dead-code elimination pass.

## Problem

The `Instr` type union in the compiler's IR does not cover all Wasm opcodes that the codegen actually emits. When codegen needs an opcode not in the union, it uses `as unknown as Instr` to bypass TypeScript's type checker. This has several consequences:

1. **No exhaustiveness checking** — switch/match over `Instr` can silently miss cases
2. **Dead-elimination fragility** — `dead-elimination.ts:77` has a catch-all because it can't enumerate all instruction shapes
3. **Peephole pass blindness** — pattern matching in `peephole.ts` can't see cast-through opcodes
4. **Refactoring risk** — renaming or restructuring an opcode won't trigger type errors at cast sites

Current count: **273 occurrences across 26 files** (verified 2026-04-12).

## Approach

1. **Inventory**: grep all `as unknown as Instr` sites, extract the actual opcode string/shape being cast
2. **Extend Instr union**: add missing opcode types to the IR type definition
3. **Remove casts**: replace each `as unknown as Instr` with the now-typed opcode
4. **Fix downstream**: update dead-elimination, peephole, and any other IR consumers to handle new variants
5. **Add lint rule**: eslint/tsc config to flag new `as unknown as Instr` usage

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Instr union covers all opcodes the codegen actually emits
- [ ] `as unknown as Instr` count reduced from 273 to ≤50 (stretch: 0)
- [ ] dead-elimination.ts catch-all narrowed or removed
- [ ] No regressions: equivalence tests pass
- [ ] CI lint rule prevents new cast-through additions without updating the union

## Complexity

L (>400 lines touched across 26 files, but each change is mechanical)

## Related

- CLAUDE.md mentions 158 occurrences as of an earlier count — now 273, confirming drift
- #1013 codegen/index.ts split (reduces per-file cast density but doesn't fix the type model)

## Sprint-62 planning amendment (2026-06-12)

Re-scoped from big-bang union extension to a **ratchet**: current count is
175 sites in 13 files (was 273/26 when filed; organic decay works). Sprint
62 lands the mechanism only — `scripts/check-instr-casts.mjs` + committed
baseline + `quality`-job wiring (clone of `check:ir-fallbacks`); growth
fails CI, decreases auto-bank with `--update-on-decrease`. The remaining
union extension is sprint-63 mop-up. Status reset from stale `in-review`
(sprint 45) to `ready`.
