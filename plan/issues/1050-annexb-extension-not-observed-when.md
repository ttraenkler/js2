# #1050 — annexB: Extension not observed when variable binding would produce early error

## Problem

AnnexB B.3.2.1 (FunctionDeclarationInstantiation with web-compat var hoisting) tests expect the web-compat extension to NOT create a hoisted `var` binding when doing so would produce an early error (e.g. a name clash with a lexical binding in an enclosing scope). Our eval-code path throws a runtime null/undefined TypeError because it tried to honor the hoisting even when the binding should be suppressed.

## Evidence from harvest

- **Test count:** 110 tests currently failing with this pattern
- **Top path buckets:**
  - `40 test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/*`
  - `40 test/annexB/language/eval-code/indirect/*`
- **Top error messages:**
  - 52× `TypeError (null/undefined access): Extension not observed when creation of variable binding would produce an early error`
- **Sample test files:**
  - `test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/global-block-decl-eval-global-skip-early-err-block.js`
  - `test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/global-if-decl-else-stmt-eval-global-skip-early-err-switch.js`
  - `test/annexB/language/eval-code/direct/global-if-decl-no-else-eval-global-skip-early-err-block.js`

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§B.3.2 Block-Level Function Declarations Web Legacy Compatibility Semantics](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-block-level-function-declarations-web-legacy-compatibility-semantics) — Annex B function hoisting only applies when it would not produce an early error


## Root cause hypothesis

The compiler currently unconditionally materializes the B.3.2 hoisted `var` binding. It is missing the early-error detection step ("Extension not observed" rule) that skips the hoisting when a conflicting lexical binding exists.

## Fix

In the eval-code/AnnexB var-hoisting path, pre-scan enclosing lexical scopes for conflicts and suppress the extension (no hoisted binding created) when the spec's early-error check would fire.

## Expected impact

~110 FAIL across annexB eval-code tests.

## Key files

- src/codegen/statements.ts (eval-code B.3.2 hoist)
- scope-resolution code paths

## Source

Filed by `harvester-post-sprint-40-merge` 2026-04-11 against the post-merge Sprint 40 main baseline (`benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl`, 43,164 records).

## Actual Root Cause

The harvester's hypothesis ("B.3.2 hoisting needs early-error suppression") was misdirected. Tests use `eval('{...}')` whose contents our compiler never compiles — eval() bodies are opaque string literals to us. The real failure: the test harness assertions around the eval call include `typeof f !== "undefined"` where `f` is an undeclared identifier at module level. Per ES spec, `typeof` on an **unresolvable Reference** must return `"undefined"` without throwing. Our compiler was compiling the bare identifier access (which throws at runtime) and then applying `typeof` to it.

## Implementation

Fix in `src/codegen/typeof-delete.ts` — both `compileTypeofExpression` and `compileTypeofComparison`:

1. Unwrap the operand through parens / `as` / `!` / type-assertion.
2. If it resolves to a bare `Identifier` whose `checker.getSymbolAtLocation()` returns no `valueDeclaration`, emit the static string `"undefined"` (or the constant comparison result) instead of compiling the operand.
3. This matches ES spec `TypeOfExpression`: if the operand is an unresolvable Reference, return `"undefined"` without evaluating.

Bare identifier access outside `typeof` still throws at runtime — non-regression test covers that.

## Test Results

- **Target cluster** (annexB eval-code `*-skip-early-err-*`): **160/168 PASS** (was ~0/110 before fix — the 110 bucket in the harvester report is now essentially cleared; 8 residual FAIL are unrelated annexB edge cases).
- **Full annexB eval-code bucket**: TOTAL=469 PASS=292 FAIL=128 CE=0 RUN=49 (large jump from baseline).
- **Non-regression — `language/expressions/typeof`**: 11/16 PASS (residuals unrelated, pre-existing).
- **Direct samples from issue**:
  - `global-block-decl-eval-global-skip-early-err-block.js` → PASS
  - `global-if-decl-else-stmt-eval-global-skip-early-err-switch.js` → PASS
  - `global-if-decl-no-else-eval-global-skip-early-err-block.js` → PASS
- **Scoped `tests/issue-1050.test.ts`**: 4/4 PASS (covers `===`/`!==`, try-wrap, bare-ref still throws).
