# #916 -- Clean contributor-facing repo hygiene and remove misleading clutter

## Problem

The repo currently contains several signals that make it feel less curated than it should:

- temporary-looking files under `tests/`
- placeholder files such as `src/codegen/functions.ts` and `src/codegen/structs.ts`
- generated or local-debug artifacts that make it harder to tell what is canonical

Even when the underlying compiler is serious, this kind of clutter reduces trust for potential contributors.

## Goal

Make the repository feel intentionally maintained by removing or isolating files that look accidental, local-only, or architecturally misleading.

## Requirements

1. Remove or relocate committed temp/debug files from contributor-facing test folders
2. Extend ignore rules so local scratch files do not recur
3. Delete or properly populate placeholder architecture files
4. Keep generated artifacts clearly separated from hand-maintained source where they must remain committed
5. Leave the repo in a state where a newcomer can tell which files are authoritative

## Acceptance criteria

- obvious temp/debug clutter is gone
- placeholder files no longer mislead contributors about subsystem ownership
- repo trust improves before anyone reads deep compiler code
