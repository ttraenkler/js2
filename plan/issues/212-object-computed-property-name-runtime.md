# Issue #212: Object computed property name runtime failures

## Status: in-review
## Problem
15 test262 failures in `language/expressions/object` for computed property names.
Tests use `var obj = { [expression]: value }` where the computed key is an arithmetic/ternary/logical expression.
The objects are created but property access via computed key returns wrong value (0 instead of expected).

## Root Cause
Three issues combined:
1. `resolveComputedKeyExpression` only handled simple cases (string/numeric literals, const vars, enums).
   It did not support arithmetic expressions, ternary, exponentiation, or boolean literals.
2. `resolveWasmType` returned `externref` for object literal types with 0 TS-resolved properties,
   causing the variable to be stored as `externref` instead of a struct ref.
3. The pre-pass registered `__extern_get` import for element access on object literal types
   that would actually be compiled as structs.

## Fix
1. Enhanced `resolveConstantExpression` with exponentiation (`**`), boolean literals, and conditional (ternary) expressions.
2. Added `resolveConstantExpression` as fallback in `resolveComputedKeyExpression`.
3. Added `ensureComputedPropertyFields` helper to augment struct types with fields from computed property expressions.
4. Added special case in `compileVariableStatement` for object literals with computed property names.
5. Skip `__extern_get` import registration for `__type`/`__object` symbol types.

## Files Changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`
- `src/codegen/statements.ts`
- `src/codegen/index.ts`
- `tests/equivalence.test.ts`
