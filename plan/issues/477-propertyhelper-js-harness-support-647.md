# #477 — propertyHelper.js harness support (647 tests)

647 tests are skipped because they require `propertyHelper.js`. Issue #309 added stubs for some harness includes but propertyHelper.js was not included. Add no-op stubs for `verifyProperty`, `verifyEnumerable`, `verifyWritable`, `verifyConfigurable` etc. — tests that also check values will still be meaningful even without descriptor verification.

## Implementation Summary

Most of the propertyHelper.js stubs were already in place (verifyProperty, verifyEnumerable, verifyNotEnumerable, verifyWritable, verifyNotWritable, verifyConfigurable, verifyNotConfigurable) and propertyHelper.js was already in the allowed includes set. The missing stubs were `verifyEqualTo` and `verifyNotEqualTo`.

**What was done:**
- Added no-op stubs for `verifyEqualTo(a, b, c)` and `verifyNotEqualTo(a, b, c)` following the existing conditional-include pattern in `wrapTest()`

**Files changed:**
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` — added verifyEqualTo and verifyNotEqualTo stubs
