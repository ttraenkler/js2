# Issue 83: Test262 conformance subset

## Summary

Integrate a filtered subset of the official ECMAScript Test262 conformance
suite to validate ts2wasm's language feature coverage against the spec.

## Motivation

Our current tests verify features work in isolation. Test262 tests are the
canonical definition of correct behavior — they catch edge cases, boundary
conditions, and spec-compliance issues that hand-written tests miss. Running
even a subset gives high confidence that our implementations match the spec.

## What is Test262

- **Repository**: `github.com/tc39/test262`
- **~50,000 tests** covering every ECMAScript feature
- **Format**: Each test is a standalone JS file with metadata comments
  (`/*--- ... ---*/`) specifying expected behavior, flags, and features
- **Harness**: Test262 provides `assert.js` and `sta.js` helper files

## Approach

### Phase 1: Test selection and annotation

Not all Test262 tests are compilable — many use dynamic features (eval,
prototype chains, with statements, Proxy) that wasm can't support. Filter to
tests that use only our supported subset:

**Include** (directories to scan):
- `test/built-ins/Math/` — Math methods (abs, floor, ceil, round, etc.)
- `test/built-ins/Number/` — Number.isNaN, isFinite, isInteger, etc.
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/` — map, filter, reduce, indexOf, etc.
- `test/built-ins/String/prototype/` — substring, indexOf, trim, etc.
- `test/language/expressions/addition/` — arithmetic operators
- `test/language/expressions/comparison/` — comparison operators
- `test/language/statements/for/` — for loops
- `test/language/statements/while/` — while loops
- `test/language/statements/if/` — conditionals

**Exclude** (features we don't support):
- Tests with `features: [Symbol]`, `features: [Proxy]`, `features: [WeakRef]`
- Tests using `eval`, `Function()`, `arguments`, `with`
- Tests requiring `Reflect`, `Object.defineProperty`, prototype mutation
- Tests with `flags: [async]` (until our async is more mature)
- Tests with `negative` metadata (expected parse/runtime errors)

### Phase 2: Auto-annotation with JSDoc

Test262 tests are plain JS. Since we now support JS compilation (#80), we
can compile them directly. However, TS inference may not always resolve types.

Strategy:
1. Try compiling the test with `allowJs: true` — TS infers types
2. If compilation fails due to unresolved `any`, skip that test
3. Track pass/fail/skip counts

### Phase 3: Test runner

```typescript
// tests/test262.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { compile } from "../src/index.js";
import { buildImports } from "../src/runtime.js";
import { readFileSync, readdirSync } from "fs";

const TEST262_DIR = "test262/test";
const CATEGORIES = ["built-ins/Math", "built-ins/Number", ...];

for (const category of CATEGORIES) {
  describe(`test262: ${category}`, () => {
    const files = findTestFiles(`${TEST262_DIR}/${category}`);
    for (const file of files) {
      if (shouldSkip(file)) continue;
      it(file.name, async () => {
        const source = readFileSync(file.path, "utf-8");
        const wrapped = wrapTest262(source); // Add exports, strip harness
        const result = compile(wrapped, { allowJs: true, fileName: "test.js" });
        if (!result.success) return; // skip uncompilable
        // instantiate and run...
      });
    }
  });
}
```

### Phase 4: Conformance dashboard

Generate a report showing:
- Total tests per category
- Passed / failed / skipped / uncompilable
- Percentage conformance per feature area

## File structure

```
test262/                    — git submodule of tc39/test262
tests/test262-runner.ts     — test runner and harness adapter
tests/test262.test.ts       — vitest integration
tests/test262-skip.json     — list of tests to skip (with reasons)
docs/test262-report.md      — generated conformance report
```

## Implementation phases

1. **Phase 1** — Add test262 as git submodule, build filter script, identify
   compilable subset (~200-500 tests initially)
2. **Phase 2** — Build vitest runner, get Math/Number tests passing
3. **Phase 3** — Expand to Array/String method tests
4. **Phase 4** — Conformance dashboard and CI integration

## Status

**Phase 1+2 complete.** Test262 added as git submodule. Runner and vitest integration
built with:
- Metadata parsing and feature-based filtering
- assert.sameValue/notSameValue/assert shims with NaN-aware comparison
- 3rd argument (message string) stripping
- Conformance report printed after each run

### Current results (21 Math categories, 210 tests):

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Passed | 87 |
| Failed | 1 |
| Compile errors | 38 |
| Skipped (metadata) | 84 |
| **Conformance (of compilable)** | **98%** |

20 of 21 categories at **100%** pass rate.

### Fixes applied:
- **Math.clz32**: Added `__toUint32` host import (`x >>> 0`) for spec-compliant ToUint32
- **Math.sign**: Rewrote with NaN check, zero check, and `f64.copysign` for -0 preservation
- **Math.imul**: Added `__toUint32` for proper unsigned truncation
- **Unary `+`**: Added PlusToken support (no-op in wasm, everything already numeric)
- **Number constants**: Added EPSILON, POSITIVE_INFINITY, NEGATIVE_INFINITY as compile-time constants

### Remaining failure:
- **Math.round S15.8.2.15_A6**: `var` hoisting across for-loops — general compiler limitation

### Remaining compile errors (38):
- Tests using `Math.max(...)` / `Math.min(...)` with array iteration patterns
- Tests with string arguments to Math methods (type coercion)
- `var` hoisting across multiple scopes

## Complexity

M — The runner itself is ~200 lines. The bulk of work is curating the test
list and fixing edge cases exposed by the tests. Initial setup is a few hours;
ongoing value is enormous.

## Dependencies

| Issue | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **#78** | Standard library — more builtins = more tests pass |
| **#80** | JS compilation — Test262 tests are plain JS |
