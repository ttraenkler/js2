# #3468 — Standalone method-dispatch "exception swallow" (root-caused)

> **Folds under #2860** (standalone↔host gap umbrella); cross-refs #3417
> (oracle-v8 reclassification). Origin: the Cluster C / C1 finding in the
> host↔standalone parity investigation (`/workspace/.tmp/parity-findings.md`).

## STATUS: root-caused, BLOCKED ON A SCOPING + FLOOR-REBASELINE DECISION

The bug is confirmed and multiply-reproduced. **But the root cause is NOT what
the parity investigation hypothesised, and the real fix is a substantial
feature, not a targeted exception-wiring change.** This issue therefore needs a
scoping decision (which approach) and a stakeholder floor-rebaseline decision
(the fix changes the standalone floor) before implementation. No PR is open;
no red regression test is committed (it cannot merge until the floor is
re-baselined).

## Confirmed symptom (real test262 pipeline)

Under `--target standalone` with the **exact** test262-worker compile options
(`allowJs:true, skipSemanticDiagnostics:true`, JS source, `(start)`-init model),
the test262 `assert` harness silently no-ops:

| Probe | Expected | Standalone actual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assert.sameValue(1, 2, "m")` | THROW `Test262Error` | **no throw** (vacuous pass) |
| `assert.throws(TypeError, ()=>{})` | THROW | **no throw** (vacuous pass) |
| `assert.sameValue(2, 2)` | no throw | no throw (correct) |

`assert` is a function object; `assert.sameValue`/`assert.throws`/`_isSameValue`
are properties assigned to it. Because those properties are **dropped**, the
call resolves to `undefined` and the assertion's `throw` never executes → the
test is scored a **VACUOUS PASS**.

## Root cause (corrected — this overturns the investigation's hypothesis)

**Function objects (closures) cannot carry own properties under `--target
standalone`.** Assigning a property to a callable value is dropped, and reading
it back yields `undefined`, so a "method" call on a function object never
invokes anything.

Decisive, unconfounded evidence (probes in the worktree `.tmp/`):

- `f.m = fn` then `f.m()` where `f` is a function -> returns **undefined**, not
  the method's value. Distinctive-return probe: method returns `777`, call site
  reads `0` (undefined). Plain-object control `o.m = fn; o.m()` correctly reads
  `777`.
- Side-effect probe: a global written **inside** the method stays at its initial
  value -> **the method body never executes**. The `throw` is never reached
  because the call never happens.
- `f.x = 5; return f.x` on a function object -> **NaN** (undefined). Plain-object
  control returns `5`.
- **The generated WAT contains ZERO `try`/`catch`/`catch_all`.** There is no
  exception being caught and dropped. The investigation's hypothesis — "the
  method-dispatch export wrapper in `closure-exports.ts` saves/restores
  `__current_this` around `call_ref` with no `catch_all`, so add one + rethrow"
  — is **wrong**: no exception ever propagates out of the (never-invoked)
  method, so a `catch_all`+rethrow there would be a **no-op**. Do NOT implement
  that fix.
- The investigation's "`assert._isSameValue("a","b")` returns false correctly,
  so the comparison works" claim was a **false positive**: an un-invoked method
  returns `undefined`, which is falsy, so `... ? 1 : 0` yields `0` — the same as
  a real `false`. A distinctive-value re-test shows `_isSameValue` is **not**
  invoked either.

### Why `__extern_method_call` returns undefined on a function receiver

`a.m(args)` on an `any`-typed receiver lowers to
`__extern_method_call(recv, "m", args)` (`src/codegen/object-runtime.ts` ~3979).
Its dispatch is `ref.test $Object(recv)` -> on match, resolve via `__extern_get`
+ `__apply_closure`; **else return `ref.null.extern` (undefined)**. A closure is
NOT a `$Object`, so the `ref.test` fails and the whole call returns undefined.
Symmetrically, `__extern_get`/`__extern_set` (~1409) gate on `ref.test $Object`
and miss on closures, so both property read and write on a function value are
no-ops.

### What already works (bounds the fix)

- **`.prototype`** assignment/read persists through `new` — there is a dedicated
  prototype slot, not general own-property storage.
- **Class static methods** (`class C { static m() {} }; C.m()`) work — but via
  **compile-time** resolution (static members become module globals +
  tag-dispatch, `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts:800/1450`,
  `class-member-keys.ts`), NOT a runtime callable-carries-properties
  representation.
- There is **no general runtime mechanism** for "a callable value carries
  arbitrary own properties." That is exactly what is missing.

## Candidate approaches (for the scoping decision)

**A. Compile-time function-object property tracking (targeted, mirrors class
statics).** Track properties assigned to module-level function *declarations*
(`assert.sameValue = fn`) into a compile-time map, and statically resolve
`X.prop(...)` / `X.prop` where `X` is such a declaration to a direct call/read.
- Covers the dominant case: the test262 `assert` harness is a module-level
  `function assert(){}` with statically-named method assignments and statically-
  named call sites — all resolvable at compile time.
- Does NOT cover dynamically-aliased function objects (`const g = assert; g.x`)
  or property access on function *values* flowing through `any`.
- Effort: **medium**. Risk: **moderate** (new static-resolution path; must not
  regress the existing `__extern_method_call` dynamic path).

**B. Runtime callable-`$Object` representation (general).** Box a
property-carrying function into a callable `$Object` (internal callable slot) so
`__extern_get`/`_set`/`__extern_method_call` work uniformly and dispatch invokes
through the slot.
- Fully general. Touches value representation, closure classification, `typeof`,
  and call lowering. Effort: **large**. Risk: **high** (broad-impact; validate
  on `merge_group`).

**C. Closure-identity-keyed side property table (general, less invasive to value
rep).** Keep closures as-is; give `__extern_set`/`_get`/`__extern_method_call` a
fallback that stores/looks up properties in a runtime identity-keyed map when the
receiver is a closure rather than a `$Object`.
- More general than A, less invasive than B. Needs closure identity + a global
  map + method-dispatch routing through it. Effort: **medium-high**. Risk:
  **medium**.

**Recommendation:** this is architect-spec territory. Approach **A** is the most
tractable path to unblocking the test262 `assert` harness (the dominant value);
**C** is the general fallback if aliased function objects matter. Route through
`/architect-spec` before implementation.

## Floor / #2860 metric impact (corrected narrative)

The parity finding framed this as a **pure pass->fail lowering** ("~thousands of
vacuous passes become correct fails, lowering the floor to truth"). That is only
partly right — making assert methods callable is a **feature**, so the net floor
direction is **mixed**, not purely down:

- **should-FAIL tests** currently vacuous-pass -> will correctly **FAIL**
  (pass->fail; the "lowering"). This is the dominant flip and the reason the
  standalone-floor regression gate WILL trip on `merge_group`.
- **should-PASS tests** currently vacuous-pass -> still pass (now genuinely; no
  flip).
- Some tests failing **only** because an assert method wasn't callable may flip
  **fail->pass**.

Net is a truthful re-baseline, predominantly downward, but not one-directional.
The exact flip count must be **measured empirically on a representative subset
after the fix lands** (not computable a priori; do NOT run full test262 locally).
A **standalone-floor re-baseline** is required and gated on the stakeholder
decision (per the dispatching tech-lead's instruction: this fix must not
auto-land).

## Regression guard (to add WITH the fix, once floor is re-baselined)

A focused vitest under `tests/` asserting that on `--target standalone`:
- `assert.sameValue(1, 2)` **throws** (scores fail), and
- `assert.throws(TypeError, () => {})` **throws** (scores fail).

Not committed yet — it is a red test until the fix lands, and it cannot merge
before the floor re-baseline.

## Bug 2 (separate, smaller, optional): top-level `throw` statement dropped

Independent of the above: a `throw` statement at module top level is silently
elided from the standalone `(start)`/init body. `throw 42;` as the sole
top-level statement compiles to an empty ~5.6 KB module with **no `(start)`
section**. Verified it is **throw-only**, not whole-init DCE: `var g = 0;
function set(){ g = 7; } set(); throw 42;` runs the side effect (`g === 7`) but
still does not throw. Low test262 value (few tests end in a bare top-level
throw); offer as an optional standalone-correctness win, separate PR.

## Repro probes (durable)

In the worktree `.tmp/`: `repro.mjs`, `probe2.mjs`-`probe8.mjs`, `caseA.wat`,
`C_tail.wat`. All use `compile(src, { target: "standalone", ... })` and
`WebAssembly.instantiate`.

## Implementation Plan

> Recommendation: **Approach C** (runtime closure-identity side property table),
> phased **C-core → C-complete**. NOT A, NOT B. Verified against `origin/main`.

### Recommendation & why (C over A/B)

The three terminal dispatch helpers **already receive the closure receiver** as
an externref and simply bail in their "not a `$Object`" arm:

| Op | route | terminal helper (object-runtime.ts) | dead arm today |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `f.p = v` | `__set_member_p` | `__extern_set` | non-`$Object` arm → `return` (no-op) |
| `f.p` | `__get_member_p` | `__extern_get` | miss arm → undefined |
| `f.m()` | `__call_m_m_0` | `__extern_method_call` | else → `ref.null.extern` |

**C fills those three currently-dead arms for concrete capturing-closure
subtypes.** The `$Object` fast-path is untouched. Shared noncapturing wrapper
structs — including the test262 `assert` harness receiver — deliberately remain
outside this first rollout; the exact merge-group measurement below explains
why. The slice fixes real programs with aliased capturing receivers and reuses
the existing `$Object` prop machinery for per-closure own props.

### Phasing
- **C-core (this PR):** wire the 3 helpers + side table for capturing closures.
- **C-core rollout (blocked):** expand to shared noncapturing wrappers only after
  the assertion failures exposed by the merge-group measurement are fixed.
- **C-complete (follow-on):** route reflection (`in` / `delete` / ownKeys /
  `getOwnPropertyDescriptor`) through the same prop-bag.
- **A (optional):** compile-time fast-path for statically-named accesses.

### Changes — C-core (as implemented)

**1. Runtime structure** — struct
`$ClosurePropEntry { next: (mut ref null $ClosurePropEntry); key: eqref; bag: externref }`
+ module global `$__closure_prop_head : (mut ref null $ClosurePropEntry)` init
`ref.null`. Registered in `ensureObjectRuntime`'s type section, gated on
`ctx.standalone` (host/gc uses `env::__extern_*` imports → never touches these →
byte-identical). Linked list: prepend O(1), lookup = walk with `ref.eq`.

**2. Reserved-then-filled helpers** (mirror `reserveApplyClosure`/
`fillApplyClosure` — reserve funcIdx w/ `unreachable` stub at object-runtime-emit
time so the `__extern_*` bodies bake a stable `call <idx>`; fill at FINALIZE once
the captured-closure subtype set is complete; the late-import shifter keeps
`funcMap` + baked calls in sync). Guarded on the
`ctx.closurePropHelpersReserved` flag so a fill never runs without a reserve.
- `__is_closure_prop_carrier(externref)->i32` — `ref.test` chain over concrete
  closure structs whose source closure captured one or more lexical bindings.
- `__closure_bag_lookup(externref recv)->externref` — walk head; `ref.eq(key,
  recv-as-eqref)` → `bag`; miss → `ref.null.extern` (read; never creates).
- `__closure_bag_ensure(externref recv)->externref` — as lookup; on miss
  `bag=__new_plain_object()`, prepend entry, `global.set head`, return bag.
- `__closure_prop_get(obj,key)->externref` / `__closure_prop_set(obj,key,val)->()`
  — thin wrappers that self-call `__extern_get`/`__extern_set` on the bag.

> **Deviation from the sketch (WHY):** the spec sketched "3 helpers, inline the
> arm bodies." But the `set`/`get` arms need to self-call `__extern_set`/
> `__extern_get` on the bag, and a func's own funcIdx is **not** in `funcMap`
> while its body is being built (`registerNative` mints at registration time,
> after the body array is constructed). Routing the self-call through two extra
> reserved-and-filled wrappers (`__closure_prop_get`/`_set`, filled at FINALIZE
> when both `__extern_get`/`_set` funcIdxs ARE in `funcMap`) is the clean fix and
> avoids touching the registration of the two hottest object-runtime funcs.
> `__extern_method_call`'s else-arm is inlined directly (its deps — `extern_get`,
> `apply_closure` (reserved), `__nullish_to_null` — are all live at build time).

Receiver→eqref for `ref.eq`: `any.convert_extern` → `ref.cast EQ_HEAP_TYPE(-19)`.
Closures are eq-structs and `__is_closure_prop_carrier` guards every call, so
the cast is always safe.

**3–5. The three arms** now route their non-`$Object`/miss/else branch through
the helpers (`__closure_prop_set` / `__closure_prop_get` / inline closure mirror
guarded by `__is_closure_prop_carrier`). `.name`/`.length` `bfnGetMetaIdx`
meta-arm stays FIRST in `__extern_get`, so builtin metadata still answers before
the side-table fallback. `.prototype`/`.constructor`/`.__proto__` are
special-cased upstream and never reach these helpers.

**6. Finalize wiring** — `fillClosurePropHelpers(ctx)` next to `fillApplyClosure`
in `index.ts`.

### Floor interaction — exact measurement
The original all-closure rollout flipped vacuous standalone passes to truthful
failures and breached the standalone floor. The PR-shepherd measurement below
found 3,608 stable regressions, so no rebaseline or verdict exception is
permitted. This PR retains only the captured-closure boundary; #3468 stays
blocked for the shared-wrapper/harness rollout until the exposed semantics are
fixed.

### Test plan (vitest, target "standalone")
- Own-prop round-trip on a capturing arrow: `(memo as any).cache=5; ===5`.
- Method call + side effect: `(fn as any).m=()=>777; (fn as any).m()===777`.
- Aliasing/identity: `const g=fn; (g as any).x=5; (fn as any).x===5`.
- Distinct instances don't cross-talk; builtin `.name`/`.length` not shadowed.
- A shared noncapturing wrapper's custom property remains outside the rollout.

## C-core IMPLEMENTATION FINDING (2026-07-19) — runtime done, ROUTING GAP blocks the harness

C-core was implemented (`src/codegen/closure-props.ts` + the three arms in
`object-runtime.ts` + finalize wiring in `index.ts`) and the **runtime substrate
is verified correct** — but through the DYNAMIC member path only. A decisive gap
was found that **overturns the spec's "blast radius ≈ 0 / routing already works"
premise**:

**Verified working (dynamic path — a receiver flowing through an `any`-typed
local, e.g. `const g = fn`):**
- own-prop round-trip `(g as any).cache = 5; (g as any).cache` → `5`
- method call `(g as any).m = () => 777; (g as any).m()` → `777` (+ side effects run)
- identity `const g = fn; (g as any).x = 5; (fn as any).x` → `5` (`ref.eq` identity holds)
- distinct closures isolated → `11`, not `22`
- host/gc mode byte-identical (nothing emitted there); `--target standalone` only

**The gap — function-DECLARATION member ops bypass the dynamic path entirely:**
`assert.sameValue = fn`, `assert.sameValue`, `assert.sameValue(1,2)` (a bare
function-declaration receiver, which is EXACTLY the test262 `assert` harness
shape) are lowered STATICALLY against the closure-wrapper struct — WAT-confirmed:
the **write emits no runtime op** (silently dropped) and the **read resolves to
undefined** (`ref.cast (ref <wrapper>)` then no field). The real harness WAT
contains **zero** `__extern_*` / `__set_member` / `__closure_prop_*` calls, so the
filled arms are **unreachable for the harness**.

**Consequence: C-core as scoped yields floor delta ≈ 0.** The motivating vacuous
passes do NOT flip, because the assert harness never reaches the fixed arms. The
architect's "WAT-confirmed routes to `__extern_set`" held only for the local-alias
case, not the function-declaration case.

**To actually fix the harness** the front-end member dispatch must route a
function/closure receiver's NON-builtin member get/set/call to the dynamic path
(`__get_member`/`__set_member`/`__extern_method_call` → the C-core arms). Decision
points: `compilePropertyAccess` (`src/codegen/property-access.ts`) for reads; the
member-assignment lowering for writes; the method-call lowering for calls.
Exclusions to avoid regressions: `.name`/`.length`/`.call`/`.apply`/`.bind`/
`.prototype`/`.constructor`, class statics, and any statically-known member. This
is **A/front-end-routing territory** (deferred by this task's "C-core only"
scope) and its blast radius is NOT ≈0 — it changes how every function-value
member access lowers, so it needs full test262, not a canary. **Scope decision
pending with the tech-lead/stakeholder.** #3468 stays `blocked`.

## MEASUREMENT (2026-07-19) — routing is correct but BLOCKED by a pre-existing string-codegen bug

Ran a strided standalone before(`origin/main`)/after(branch) subset (730 files,
assert-heavy). Result — DO NOT read the raw flip count as the floor delta:

| | before(main) | after(branch) |
|---|---|---|
| pass | 446 | 55 |
| fail | 179 | 570 |
| compile_error | 26 | 26 |

- `pass → fail`: **391** · `pass → compile_error`: **0** · `fail → pass`: 0 ·
  `compile_error` unchanged (26 = 26, so #3468 adds ZERO new js2wasm CEs).

**The 391 `pass→fail` are NOT the intended floor-lowering.** Sampling them shows
they fail with a **WebAssembly.instantiate CompileError** (invalid Wasm), not an
assertion throw: `call[0] expected type (ref null 6=$AnyString), found externref`
in a harness closure. The routing makes the test262 harness (`sta.js`+`assert.js`)
COMPILE its `assert`/`assert.sameValue` function bodies — and those bodies hit a
**pre-existing standalone codegen bug** that produces invalid Wasm.

**Root cause (minimal, PRE-EXISTING, independent of #3468):** a function
EXPRESSION whose externref param is reassigned to a native-string literal in one
branch and then string-concatenated:
```js
const f = function (msg) { if (msg === undefined) { msg = ''; } else { msg += ' '; } msg += 'x'; return msg; };
```
compiled `--target standalone` produces invalid Wasm (`__str_concat` called with
an externref where `(ref null $AnyString)` is expected) on **BOTH origin/main and
this branch** — no expando, no routing, no C-core involved. `assert.sameValue`'s
message-building (`if (message === undefined) { message = ''; } else { message += ' '; }
message += 'Expected…'`) is exactly this shape. A plain function DECLARATION with
the same body is VALID — the bug is specific to function EXPRESSIONS / closures.

**Implication:** #3468's C-core + routing are correct for their scope, but the
routing cannot be net-positive until this pre-existing string-codegen bug is
fixed — otherwise the harness compiles (correct) → hits the string bug → invalid
Wasm → ~391 assert-using tests flip from vacuous-pass to fail-to-instantiate (a
regression, not the truthful correction). The string bug is a SEPARATE issue
(function-expression externref-param reassign-to-native-string type unification),
a prerequisite for landing #3468's routing. #3468 stays `blocked`; PR held; not
merged.

## PR-shepherd resolution (2026-07-20) — land captured-closure substrate; keep harness rollout blocked

The string-codegen prerequisite above landed on current `main` as #3472, so the
held PR was re-measured from its own latest `merge_group` run
(`29749566966`, merge SHA `ea8d3e523cbbb667cf0df30494bd0caa46fdc2e0`)
against the exact standalone baseline commit
`55e90a8441c27438823144c54d869928d6114b8e`.

The result disproves the remaining premise that the top-level harness routing
can be part of a normal conformance-preserving PR:

- 3,608 stable pass→non-pass regressions with changed Wasm (compile-timeout
  noise excluded), versus 18 improvements;
- 3,540 of those are `wasm exception during module init` after the test body was
  previously reached — the test262 assertions are now executing and exposing
  existing semantic mismatches;
- both baseline and candidate use `oracle_version: 8`; this is not oracle drift;
- the absolute host-free floor also falls to 25,048, 405 below the committed
  25,453 high-water mark.

Those failures cannot be erased honestly inside a closure-property routing
change: doing so requires fixing the exposed language/runtime semantics. A
baseline edit, verdict exception, or swallowed assertion would weaken the
oracle and is explicitly rejected.

Therefore PR #3418 is narrowed to the first principled **captured-closure
substrate** slice:

- route only concrete closure subtypes with captured lexical bindings through
  the dynamic runtime side table; shared noncapturing wrappers remain on their
  current behavior;
- keep seven executed round-trip, invocation, side-effect, identity, isolation,
  metadata, and noncapturing-boundary tests;
- remove the top-level `FunctionDeclaration` statement-retention arm and its
  harness tests from this PR;
- keep this issue `blocked` for a future staged harness rollout after the
  exposed failures are fixed, with no floor rebaseline.
