# #1155 — `[object WebAssembly.Exception]` misclassified as compile_error

## Problem

1,415 test262 results in the current main baseline have `status: "compile_error"` with `error: "[object WebAssembly.Exception]"` and `compile_ms: 1–2` (cache hit). These tests include:

```
test/built-ins/String/prototype/replaceAll/replaceValue-call-skip-no-match.js
test/built-ins/String/prototype/replaceAll/searchValue-replacer-call-abrupt.js
test/built-ins/String/prototype/search/S15.5.4.12_A1_T12.js
test/built-ins/String/prototype/search/S15.5.4.12_A2_T7.js
test/language/module-code/export-expname-binding-index.js
```

Most of these tests are **expected to throw** at runtime — `assert.throws(TypeError, () => ...)` style — and the wasm module correctly raises the expected exception. But instead of being reported as `pass` (because the exception matches the expectation) or `fail` (if it doesn't), they are reported as `compile_error` with the uninformative string `[object WebAssembly.Exception]`.

The misclassification makes these tests show up as regressions vs. sprint-42/begin (2026-04-12) even though the underlying wasm behavior is unchanged.

## Root cause

Two bugs compounded:

### 1. Classification bug in `scripts/test262-worker.mjs`

Around line 380–395, the unified worker wraps `WebAssembly.instantiate(result.binary, importObj)` in a try/catch and classifies **any** thrown error as `status: "compile_error"` with `instantiateError: true`. But a wasm module can validly throw a `WebAssembly.Exception` during instantiate when its start function (e.g. `_start` from PR #177) throws a user-defined tag. That is a runtime behavior, not a compile/validate failure.

The fix: distinguish `WebAssembly.CompileError` / `WebAssembly.LinkError` (which are real compile/instantiate failures) from `WebAssembly.Exception` / `Error` (which are runtime throws from the start function). The latter should fall through to the test execution path; if `isRuntimeNegative`, report `pass`; otherwise continue to try calling `instance.exports.test` (may also need to re-instantiate, since the instance wasn't bound).

### 2. Poor error stringification

`err.message ?? String(err)` falls through to `String(err)` for `WebAssembly.Exception`, which stringifies as `[object WebAssembly.Exception]` — zero useful detail. Must instead:
- Extract the exception tag (e.g. `instance.exports.__exn_tag`) and pull the payload via `.getArg(tag, 0)`.
- If the payload is an `Error` subclass, use `payload.message`.
- Otherwise stringify the payload directly.

The same extraction logic already exists in `scripts/test262-worker.mjs` for the *execution* path (around line 438–450). The fix is to move it into a helper and call it from both the instantiation catch and the execution catch.

### 3. (PR #177 interaction)

Before PR #177, module init ran lazily on first call to `test()` — any throw was caught during test execution and classified properly. PR #177 added a `_start` export for module-init-only programs, but the **guarded path** (which is what test262-wrapped tests use, because they `export function test()`) was preserved. So PR #177 does **not** change init behavior for test262 tests. The 1,415 cluster is therefore a pure classification/stringification bug on the worker side, **not** a compiler regression.

## Fix approach

1. In `scripts/test262-worker.mjs` around L383–395 (the `WebAssembly.instantiate` try/catch):
   - If `err instanceof WebAssembly.CompileError` or `err instanceof WebAssembly.LinkError`: emit `status: "compile_error"` as today.
   - Else (WebAssembly.Exception / generic Error): route through the same extraction logic used in the execution catch; if `isRuntimeNegative`, emit `status: "pass"`; else emit `status: "fail"` with the extracted message.
2. Factor out the exception-payload extractor into a small helper (`extractWasmExceptionMessage(err, instance)`) and call it from both catches.
3. Re-run test262 and verify the 1,415 cluster reclassifies to `pass`/`fail` as appropriate.

## Acceptance criteria

- `grep '\[object WebAssembly.Exception\]' benchmarks/results/test262-results.jsonl | wc -l` → 0 after the fix.
- Tests that throw the expected exception in a runtime-negative assertion report `pass`.
- Tests that throw an unexpected exception report `fail` with a descriptive message (not `[object WebAssembly.Exception]`).
- No new regressions in `tests/equivalence.test.ts`.
