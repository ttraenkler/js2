# Issue #258: Unsupported call expression -- double/triple nested calls

## Status: done

## Summary
~270 tests fail with two "Unsupported call expression" errors, and ~36 with three. These represent nested call patterns like `f(g())`, `a(b(), c())`, or deeply chained calls. The call expression compiler needs to recursively handle call expressions as arguments to other calls.

## Category
Sprint 4 / Group A

## Complexity: M

## Scope
- Handle call expressions used as arguments to other call expressions
- Handle triple-nested and deeper call chains
- Update argument compilation in `src/codegen/expressions.ts`

## Acceptance criteria
- Nested call expressions (call as argument) compile
- At least 40 compile errors resolved

## Implementation Notes

Two changes made to `src/codegen/expressions.ts` in `compileCallExpression`:

1. **Parenthesized callee unwrapping**: Added early handling for `(fn)(args)`, `((fn))(args)`,
   `(obj.method)(args)` etc. Unwraps parenthesized expressions and recurses, except for
   function/arrow expressions (IIFEs) and comma expressions which have dedicated handlers.

2. **CallExpression as callee** (`fn()()`): Added support for calling the result of a function
   call when it returns a closure. Uses the TS type checker to get call signatures of the
   inner call's return type, then matches against registered closure types in
   `closureInfoByTypeIdx` by comparing parameter count/types and return type. Converts the
   externref result back to the closure struct ref using `any.convert_extern` + `ref.cast`,
   then uses `call_ref` pattern to invoke the closure.

Note: Storing a function-returned closure in a variable and calling it later (e.g.,
`const add10 = makeAdder(10); add10(12)`) is a separate pre-existing limitation related
to closure variable coercion, not addressed by this issue.
