# Issue 9: for-in loops

## Status: done

## Summary
Support `for (const key in obj)` iteration over object (struct) field names.

## Motivation
`for...in` is used for dynamic key iteration and general object traversal.

## Design
`for...in` over a Wasm GC struct is not possible at runtime — struct field names don't exist at the Wasm level. Two options:

### Option A: Compile-time unrolling (practical)
The struct fields are known at compile time. Unroll the loop by emitting one iteration per field, with `key` bound to a string literal for each field name.

```ts
for (const key in point) { console.log(key); }
// compiles to:
console.log("x");
console.log("y");
```

Limitation: mutation of fields by name is not possible. Read-only unrolling only.

### Option B: Runtime object map (complex)
Represent iterable objects as `externref` (JS objects), passed from the host. Then `for...in` delegates to the host. This sidesteps Wasm struct iteration entirely.

**Recommended: Option A for structs, Option B for `any`-typed objects.**

## Scope
- `src/codegen/statements.ts`: add `compileForInStatement`. Check if the iterated expression is a known struct; if so, unroll. If `any`/externref, emit host-delegated iteration (complex, may defer).
- Tests: `tests/codegen.test.ts`.

## Acceptance criteria
- `for (const key in {x: 1, y: 2}) { ... }` at minimum compiles without error (even if unrolled).
