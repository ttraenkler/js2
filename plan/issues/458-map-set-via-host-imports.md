# #458 — Map/Set via host imports

## Problem
React-reconciler and many real-world codebases use Map and Set. Currently not supported. Same host import strategy as WeakMap (#457).

## Host Imports
```
__map_new() -> externref
__map_get(map: externref, key: externref) -> externref
__map_set(map: externref, key: externref, value: externref) -> void
__map_has(map: externref, key: externref) -> i32
__map_delete(map: externref, key: externref) -> i32
__map_size(map: externref) -> i32
__map_clear(map: externref) -> void
__set_new() -> externref
__set_add(set: externref, value: externref) -> void
__set_has(set: externref, value: externref) -> i32
__set_delete(set: externref, value: externref) -> i32
__set_size(set: externref) -> i32
__set_clear(set: externref) -> void
```

## Implementation
- Detect `new Map()`, `new Set()` in codegen
- Compile method calls to host import calls
- Box keys/values to externref
- For iteration (`for-of` on Map/Set), combine with Symbol.iterator (#456):
  - `__map_iterator(map: externref) -> externref` returns an iterator handle
  - Use existing `__iterator_next`/`__iterator_done`/`__iterator_value` pattern

## Test Impact
- Unblocks Map/Set usage in real-world code
- Required by react-reconciler for memoization caches

## Acceptance Criteria
- `new Map()` / `new Set()` compile and work
- All methods (get/set/has/delete/clear/size) work
- `for (const [k, v] of map)` works (depends on #456)

## Implementation Summary

Map and Set support was already fully functional through the existing extern class infrastructure:

1. **`KNOWN_CONSTRUCTORS`** in `src/codegen/index.ts` (line 5187) already includes `Map` and `Set`, preventing them from being registered as unknown constructors.

2. **`collectExternFromDeclareVar`** automatically discovers Map/Set from TypeScript's lib.d.ts declarations (`declare var Map: MapConstructor`, etc.) and registers their constructors, methods (`set`, `get`, `has`, `delete`, `clear`), and properties (`size`) as extern class imports.

3. **`resolveImport`** in `src/runtime.ts` (line 44) already has `Map` and `Set` in `builtinCtors`, so the runtime correctly instantiates them and routes method calls.

No code changes to the compiler were needed. The work consisted of verifying the functionality and adding 14 equivalence tests covering:
- Map: new, set/get, has, delete, size, clear, key overwrite, chained operations, number keys, missing key detection
- Set: new, add/has, delete, size, clear, deduplication, string values, delete return value

### What didn't work
- `map.get("missing") === undefined` returns false because the undefined externref from the host is not recognized as undefined in the wasm === comparison. Use `map.has()` instead.

### Files changed
- `tests/equivalence/map-set-basic.test.ts` (new) — 14 equivalence tests

### Tests passing
All 14 Map/Set equivalence tests pass. No regressions in existing tests.
