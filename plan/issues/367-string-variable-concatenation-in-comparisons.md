# #367 -- String variable concatenation in comparisons

## Status: open

14 tests do string variable concatenation that is not being handled correctly in comparison contexts.

## Details

```javascript
var a = "hello";
var b = "world";
assert.sameValue(a + " " + b, "hello world");
```

The issue may be that string concatenation produces a value whose type is not correctly reconciled when used in comparison operations (e.g., `===` or `sameValue`). The concatenated result should be a proper string that compares correctly with string literals.

Investigation needed to determine the exact failure mode -- whether it's a type mismatch (externref vs stringref), incorrect concat implementation, or comparison logic issue.

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] String variable concatenation produces correct results
- [ ] Concatenated strings compare correctly with `===`
- [ ] `assert.sameValue` works with concatenated string results
- [ ] 14 previously skipped tests are now attempted
