# #820a — RegExp Symbol.* / RegExpStringIterator null deref

## Problem
148 official test262 failures across:
- test/built-ins/RegExp/prototype/Symbol.match/* (~48)
- test/built-ins/RegExp/prototype/Symbol.replace/* (~41)
- test/built-ins/RegExp/prototype/Symbol.search/* (~21)
- test/built-ins/RegExp/prototype/Symbol.matchAll/* (~25)
- test/built-ins/RegExpStringIteratorPrototype/next/* (~13)

All "dereferencing a null pointer [in test()]".

## Root cause hypothesis
1. ToLength(R.lastIndex) coercion is skipped — string values like '1.9' reach the host regex engine raw.
2. R.exec user override is bypassed — Symbol.match/replace/search must invoke `Get(R, "exec")` per spec, not call `RegExpBuiltinExec` directly. Monkey-patched `r.exec = function() {...}` is ignored.

## Fix location
src/runtime.ts — @@match / @@replace / @@search / @@matchAll helpers (lines ~945, ~969).
src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts — lowering of `r[Symbol.match](s)`.
Suggest a shared `__regexp_exec_user(r, s)` runtime helper.

## Impact: ~148 fails

## Implementation (issue-820a-regexp-symbol)

Three coordinated changes:

1. **codegen/expressions/calls.ts** — added a dispatch block after the
   `@@iterator` / `@@asyncIterator` routing that handles `@@match`, `@@replace`,
   `@@search`, `@@matchAll` by emitting calls to four new host imports
   (`__regexp_symbol_match`, `…_replace`, `…_search`, `…_matchAll`). Previously
   these method names fell through to the "no method matched" fallback which
   dropped the receiver/args and pushed `ref.null.extern`.

2. **codegen/literals.ts** — added `matchAll: 15` to `WELL_KNOWN_SYMBOLS` so
   `Symbol.matchAll` resolves to the wasm key `@@matchAll` instead of returning
   undefined and falling through to the unresolved-element-access fallback.
   The mirroring runtime maps (`_symbolToWasm`, `_symbolIdToKeys`,
   `__box_symbol` cache) gained the same entry; the `key <= 14` range checks
   in `_safeGet` / `_safeSet` / `__extern_get_idx` were bumped to `<= 15`.

3. **runtime.ts** — registered the four new host imports (~75 LOC). Each does
   `r[Symbol.X](s)` so the JS engine performs the full ECMA-262 21.2.5
   dispatch: `Get(R, "exec")` honoring user overrides and
   `ToLength(R.lastIndex)` coercion. Before the JS call, `_ensureExecCallable`
   inspects `r.exec`: when it's a WasmGC closure struct (assigned via
   `r.exec = function() { … }` in user code), wrap it as a JS function via
   `_wrapWasmClosure`, trying arities 1-4 in order so the wrapper survives
   dead-import elimination of unused `__call_fn_N` trampolines.

## Test Results

`tests/issue-820a.test.ts` — 10/10 passes, covering:
- success path for each @@match / @@replace / @@search / @@matchAll
- `RegExpStringIterator.next()` iteration via `r[Symbol.matchAll]`
- `ToLength('1.9')` lastIndex coercion (sticky flag)
- user `exec` override callCount + throw propagation
- global-flag match returning an array of all matches

Wider regression sweep: `npx vitest run` on issues 1018, 1055, 1062, 1090,
1162, 1229, 1232, 1253, 1269 + `tests/equivalence/regexp-methods.test.ts`
(16 cases) + iterator suites → all 74+16+10 = 100 tests green. The 4 pre-
existing failures in `symbol-basic.test.ts` and 2 in `symbol-async-iterator`
reproduce on `origin/main` HEAD without these changes (unrelated drift).

## Known limitation

Tests that assert `thisValue === r` inside a user-supplied `exec` override
(e.g. `test262/built-ins/RegExp/prototype/Symbol.match/exec-invocation.js`)
still fail because the WasmGC-closure → JS-function bridge does not propagate
the JS `this` into the closure's lexical scope. The closure observes its
captured-or-undefined `this`, not the receiver `R`. Tracked separately as
a closure-`this`-binding gap (not in scope for #820a).
