# Issue #553: Division by zero missing in constant folding

## Problem

The `tryStaticToNumber` constant folding function in `expressions.ts` was missing zero-divisor guards for both `SlashToken` (division) and `PercentToken` (modulo). When the right operand is `0`:

- `x / 0` produces `Infinity` or `-Infinity` (or `NaN` for `0/0`)
- `x % 0` produces `NaN`

While these are valid JS semantics, the sister function `resolveConstantExpression` already guards against zero divisors by returning `undefined` (bailing out of constant folding). The `tryStaticToNumber` function should be consistent and let these cases fall through to runtime Wasm evaluation.

## Fix

Add `right !== 0 ?` guards on both `SlashToken` and `PercentToken` cases in `tryStaticToNumber`, matching the pattern in `resolveConstantExpression`.
