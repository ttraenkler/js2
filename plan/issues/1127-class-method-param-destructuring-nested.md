## Resolution (2026-04-21)

Fixed by prior PRs (rest pattern destructuring), verified against
origin/main 2026-04-21. Probe tests for `[...[x,y,z]]`, `[...{length}]`,
`[...[]]`, `[...[,]]`, `[...[...x]]`, and flat `[...r]` all pass on
current main.

The attempted fix in PR #254 (branch `issue-1127-dstr-init`) for the
`meth-static-ary-ptrn-elem-ary-empty-init` test262 shape was misscoped:
it widened all class-method binding-pattern params with nested
initializers to externref, which broke the typed ref_null destructure
path and caused 691 regressions (394 assertion_fail) in CI. The
`bindingPatternHasInitializer` helper and both callsites in
`src/codegen/class-bodies.ts` were reverted (commit f5a4d122 on
`issue-1127-dstr-init`); PR #254 was closed without merging.

The remaining failure (nested empty array pattern `[[] = init()]` where
the initializer returns an iterator/generator) is a separate
iterator-consumption-semantics bug, tracked in **#1159** — not covered
by the #1127 fix surface.


# #1127 -- Class method param destructuring: nested array pattern + initializer throws spurious TypeError

## Problem

Class methods (including `static` methods) whose parameter destructures a
nested array binding pattern with an `Initializer` on the inner element
throw a spurious `TypeError: Cannot destructure 'null' or 'undefined'`
at runtime, even when the caller supplies a valid argument.

Minimal repro:

```ts
class C {
  static m([[] = [1,2,3]]: any) { return 1; }
}
C.m([[]]);           // expected: 1, actual: throws TypeError
C.m([[1, 2, 3]]);    // expected: 1, actual: throws TypeError
```

A free function with the same binding pattern also fails:

```ts
function m([[]]: any) { return 30; }
m([[1]]);            // throws TypeError
```

## Affected test262

The "BindingElement with array binding pattern and initializer is used"
sub-patterns in `test/language/statements/class/dstr/` and
`test/language/expressions/class/dstr/` account for roughly **48 direct
failures** with the normalized error `TypeError (null/undefined access):
BindingElement with array binding pattern and initializer is used`, plus
spillover into variants without an explicit initializer.

Representative tests:

- `test/language/statements/class/dstr/meth-static-ary-ptrn-elem-ary-empty-init.js`
- `test/language/statements/class/dstr/meth-ary-ptrn-elem-ary-elem-init.js`
- `test/language/expressions/class/dstr/meth-ary-ptrn-elem-ary-empty-init.js`

All three fail with the same TypeError payload.

## Investigation

### Throw sites

`src/codegen/destructuring-params.ts` has six call sites that invoke
`buildDestructureNullThrow(ctx)`:

- L250 `emitExternrefDestructureGuard` — `ref.is_null` check
- L258 `emitExternrefDestructureGuard` — `__extern_is_undefined` check
- L445 object ref_null — null-close guard
- L706 tuple ref_null — null-close guard
- L881 array ref_null — null-close guard (primary)
- L893 array ref_null — null-close guard (secondary)

Each site was instrumented with a unique tag in a scratch probe to
identify which one fires on the failing cases.

### Confirmed firing sites

- Running real test262 `meth-static-ary-ptrn-elem-ary-empty-init.js`:
  the `guard-null` site in `emitExternrefDestructureGuard` fires
  (externref branch, `ref.is_null` check).
- A simpler in-repo class-method repro (static method with
  `[[] = [1,2,3]]` parameter): the `ary-null-close` site at L881 fires
  (ref_null branch inside `destructureParamArray`).

Both failures produce `TypeError: Cannot destructure 'null' or 'undefined'`
— the diagnostic is correct, but the runtime precondition is not.

### Hypothesis

Class method parameter types flow through a different resolution path
than free-function parameters.

- `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts` L946-967: class method params are typed
  via `resolveWasmType(ctx, paramType)` and widened to `ref_null` if the
  param has an initializer or `?` token.
- `src/codegen/function-body.ts` (free-function path): a different path
  produces an externref in cases that match the failing repro.

Entry points for destructuring:

- class methods: `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts` L1067
  `destructureParamArray(ctx, fctx, paramLocalIdx, param.name, params[paramLocalIdx]!.type)`
- the resulting `paramType` is either a typed `ref_null(vec_X)` or an
  `externref`, and that distinction decides whether
  `destructureParamArray` enters its externref conversion branch
  (L464) or the typed ref_null branch (L603+).

When the typed branch is entered for a nested pattern whose inner
pattern has an initializer, the initializer replaces a null inner but
the outer array's own null-close guard still fires because the
intermediate ref_null conversion yields a null value — this matches the
observed `ary-null-close` site.

When the externref branch is entered, `emitExternrefDestructureGuard`
fires `guard-null` on a value that is *not actually null* from the
caller's perspective, suggesting the intermediate pattern walk is
loading a field that ends up null after default-substitution went down
the wrong branch.

### What needs clarifying

1. Why does the externref branch's `ref.is_null` check fire on input
   that the caller passes as a non-null array?
2. Why does the typed-ref_null branch fire its `ary-null-close` guard
   when the nested pattern has an initializer that should have replaced
   any null with the default value?
3. Are class-method param resolution rules (`resolveWasmType` in
   class-bodies.ts) diverging from free-function param resolution in a
   way that steers these patterns through the wrong branch?

## Scope

- root-cause the divergence in destructuring for nested-array-with-
  initializer patterns
- unify the class-method vs free-function paths so they both handle
  this pattern correctly
- ensure initializer substitution happens *before* the outer null-close
  guard checks its intermediate value
- avoid regressing simpler patterns (single-level, rest, object-nested)

## Non-goals

- no changes to the default-value semantics itself
- no changes to the error message text (the message is already spec-
  correct when an actual null/undefined is destructured)

## Acceptance criteria

- `C.m([[]])` and `C.m([[1,2,3]])` return normally for
  `class C { static m([[] = [1,2,3]]: any) { ... } }`
- The 48+ test262 tests in the "BindingElement with array binding
  pattern and initializer is used" bucket flip from FAIL to PASS
- No regressions in other class/dstr or function/dstr test262 buckets
- Equivalence tests still pass

## Pointers

- `src/codegen/destructuring-params.ts`
  - `buildDestructureNullThrow` at L109
  - `emitExternrefDestructureGuard` at L240
  - `destructureParamArray` at L464 with branch split for
    externref vs typed ref_null
  - null-close guards at L881, L893
- `src/codegen/class-bodies.ts`
  - L946-967: param typing via `resolveWasmType`
  - L1067: entry to `destructureParamArray` for class methods
- `src/codegen/function-body.ts` L265+: comparable free-function path

## Repro artifacts

Probe scripts left in the worktree `.tmp/`:
- `.tmp/repro-trace2.ts`
- `.tmp/run-trace2.mts`
- `.tmp/inspect-test262.mts`
- `.tmp/inspect-exc.mts`

These run the failing patterns against both class methods and free
functions and print which tagged throw site fires.
