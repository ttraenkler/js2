# #511 -- Wasm validation: call/call_ref type mismatch (~514 CE)

## Status: in-progress

~514 tests fail with Wasm validation errors where function call arguments have the wrong type. This supersedes the previous estimate of 65 CE.

### Error breakdown

| Pattern | Count |
|---------|-------|
| `call[N] expected type (ref N), found ref.null of type (ref null none)` | 403 |
| `call_ref[N] expected type externref, found array.get/local.get` | 111 |

### Root cause

1. **ref.null type mismatch (403 CE)**: When passing `null` as an argument to a function expecting a non-nullable struct ref, the compiler emits `ref.null` which has type `(ref null none)` but the callee expects `(ref N)`. The compiler needs to handle nullable argument passing -- either by making the callee's parameter nullable or by guarding against null at the call site.

2. **call_ref externref mismatch (111 CE)**: When calling a function reference (closure/callback), the compiler passes a value with the wrong Wasm type. Typically an `array.get` result (which returns the array element type) or a `local.get` of the wrong type where `externref` is expected.

### Coordinates with
- #445 (call args missing) -- different pattern but same area
- #446 (call_ref type mismatch) -- overlaps with the call_ref subset
- #401 (Wasm validation umbrella)

### Files to modify
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- `compileCallExpression`, argument emission
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- `coerceType` for null-to-ref coercion

## Complexity: M

## Implementation Notes

### Fix 1: ref_null -> ref coercion (403 CE)
- In `coerceType()`, added `ref.as_non_null` instruction when coercing from `ref_null` to `ref` (same or different typeIdx)
- Previously the function silently returned without emitting any coercion for this case
- Also fixed `pushDefaultValue()` for `ref` kind: emit `ref.null` + `ref.as_non_null` (traps at runtime if consumed, but satisfies the type checker)
- Also fixed `defaultValueInstrs()` for `ref` kind: same pattern

### Fix 2: call_ref element type coercion (101 CE)
- Added `coercionInstrs()` helper function that returns Instr[] for type coercion (for use in pre-built instruction arrays)
- Updated all array callback inline implementations to insert coercion between `array.get` (produces elemType, e.g. f64) and the closure's expected parameter type (e.g. externref)
- Affected methods: filter, map, reduce, forEach, find, findIndex, some, every
- Also updated Array.prototype.call variants: every, some, forEach

### Fix 3: receiver type hints at call sites (7 sites)
- Added `expectedType` parameter (from `getFuncParamTypes`) when compiling receiver expressions at 7 call sites in `compileCallExpression` and related dispatch paths
- Sites fixed: setter dispatch, struct field set, logical assignment accessor, compound assignment accessor, inc/dec accessor, class method dispatch, struct method dispatch
- This enables automatic coercion via `compileExpression`'s existing `coerceType` infrastructure
- Prevents Wasm validation errors where receiver type (e.g. externref) doesn't match callee's first parameter type (e.g. ref null N)
- Remaining ~128 call[] mismatches come from: class expression globals typed as externref, property-access.ts paths (locked by another dev), and spread argument patterns
