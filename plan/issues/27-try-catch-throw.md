# Issue 27: Try/catch/throw

## Status: done

## Summary
Support `try { ... } catch (e) { ... } finally { ... }` and `throw` statements.

## Motivation
Error handling is fundamental. Without it, any runtime error crashes the Wasm module with no way to recover.

## Design

### Option A: Wasm exception handling proposal
The Wasm exception handling proposal adds `try`, `catch`, `throw`, and `rethrow` instructions. This is the cleanest mapping but requires engine support (available in Chrome 95+, Firefox 100+, Node 17+).

### Option B: Return-based error propagation
Encode errors as tagged union returns (success/error). Every function that may throw returns a struct with a tag field. Callers check the tag and propagate. This works on all engines but changes the ABI.

### Recommendation
Option A is preferred since ts2wasm already requires GC proposal support, which implies a modern engine.

## Scope
- `src/ir/types.ts` — add `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `rethrow` instructions
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — `compileTryStatement`, `compileThrowStatement`
- `src/emit/binary.ts` — emit exception handling opcodes
- `src/emit/opcodes.ts` — add exception handling opcodes
- `src/emit/wat.ts` — format try/catch blocks
- Tests: new `tests/exceptions.test.ts`

## Complexity: L

## Acceptance criteria
- `try { throw 42; } catch (e) { return e; }` returns 42
- `finally` block runs in all cases
- Uncaught throw traps the module
