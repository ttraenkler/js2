# #720 — Wasm validation: i32.add expects i32, got f64 (96 CE)

## Status: open

## Problem

96 tests fail with "i32.add[0] expected type i32, found global.get of type f64". The compiler emits `i32.add` on values that are f64 globals.

## Root cause

Some global variables are declared as f64 but used in integer arithmetic contexts (like loop counters or bitwise ops). The compiler emits `i32.add` without first converting f64 → i32 via `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s`.

## Approach

1. Find where `i32.add`/`i32.sub` etc. are emitted on non-i32 operands
2. Insert `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` coercion before i32 operations when operand is f64
3. Check if this is related to the native type annotation system (`type i32 = number`)

## Complexity: S
