# #1198 — Pre-size dense arrays at allocation site

## Problem

In array-fill loops of the canonical shape:

```js
const values = [];
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  values[i] = expr;
}
```

js2wasm currently allocates a zero-capacity array and grows it on every `values[i] = ...`. Each grow is O(current length) — copy old buffer → new buffer with one extra slot. For 1M iterations, that's **~500 billion** scalar copies of array contents in the worst case, even if the runtime amortises with doubling-on-grow (still hundreds of millions of scalar copies).

V8 detects this pattern and pre-allocates `values` with capacity `n` upfront (or close to it after a few iterations). We can do the same at AOT time with a much simpler analysis — pure AST pattern match — because we don't need runtime profile feedback.

## Implementation plan

In codegen, before lowering an array-literal initializer `[]`, look at the next few statements for the canonical fill pattern:

```ts
ts.VariableStatement {
  declaration: const a = [];   // or: let a = []
}
ts.ForStatement {
  initializer: let i = 0
  condition: i < n     // n: ts.Identifier or ts.LiteralExpression
  incrementor: i++ or i += 1
  body: contains exactly one expression statement of shape a[i] = ...
        AND no other writes to a or to i except the loop variable
        AND no reads of a.length (which would observe the grow-as-you-go behaviour)
}
```

When matched, emit the array allocation as `new Array(n)` (pre-sized to n) instead of `[]` (zero capacity). The Wasm-side primitive is `array.new_default <typeIdx> <size>`, which allocates a fixed-size WasmGC array zero-initialised.

If `n` is a constant, even better — emit a fixed-size allocation. Otherwise emit `array.new_default <typeIdx>` with `n` from the loop bound expression.

Code touch points:

- `src/codegen/expressions/array-literal.ts` (or wherever `[]` is lowered) — add the post-allocation hook to consult the look-ahead analysis
- `src/codegen/analysis/dense-fill.ts` (new file) — pattern matcher, pure function over AST
- Tests: `tests/issue-1192.test.ts`

## Acceptance criteria

1. `array-sum` competitive benchmark `runtimeArg=1000000` hot runtime improves by **at least 2×** standalone (no other Tier 1 fixes applied). Combined with #1195/#1196/#1197 the total improvement is multiplicative.
2. The fill pattern with `n` as a parameter is correctly pre-sized:
   ```js
   function f(n) {
     const a = [];
     for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] = i * 2;
     return a;
   }
   f(1000); // must work, must return [0, 2, 4, ..., 1998]
   ```
3. Patterns that DON'T match must fall back to grow-on-write:
   - `for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) { a[i] = ...; if (...) a.push(x); }` — pushes inside body
   - `for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) ...` — reads `a.length` inside the loop
   - `let i = 0; while (...) a[i++] = ...` — non-canonical loop shape (file separately if needed)
4. New equivalence test in `tests/issue-1192.test.ts` covering the matching and non-matching cases above.
5. CI test262 net delta ≥ 0; arrays sub-suite strictly improves.

## Out of scope

- Sparse arrays (`a[100] = x` with no fill before): that's still grow-on-write and the analysis must NOT pre-size in this case.
- Two-loop fusion (handled by #1195 escape analysis when the array doesn't escape).
- Mixed-type arrays (handled by #1197).

## Risk

Low. The pattern is conservative — only triggers when the inner-loop body is a single `a[i] = ...` statement with no other side effects. The transformation preserves semantics: pre-sizing just allocates contiguous slots that `a[i] = ...` would have grown into anyway, with the same ECMAScript-observable result (`a.length === n` after the loop).

One subtlety: if the loop body throws partway through, ECMAScript expects `a` to have the partial length corresponding to how far the loop got. Pre-sizing to `n` would make `a.length === n` even after a throw. **Test this case explicitly.** If we can't preserve it, restrict the pattern to bodies that provably don't throw.

## Notes

This is the simplest of the three Tier 1 array-perf wins (~1 day estimate per the bench analysis). Composes with:

- #1195 (escape analysis) — eliminates the array entirely when non-escaping; this issue is a fallback for arrays that DO escape
- #1196 (bounds-check elimination) — pre-sized arrays make BCE easier (length is now a known constant)
- #1197 (i32 element specialization) — orthogonal storage optimization

The 2026-07-30 IR follow-up recognizes canonical counted `push` loops. The
matcher and element lowering live in `src/ir/array-element-lowering.ts`; these
allowances cover only the necessary backend-neutral node, builder, verifier,
and exhaustive-lowering plumbing in the central IR drivers.
