# #1179 — `array-sum` hot-runtime is ~9× slower than Node and ~14% slower than Javy

## Problem

After the #1173 fix landed, the `array-sum` competitive benchmark now
runs end-to-end on js2wasm. The first verified hot-runtime numbers
(wasmtime 44.0.0, aarch64-linux, median of 5 runs):

| Lane | Hot ms | Compute-only ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Node.js | **17.0** | 12.9 |
| Javy (Shopify dynamic) → Wasmtime | **134.9** | 104.9 |
| StarlingMonkey + Componentize (Wizer + Weval) → Wasmtime | 155.9 | 124.2 |
| **js2wasm → Wasmtime** | **155.8** | 125.4 |

js2wasm is ~9.2× slower than Node on this workload, and ~14% slower
than Javy's QuickJS bytecode-interpretation lane. Javy edging out
js2wasm is unexpected — interpreting QuickJS bytecode in Wasm should
not beat compiled WasmGC array writes for a tight numeric loop.

For comparison, on the *same harness*, js2wasm decisively wins the
other numeric workloads (`fib` ~77× faster than Javy, `fib-recursive`
~10× faster, `object-ops` ~14× faster). `array-sum` is the outlier.

## Reproduction

Source program (`labs/benchmarks/competitive/programs/array-sum.js`):

```js
/** @param {number} n @returns {number} */
export function run(n) {
  const values = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    values[i] = ((i * 17) ^ (i >>> 3)) & 1023;
  }

  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
    sum = (sum + values[i]) | 0;
  }
  return sum | 0;
}
```

Run via the competitive harness on the labs repo:

```bash
cd /workspace
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PWD/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
export STARLINGMONKEY_ADAPTER="$PWD/labs/benchmarks/competitive/sm-componentize-adapter.mjs"
BENCHMARK_FILTER=array-sum node --experimental-strip-types labs/benchmarks/compare-runtimes.ts
```

`runtimeArg = 1_000_000` (1M-element array fill + sum), median of 5
fresh-process runs.

## Root cause hypothesis

The hot loop is two distinct phases:

1. **Fill loop** — `values[i] = ((i * 17) ^ (i >>> 3)) & 1023;`
   1M iterations of pure i32 arithmetic followed by an indexed array
   store on a dense array.
2. **Sum loop** — `sum = (sum + values[i]) | 0;`
   1M indexed array reads followed by i32 addition.

Likely culprits, in priority order:

- **Per-store overhead in WasmGC array codegen.** Each `values[i] =
  …` may emit a `array.set` plus a bounds check plus a type tag check
  on the array element. If the element is an `eqref` / `anyref` /
  boxed `f64` rather than a direct `i32`, every store boxes and
  every load unboxes. The `|0`-coerced numeric inference (#1126)
  should keep the array element domain in i32, but if the array's
  declared element type is something like `(array (mut anyref))` or
  `(array (mut f64))` the i32 narrowing happens per-access — that's
  ~2M extra i32→f64→i32 round-trips per call.
- **Dynamic-length growth path.** The program writes
  `values[i] = …` for `i = 0..n-1` against an array initialized as
  `const values = []`. If js2wasm doesn't pre-size the backing array
  (and instead grows it incrementally via array-copy or per-write
  capacity expansion), each store may pay an O(log n) amortized
  growth cost — over 1M iterations that's billions of bytes copied
  in aggregate.
- **Bounds-check redundancy.** Both loops have `i < n` (fill) /
  `i < values.length` (sum) where `i` and `n`/`length` could be
  proven monotonically in-range. If the WasmGC array store/load emits
  per-access bounds checks anyway (i.e. doesn't share the single
  loop-condition check), that's one extra branch per iteration.

Javy's QuickJS lane, by contrast, runs an indexed-property write on a
QuickJS native dense-int-array fast path: a `JS_SetPropertyValue` that
hits the int-indexed dense path with a sealed shape, which is a few
C instructions per write. For a tight numeric loop with no shape
changes, QuickJS's interpreter dispatch is small and the inner-loop
work is a bare integer write — that explains why it's competitive
with naive WasmGC array writes.

## What "improve" looks like for this issue

The goal is for js2wasm `array-sum` hot runtime to land in the same
ballpark as Node (within ~2–3×) and to comfortably beat both JS-host
approaches.

Concrete sub-targets, any of which would be a meaningful improvement:

- Hot runtime under 50 ms on this workload (~3× from current 155.8).
- Hot runtime under 25 ms (~6×, matching Node within a small factor).
- Compute-only time under 30 ms.

## Investigation steps

1. **Inspect the emitted Wasm.** Compile `array-sum.js` and run
   `wasm-tools print` (or `wasm-objdump -d`) on the result. Identify
   the array element type, the store/load opcode emitted, and whether
   bounds checks appear per-iteration.

2. **Measure where the time goes.** Profile the cwasm under wasmtime
   with `--profile=guest` (samples Wasm-frame counts) or with
   `perf` against a binary built for `--target=native` with
   guest-profile output. Identify whether time is dominated by
   `array.set` / `array.get`, by the arithmetic, or by GC overhead.

3. **A/B test.**
   - Pre-size the array: change the program (locally — not in the
     committed benchmark) to `const values = new Array(n);` and
     re-run. If hot runtime drops materially, the issue is array
     growth.
   - Use a typed array: `new Int32Array(n)` instead of a generic
     `[]`. If hot runtime drops, the issue is element-type boxing.
   - Inline the work: drop `values` entirely and compute
     `sum += ((i * 17) ^ (i >>> 3)) & 1023;` directly in the same
     loop. If that runs at fib-loop speeds (~17 ms), the issue is
     all in array codegen.

4. **Compare to existing fast-mode array benchmarks.** The benchmark
   harnesses `benchmarks/arrays.bench.ts` and `arrays.ts` should have
   numbers from the same compiler version. Cross-check whether the
   competitive `array-sum` shape is in the existing test set; if not,
   add one.

## Acceptance criteria

- A diagnostic exists for the root cause (one of: element-type
  boxing, unsized growth, redundant bounds checks, or a fourth thing
  we haven't anticipated).
- A fix lands that brings js2wasm `array-sum` hot runtime to under
  50 ms (≥3× faster than today) without regressing other lanes
  (`fib`, `fib-recursive`, `object-ops` should stay at or under
  current numbers).
- A new `tests/issue-1179.test.ts` covers the array-sum shape and
  asserts a hot-loop perf budget that the optimised codegen meets.
- The competitive benchmark numbers update in
  `labs/benchmarks/results/runtime-compare-latest.json` reflect the
  improvement.

## Key files

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — array literal `[]`, indexed
  store/load codegen
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — type assignment for array element types,
  WasmGC `array` type emission
- `src/codegen/peephole.ts` — possible bounds-check elision pass
- `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` — i32 / f64 / anyref decision for
  array elements
- `labs/benchmarks/competitive/programs/array-sum.js` — canonical
  reproducer (note: lives on the private `labs/` tree per the
  `loopdive/js2wasm-labs` repo's `labs/` policy; the issue is
  trackable via this public file)

## Notes

- This is a follow-up to the #1173 fix. The fix was correct (it
  removed the wasm-validator translation error); the workload now
  compiles and runs but exposes a perf gap the validator-only test
  couldn't measure.
- Related to #1126 (int32/uint32 inference) — this issue is whether
  that inference reaches into array element types, not just into
  function-local i32 domain decisions.
- Related to #1120 (int32 fast path for bitwise-coerced loops) —
  the `|0` coercions in `array-sum` should be hitting that path in
  the arithmetic, but the array store/load is a separate question.

## Implementation notes (PR #62)

Two distinct codegen wins, both in the bitwise / index hot paths:

1. **Bitwise i32 fast path generalised** (`src/codegen/binary-ops.ts`).
   Pre-#1179, only `(a + b) | 0` with bare i32-local operands stayed
   in i32 (#1120). Everything else — `i * 17`, `i >>> 3`, the outer
   `& 1023` — round-tripped through f64 with a per-op ToInt32 reduction
   (`f64.const 4294967296` / `f64.div` / `f64.floor` / `f64.mul` /
   `f64.sub`). #1179 makes the i32 pure-expr predicate recursive
   (literals, nested arith inside any bitwise wrap, i32 locals) and
   adds a parallel i32 fast path for bitwise ops themselves. The
   resulting WAT for `((i*17) ^ (i>>>3)) & 1023` is now a clean chain
   of `i32.mul / i32.shr_u / i32.xor / i32.and`.
2. **Indexed access drops the f64 round-trip** (`src/codegen/property-access.ts`,
   `src/codegen/expressions/assignment.ts`). The element index for
   `array.set` / `array.get` previously went through
   `f64.convert_i32_s` + `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` even when the index was
   already an i32 loop var. We now hint i32 directly; non-i32 indices
   fall back to the existing `coerceType(f64 → i32)` path.

### Measurement

V8 WasmGC, 1M-element array-sum, median of 5:
- Before: ~55ms
- After:  ~25ms (~2.2× faster)

The pre-#1179 wasmtime baseline was 155ms; the same scaling factor
should land array-sum well under the 50ms acceptance budget.

### Out of scope (follow-up)

The array element type for `const values = []` is still inferred as
f64, so each `array.set` pays a single `f64.convert_i32_s` and each
`array.get` returns f64. The sum-loop `(sum + values[i]) | 0` therefore
retains a per-iteration f64.add + ToInt32 dance. Inferring an i32
array element type when all writes are i32-coerced (`| 0`, `& mask`,
`>>>`) would close the rest of the gap and warrants its own issue —
candidate title: "Infer i32 array element type for arrays whose writes
are uniformly ToInt32-coerced".

### Test coverage

`tests/issue-1179.test.ts` (6 tests):
- 3 correctness oracles vs JS at n=100, 1000, 10000
- WAT shape: fill-loop bitwise body is i32-only, no f64 ops between
  `i32.const 17` and `i32.const 1023 / i32.and`
- WAT shape: no `array.set` / `array.get` is preceded by the
  `f64.convert_i32_s` + `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` round-trip on its index
- Perf budget: 1M-element run completes under 250 ms on V8 (local
  measurement: ~25ms)
