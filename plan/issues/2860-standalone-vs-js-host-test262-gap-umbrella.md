# Umbrella: close the standalone-vs-js-host test262 gap

> **THE SPRINT FOCUS (stakeholder directive, 2026-06-30).** Closing the
> standalone-vs-js-host gap is the top priority for the current budget window.
> Every child issue here is `priority: high` + `sprint: current` and sorts to
> the TOP of the auto-synced TaskList. Non-standalone `sprint: current` work
> (acorn remnants #2850/#2853, IR-migration #2855–#2859, and the other ES/spec
> umbrellas #2669/#2803/#1042) is demoted to `priority: low` — kept claimable
> as tail-filler but sorting under the standalone work.

## The gap (honest metric, #2879 via #2360)

The metric was made **honest** in #2879/#2360: a standalone pass is only
credited when it is **host-free** (no leaked host imports), not when a leaky
binary is host-satisfied. On the honest metric:

- **js-host** passes **~34,052** official tests.
- **host-free standalone** passes **~12,883**.
- The honest **standalone gap is ~20,500 tests** — roughly double the earlier
  ~9,177 figure, which counted host-satisfied leaky passes as standalone wins.

The gap decomposes into two halves:

1. **The carriers (~architecture-scale half).** Whole language features that
   leak host imports because there is no Wasm-native carrier yet:
   generators **#2864** (697), async-generators **#2865** (986), Promise/
   microtask **#2867** (375), Symbol **#2866** (418). These are the biggest
   single lever and warrant an architect frame-substrate design pass.
2. **The substrate + de-masked real-failure clusters (the other half).** The
   dynamic-object substrate, the proto-glue / CE clusters (**#2861** remaining,
   **#2863**), and the de-masked real-failure clusters that surfaced once the
   metric stopped masking them behind #2862: TypedArray **#2872** (294),
   language/expressions **#2873** (276), String **#2875** (159), RegExp
   **#2876** (125), tooling/triage **#2877**, plus the invalid-Wasm residual
   **#2878**.

Measured 2026-06-30 from the two lane baselines in `loopdive/js2wasm-baselines`
(`test262-current.jsonl` vs `test262-standalone-current.jsonl`, official-scope,
matched by file+strict). The standalone baseline tags each row with
`host_import_leak_class` and the leaked `imports` set, which drives the
clustering below. (The legacy per-cluster counts in the table below are from
the pre-honest measure and are kept as the relative root-cause breakdown; the
absolute total is now ~20,500 per the honest metric.)

## Clusters (by root cause → est. tests → issue)

Counts are **overlapping** for the cross-cutting substrate signatures (a test
can leak a host import AND fail at ToPrimitive); the "pure" column is the count
where that cluster is the sole blocker (no host-import leak), i.e. the count a
single fix flips directly.

| # | Cluster | total | pure | tractability | issue |
| - | ------- | ----- | ---- | ------------ | ----- |
| 1 | built-in static/proto value read refused (CE) | 882 | 882 | mechanical (glue pattern) | **2861 — done** |
| 2 | ToPrimitive over built-in exotics + inherited valueOf/toString | 2,039 | 728 | medium (extend `__to_primitive`) | **2862 — wont-fix (superseded)** |
| 3 | dynamic-shape object/property codegen (`__get_builtin`, `__extern_toLocaleString`) CE | 365 | 365 | medium codegen | **2863 — done** |
| 4 | sync generators — no standalone carrier (`__gen_*`/`__create_generator`) | 697 | — | hard (new carrier) | **2864 — in-progress** |
| 5 | async generators — no standalone carrier (`__create_async_generator`) | 986 | — | hard (dep #2864) | **2865 — in-progress** |
| 6 | Symbol — standalone carrier (`__box_symbol`) | 418 | — | medium-hard | **2866 — in-progress** |
| 7 | Promise / async microtask — standalone carrier (`Promise_*`, `__make_callback`) | 375 | — | hard | **2867 — in-progress** |
| 8 | invalid Wasm binary emitted in standalone (correctness) | 523 | 118 | triage-then-fix | **2868 — done** |

### Not-yet-issued follow-ons (tracked here)

**Groomed 2026-07-16 (PO pass): every bullet below now has an owning issue —
none of this section is actually un-issued anymore.** $Object reader → #3027
(done); TypedArray internals → #3177 (ready); gOPD 124 → MOP lineage #2884/
#2885/#2896/#2965 (done), #2984/#2992 (in-progress), #2874/#3250 (done);
eval/Function → #3005 (done) / #3017 (ready); spread/`Array.from(iter,n)`
~321 → #2904/#2995/#3206/#3100 (all done); namespace static reads ~120 →
#2933 (ready); illegal-cast → folded into #2863/#2868 (both done); null-deref
`__str_flatten`/RegExp ~185 → #2935 (ready). This umbrella is fully groomed —
no new child issues needed; #3178 (the generator/async/Promise host-machinery
deep-dive within cluster rows 4/5/7 above) is the one active sub-umbrella
still carving new slices (see #3178 itself, and #3302 spun from it).

- **$Object dynamic-object-property reader** — **[#3027](3027-standalone-dynamic-object-property-reader-residual.md)
  is `done` (2026-07-05)**, superseding this note. Re-measurement found the
  originally-hypothesized root cause
  (`project_standalone_any_string_value_read_substrate`, the dynamic `any`
  reader dropping native-string VALUES) was already fixed by #2861/#2863 — it
  is NOT why the residual read 1,552. That residual is a **heterogeneous
  long tail**, not one root cause: TypedArray(Constructors) internals/
  prototype (~350), `Temporal` (~230+, a whole deferred feature area, not a
  codegen bug), `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` (124, itself 3 unrelated
  shapes — built-in/global descriptors, `ToPropertyKey` coercion, array-
  element descriptors), the already-tracked eval/Function-shim gaps
  (#3005/#3017), and many smaller one-off gaps. #3027 fixed the one
  genuinely-addressable codegen bug found during the trace (computed/
  bracket string property+method access never dispatching to the native
  string engine in `--nativeStrings` mode — ~5-9 tests) and recommends the
  PO/tech-lead triage the remaining clusters into separately-sized follow-on
  issues (TypedArray internals, ~350, is the next-largest single slice).
- **spread / `Array.from(iter, n)`** (`__array_from_iter_n`) — ~321 tests.
  Depends on the iterator-protocol carrier (#2864).
- **Namespace static reads** (`Math.PI`, `JSON.stringify`, `Reflect.get`,
  `Atomics.add`) — ~120 tests. Split out of #2861 (different mechanism: not
  `.prototype` proto-glue). Updated 2026-07-02 (#2861 closed; #2863 remeasure):
  namespace static **data constants** (`Math.PI`/`E`/`LN2`,
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`) now fold, and static-method **calls**
  (`Math.max(…)`, `JSON.stringify(…)`) compile. The live residual is
  static-method **value reads** (`const f = JSON.stringify; f(x)`,
  `Math.max` as a value — the #1907/#1888 S6-b refusal) plus reflective
  correctness bugs (`Math[computedKey]` → 0, `globalThis.Math.PI` traps).
- **illegal cast** — 1,177 total but only ~102 pure; the rest are inside the
  generator/iterator machinery and clear when #2864/#2865 land. The ~102 pure
  ref.test-before-cast misses fold into #2863/#2868 triage.
- **null deref in `__str_flatten`/RegExp** — ~185, mostly `String.prototype.split`
  with a RegExp arg + RegExp character-class escapes; standalone-native string/regex
  bug. File separately if it doesn't clear with #2863.

## Sequencing (carriers are the biggest lever)

**Carrier track (architecture-scale — the dominant lever, ~2,476 combined).**
The carriers share a common need: a Wasm-native suspendable-**frame substrate**
(the arch-frame design). Build that once, then layer the carriers on it:

1. **Frame substrate** — the suspendable activation-frame ABI shared by
   generators, async-generators and the Promise/microtask scheduler. Architect
   frame-substrate spec lives in **#2860 / #2864** (`architect_spec: candidate`).
2. **#2864** sync generator carrier (697) — first carrier on the frame; proves
   the substrate end-to-end.
3. **#2867** Promise / microtask carrier (375) — the microtask scheduler the
   async machinery needs; independent enough to land in parallel once the frame
   exists.
4. **#2865** async-generator / for-await carrier (986) — composes the generator
   frame (#2864) with the microtask scheduler (#2867); `depends_on: [2864, 2867]`.

**#2866** Symbol carrier (418) is independent of the frame substrate and can run
in parallel on its own track.

**Substrate + cluster track (runs in parallel with carriers).**

5. **#2861** built-in static/proto value-read glue (mechanical, ~882 remaining) —
   dev-standalone, start now.
6. **#2863** dynamic-shape `__get_builtin` / reflective read codegen.
7. **#2878** invalid-Wasm residual (`__str_flatten` + user-body shapes) — broken
   binaries are worst-class correctness; follows the #2868 URI-carrier fix.
8. De-masked real-failure clusters (surfaced once the honest metric stopped
   masking them behind #2862): **#2872** TypedArray (294), **#2873**
   language/expressions (276), **#2875** String (159), **#2876** RegExp (125).
9. **#2877** standalone exception message readability — tooling/triage enabler
   (lower lever; unblocks message-level triage of the residual).

**Done / blocked children (no longer queued):**

- **#2868** invalid-Wasm emission (URI/str_flatten carrier) — **done** (via #2350).
- **#2874** getOwnPropertyDescriptor numeric-key coercion — **done** (via #2354).
- **#2879** honest host-free metric — **done** (via #2360); this is what
  re-based the gap to ~20,500.
- **#2862** ToPrimitive over built-in exotics — **blocked** (superseded; the
  de-masked clusters #2872/#2873/#2875/#2876 carry the tractable residual).

## 2026-07-12 groom — fresh method-family slices (PO, lane-baseline remeasure)

Remeasured from the two lane baselines (fetched 2026-07-12): the honest gap
(host `pass` ∧ standalone NOT host-free pass, official scope, file+strict
match) is **12,801** rows. After mapping every existing sub-front, nine
genuinely-uncovered method-family clusters were sliced (all `sprint: current`,
`priority: high`, `umbrella: 2860`):

| issue | cluster | measured gap | horizon |
| ----- | ------- | -----------: | ------- |
| **3169** | Array.prototype callback HOFs over array-like receivers | 519 | l |
| **3170** | Array.prototype indexOf/lastIndexOf/includes as-value + array-likes | 125 | m |
| **3171** | Map/Set/WeakMap/WeakSet receiver brand-check protocol | ~142 (+ share of 113 residual) | m |
| **3172** | Set-algebra set-like protocol + getOrInsert(Computed) | 120 | m |
| **3173** | DataView.prototype get\*/set\* spec semantics | 230 | l |
| **3174** | Date brand checks + ToPrimitive coercion order | 107 | m |
| **3175** | Number.prototype toString(radix)/toFixed/valueOf | 74 | m |
| **3176** | JSON.parse/stringify residual (reviver array walk, strictness) | 67 | m |
| **3177** | TypedArrayConstructors internals + ctor protocols (the #3027 "~350" slice) | 356 | l |

Deliberately NOT sliced (covered or in-flight): `Object/defineProperty(-ies)`
+ `Object/create` (492 — routes through the in-progress #2992 defineProperties
MOP + #2984 lane), `Object` statics order/spread (#3155 ready),
`Function.prototype.bind` residual (63 — fnctor lane #3138/#3139),
`Array/fromAsync` (#2967 blocked on #3134), Atomics (#3145),
`Iterator.*` (#3146/#3049), DisposableStack (needs the #2866 Symbol carrier),
`language/*` (carriers #2864/#2865/#2867 + #2873), annexB residual (~180,
follow-on candidate after #3069's pattern).

## Definition of done (umbrella)

Standalone official_pass climbs from 24,656 toward the 33,032 host figure.
Each child issue's test plan = its cluster's standalone-CE/fail tests flip to
pass under full `merge_group` + the standalone high-water floor
(`check-standalone-highwater.mjs`), with zero host-mode regression (all changes
`ctx.standalone`-gated).

## Implementation Plan (Fable, 2026-07-18) — fresh census @ main 9d216ada + the priority ladder

> Measured from the 2026-07-18 baselines-repo refresh (commit `5c6d3092`,
> compiler @ `9d216ada`): host official pass **32,178**, standalone official
> pass **24,726** (24,723 headline ± scope rows). Honest gap (host `pass` ∧
> standalone not-pass, official scope, file+strict match): **8,231** — down
> from 12,801 (07-12 groom) and ~20,500 (06-30). The window closed ~4,570
> rows. The decomposition below is the current scoreboard; census script
> shape: parse both jsonl lanes, key `file|strict`, group the gap rows by
> `status:error_category`, leak-import name, and 2/3-level test dir.

### The gap, by mechanism (2026-07-18)

| Rows | Mechanism | Owner(s) |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 2,991 | `compile_error: host_import_leak` | the carrier track (below) |
| 4,079 | `fail: assertion_fail` | behavioral clusters (below) |
| 677 | `fail: type_error` | behavioral clusters |
| 112 / 66 | `illegal_cast` / `null_deref` | mostly inside carrier machinery + #2935 |
| 261 | `compile_error: other/wasm/runtime` | #2878-class triage residual |
| 45 | timeout/syntax/oob/misc | long tail |

**Leak half (2,991), by leaked import:** generator family
(`__create_generator` 1,672 + `__gen_next` 106 + `__create_async_generator`
72 + async-gen proto 16) ≈ **1,866** → #2864/#2865 via the #3178 retirement
umbrella. Promise family (`_reject` 367 + `_new` 158 + `_all` 81 +
`_allSettled` 23 + `_catch` 16 + `_any` 14 + misc) ≈ **~680** → #2867/#3178.
`__dynamic_import` **107** → NO owner (decision below). Small tails:
`__array_from_async` 25 (#2967/#3134), `__instanceof_check` 24 (#2916
Slice B — spec'd 2026-07-18), `Set_constructor` 17, misc ≤17 each.

**Behavioral half, by cluster (assertion_fail + type_error combined):**

| Rows | Cluster | Owner |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| ~960 | TypedArray (`TypedArray/prototype` 532+63, `TypedArrayConstructors` 68+38+30, DataView 33+, ArrayBuffer 40) | #3177 / #3173 / #2872 |
| ~550 | property model (`Object/defineProperty` 247 + `defineProperties` 142+27 + `create` 55+14 + `Object/prototype` 62) | #3251 S2/S3 (PR #3327 in flight) + #739 + #2992/#2984 |
| ~512 | `Array/prototype` behavioral (418+94) | #3169 / #3170 + #3251 read-side |
| ~350 | String (`String/prototype` 282+20 + annexB/String 46) | #2875 |
| ~223 | `Iterator/prototype` (182+41) | #3146 / #3049 |
| ~212 | class semantics (`language/*/class` 106+106) | #2873 + the #2963/#3037 method-identity residue |
| ~169 | `RegExp/prototype` | #2876 / #2935 |
| ~136 | annexB eval-code type_errors (123) + direct eval (13) | eval Tier-0 sound-bail residue (#1102-adjacent; see the ladder doc §2 bail list) |
| ~76 | `Function/prototype` (61+15) | #3138 / #3139 bind residual |
| ~109 | `assert.sameValue(rest.a, undefined)`-signature family (44+31+33 shapes) | the value-rep trio — #2106 numeric-carrier leg + #745 (see their 2026-07-18 plans) |

### Priority ladder (order of expected yield per unit work)

1. **#3178 carrier retirement (generators + Promise)** — 2,546 leak rows,
   ~31% of the whole gap, single-theme. Stays rank 1; #3178 is actively
   carving slices (#3302 etc.) — feed it, don't fork it.
2. **TypedArray family** (#3177 → #3173 → #2872) — ~960 rows; #3177's 356
   estimate from 07-12 has GROWN in share as other clusters closed.
3. **Property model** — ~550 rows riding the in-flight #3251 (S2 write-side
   + S3 ArraySetLength are the spec'd next slices) + #739.
4. **Array behavioral** (#3169/#3170) — ~512; partially overlaps 3 (many
   defineProperty-on-array rows count in both — de-dup at claim time).
5. **String** (#2875) ~350, **Iterator** (#3146/#3049) ~223, **class**
   (#2873) ~212, **RegExp** (#2876/#2935) ~169 — parallel dev-lane tracks.
6. **Value-rep signature family** (~109) — falls out of the #2106/#745
   plans; do not staff separately.
7. **annexB eval-code** (~136) — bounded; only after the ladder-doc bail
   list is re-reviewed (routing rule 2: broadening Tier-0 needs a semantics
   proof).

### Decisions needed (PO/lead — the only actions this census adds)

- **`__dynamic_import` (107 rows) has no owning child.** Options:
  (a) route to #1046 (separate ES-module compilation — dynamic import is a
  module-loading feature, and a standalone story needs module linking
  #2527); (b) declare deferred-feature (join eval/Proxy/with in the skip
  rationale) and re-tag the rows out of the honest gap. Recommendation:
  **(a) as a documented later phase of #1046**, keep counting the rows —
  they are honest misses, not wont-fixes.
- The 07-12 groom's nine method-family slices (#3169–#3177) remain the
  right cut — no new child issues are warranted by this census; counts
  above re-weight their priority only (notably #3177 up, #3171/#3172 down —
  Set/Map rows shrank to ~95 combined).

### Census reproducibility

Fetch both lanes from `loopdive/js2wasm-baselines` (fetch helper or raw at
a pinned commit), filter `scope_official`, key `file|strict`, and group as
above. Re-run at each window boundary; the ladder re-orders on measured
counts, never on stale estimates (this census corrected three of the 07-12
weights).
