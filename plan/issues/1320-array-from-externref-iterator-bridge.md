# #1320 — Array.from / Iterator.from runtime bridge drops own [Symbol.iterator]

> **2026-05-29 — array-receiver case folded into the array object-value
> representation track.** The case where `Array.from` is given a **compiled
> array** whose `Array.prototype[@@iterator]` was overridden cannot be fixed at
> the runtime-bridge layer: `_materializeIterable` (`src/runtime.ts:1185`) walks
> `__vec_len`/`__vec_get` and bypasses `@@iterator` because the compiled array is

## Background

Filed as a follow-up to #1154 after closing it as resolved. The original
~378 leak-cluster is fixed; 4 tests still hit the
`%Array%.from requires that the property of the first argument,
items[Symbol.iterator], when exists, be a function` error, but the root
cause is **different** — they fail standalone (verified in isolation),
not from prior-test prototype poisoning.

## Failing tests

- `test/built-ins/Array/from/iter-cstm-ctor.js`
- `test/built-ins/Array/from/iter-set-length.js`
- `test/built-ins/Iterator/from/iterable-primitives.js`
- `test/built-ins/Iterator/prototype/flatMap/iterable-primitives-are-not-flattened.js`

The first two fail with the exact V8 native error. The latter two fail
with `WebAssembly.Exception` (likely the same root cause routed through
a different code path).

## Repro

```bash
npx tsx -e "
import { compile } from './src/index.ts';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { buildImports } from './src/runtime.ts';
const src = readFileSync('test262/test/built-ins/Array/from/iter-cstm-ctor.js', 'utf-8');
const r = compile(src, { fileName: 'test.ts', skipSemanticDiagnostics: true });
const imports = buildImports(r.imports, undefined, r.stringPool);
await WebAssembly.instantiate(r.binary, imports);
"
```

Throws synchronously from `WebAssembly.instantiate`:

```
%Array%.from requires that the property of the first argument,
items[Symbol.iterator], when exists, be a function
```

The error originates from V8's native `Array.from` inside our runtime's
host-import bridge for the compiled `Array.from(items)` call.

## Hypothesis

The test source pattern is:

```js
var items = {};
items[Symbol.iterator] = function() {
  return { next: function() { return { done: true }; } };
};
result = Array.from.call(C, items);
```

When this compiles, `items` becomes an externref (a JS object reference)
in wasm memory, and the assignment `items[Symbol.iterator] = ...` routes
through our runtime's safeSet for symbol-keyed properties.

Suspected: the safeSet path for `Symbol.iterator` on a plain JS-host
object (externref-wrapped `{}`) either:

1. Routes the assignment to a sibling property (well-known-symbol ID
   path) instead of installing an own `[Symbol.iterator]` descriptor on
   the target object, OR
2. Installs the descriptor on a wrapper that V8's `Array.from` doesn't
   see when walking `items[Symbol.iterator]`.

When the compiled `Array.from(items)` then calls into the host import,
the host invokes native `Array.from(items)`. V8 reads
`items[Symbol.iterator]`, finds either nothing or a non-function value
(inherited from `Object.prototype` after the safeSet path mis-routed),
and throws.

## Investigation start points

- `src/runtime.ts` — locate the `__safeSet` / `_safeSet` host import for
  symbol-keyed property assignment. Compare its handling of
  `Symbol.iterator` on a plain JS object vs. on a wasm-managed struct
  (`_isWasmStruct(obj)` gate referenced in the worker comment at
  test262-worker.mjs L546–554, which describes a similar miss-route
  pattern that #1160 had to defensively clean up).
- `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` (or wherever `Array.from` /
  `Iterator.from` is lowered) — verify the call site emits the
  externref directly without re-wrapping.

## Acceptance criteria

1. The 4 listed tests no longer throw the `%Array%.from requires...`
   error in `WebAssembly.instantiate`.
2. `iter-cstm-ctor.js` instantiates and the test body's
   `assert.sameValue(callCount, 1, ...)` passes.
3. No new regressions in tests under
   `test/built-ins/Array/from/` or `test/built-ins/Iterator/`.

## Out of scope

- Prototype-poisoning leak handling (covered by #1154 — closed).
- Any non-`Array.from` / non-`Iterator.from` symbol-iterator bugs.

## Investigation + partial fix 2026-05-27 (dev-1605)

**Root cause (confirmed, refines the hypothesis above):** the assignment
`items[Symbol.iterator] = fn` is NOT mis-routed — the key arrives at `_safeSet`
as a real `symbol` and the function is stored under the correct
`[Symbol.iterator]` slot. The real problem is that `fn` is a **compiled Wasm
closure struct** — `typeof items[Symbol.iterator] === "object"`, not
`"function"`. Native `Array.from` / `Iterator.from` read the @@iterator method,
see a non-callable object, and throw
`%Array%.from requires that … items[Symbol.iterator] … be a function`. The
iterator object the closure returns (and its `.next`) are likewise Wasm
closures, so even invoking @@iterator isn't enough — the whole protocol must be
driven through `__call_fn_0`.

**Fixed in this PR (the `__array_from` host-import path):** added a module-level
`_drainWasmClosureIterable(obj, callbackState)` in `src/runtime.ts` that, when a
plain JS object's own @@iterator is a Wasm closure, invokes it via `__call_fn_0`,
then walks the returned iterator's (also-closure) `.next`, reading
`value`/`done` via `_safeGet` + `__sget_*`. Wired into the `__array_from`
import. Result: `built-ins/Array/from/iter-set-length.js` now **PASSES** (was
FAIL). Covered by `tests/issue-1320.test.ts` (2 cases: no spurious TypeError;
@@iterator invoked exactly once).

**Residual — the other 3 listed tests need other bridge paths (NOT fixed here):**

1. `iter-cstm-ctor.js` uses `Array.from.call(C, items)` → routes through
   `__extern_method_call` (obj=`Array.from`, method=`"call"`), hits native
   `Array.from` directly. Needs the same drain applied to the `.call`/`.apply`
   dispatch where the iterable is `wrappedArgs[1]`.
2. `Iterator/from/iterable-primitives.js` + `flatMap/...` use
   `Number.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function*(){…}` (a **generator** on a
   prototype) and `Array.from(5)` (primitive → ToObject). Different facets:
   prototype-level @@iterator + primitive coercion + `function*` lowering.

**Separate lurking codegen bug (carved to #1684):** an iterator-result object
literal returned from a *nested closure* does not round-trip across the
Wasm→host boundary. The 4 listed tests use empty/trivial iterators so they
dodge this. This overlaps the iterator bridge family (#1620 / #1633) and the
live-mirror struct-field readback (#983d).

## `.call` / `Iterator.from` blocker confirmed (2026-05-27, dev-1605)

The `.call`-path drain is correctly wired (`__extern_method_call`,
`wrappedArgs[1]`), and `_drainWasmClosureIterable` is reached for
`Array.from.call(C, items)`. Traced through the real `runTest262File`
harness with `iter-cstm-ctor.js`:

- `items` arrives as a **plain JS object** (`var items = {}`, not a wasm
  struct), passed through unwrapped — correct.
- its own `[Symbol.iterator]` IS a wasm closure struct — drain guard passes.
- `__call_fn_0` is present; the drain invokes `callFn0(iterFn)` to run the
  `@@iterator()` closure.
- **`callFn0(iterFn)` returns `null`** instead of the iterator object
  `{ next: … }`. The closure's object-literal return value does not
  materialize to the host. The drain then bails at the `iteratorObj == null`
  guard and returns `null`, so the native `Array.from.call(C, items)` runs
  with the un-drained object and throws the "items[Symbol.iterator] … must be
  a function" error.

So the residual `.call` / `Iterator.from` failures are **NOT a host-bridge
gap** — the bridge is wired and reached. They are blocked on the
**closure object-literal return readback** carved to **#1684** (a codegen-layer
bug, not a runtime-bridge one). `iter-set-length.js` PASSES because its
iterator round-trips via the already-working `__array_from` path with a
structure that does materialize.

**Recommendation:** land the `__array_from` + `.call`/`.apply` drain wiring
(regression-free, banks 1 test + focused unit tests). The remaining 3 tests
(`iter-cstm-ctor`, `Iterator/from/iterable-primitives`,
`flatMap/iterable-primitives-are-not-flattened`) are gated on **#1684**
(closure-return struct readback) — they cannot go green at the host-bridge
layer. Status `in-review` for the partial PR; residual tracked in #1684 +
the iterator-bridge family (#1620/#1633).

## Implementation update (2026-06-06, codex-developer)

The earlier #1684 gate was narrower than the actual failure. The four listed
test262 files now pass under the scoped runner after fixing the bridge and two
codegen paths exposed by the bridge:

- closure-backed own `@@iterator` methods can arrive either as raw Wasm closure
  structs or as JS wrapper functions; `_drainWasmClosureIterable` now drives
  both forms, preserves the receiver, reads closure-backed iterator results,
  and drains before `Array.from.call(C, items)` reaches native validation.
- closure wrappers now support dynamic arity, method-call receiver forwarding,
  and best-effort constructor identity; `instanceof` falls back to a dynamic
  host bridge for local closure constructors such as test262's custom `C`.
- `Symbol.iterator`-assigned closures keep their explicit return type instead
  of being contextual-voided, and no-capture closure wrapper structs share a
  common root so mixed `() => void` / `() => object` signatures remain callable
  after an externref round-trip.
- `Iterator.from` is routed through the runtime helper so string primitives keep
  the spec `iterate-string-primitives` behavior, non-string primitives reject,
  helper flattening rejects primitives, and string iterator accessors have a
  fallback to the intrinsic string iterator after compiled accessor bridging.
- The scoped test262 harness `compareArray` shim accepts `any[]`, matching
  test262 cases that compare arrays of strings.

Scoped validation:

```bash
npm test -- tests/issue-1320.test.ts
npx tsx <four-file runTest262File loop>
npm run typecheck
```

Results: `tests/issue-1320.test.ts` passes all 6 focused tests; the four listed
test262 files pass; typecheck passes.

## Merge refresh (2026-06-10, codex-developer)

Merged current `origin/main` into `symphony/1320` for PR #1253. The only
implementation conflict was in `src/runtime.ts`, where the #1320
`Iterator.from` bridge had to be kept unconditional while current main's
Iterator.zip / zipKeyed / concat closing helpers were retained. The resolved
helper keeps the explicit spec modes: `Iterator.from` uses
`iterate-string-primitives`; helper flattening paths use `reject-primitives`.

Scoped validation after the merge:

```bash
npm test -- tests/issue-1320.test.ts
npx tsx <four-file runTest262File loop>
npm run typecheck
```

Results: focused issue tests pass (6/6), the four listed test262 files pass,
and typecheck passes. PR remains ready for review as #1253.

## Architect Spec — standalone (no-JS-host) GetIterator / IteratorStep / IteratorClose bridge (2026-06-04)

**Scope note.** The investigation above is the **JS-host** `Array.from` /
`Iterator.from` bridge (in-review, gated on #1684). This section is the
**orthogonal standalone (`--target wasi` / `nativeStrings`) iteration protocol**
the host imports cannot cover — the lead's "generic GetIterator/IteratorStep/
IteratorClose bridge for standalone." It is a distinct, dev-claimable deliverable
(sprint 59) and does NOT depend on #1684 (that's a JS-host closure-return readback
bug). Track it as sub-issue **#1320-standalone**.

### Root cause (standalone gap)

The iteration protocol is delivered by four **JS host imports** registered in
`addIteratorImports` (`src/codegen/index.ts:8035-8067`):

- `__iterator(externref) → externref` — `obj[Symbol.iterator]()`
- `__iterator_next(externref) → (i32 done, externref value)` — multi-value
  (#1620: a freshly-built `$IteratorResult` struct cannot survive the JS hop, so
  the two primitives cross the ABI instead)
- `__iterator_return(externref) → void` — IteratorClose
- `__iterator_rest(externref) → externref` — drain remainder for `[...rest]`

Under standalone/WASI there is no JS host, so any for-of / spread / array-dstr
over a **non-Array iterable** (a generator, a class with `[Symbol.iterator]`, a
Map/Set, a custom iterator) has no protocol. Today the compiler **errors out**:
`array-methods.ts:3090-3098` (`compileArrayIteratorMethod`) reports
`Codegen error: #681 standalone/WASI ... still requires JS-host iterator
helpers`. Direct-array for-of works (index loop, no imports —
`collectIteratorImports`/`index.ts:7993`), and native generators have their own
state-machine drive (`generators-native.ts`), but the **generic object-iterable
protocol** is host-only.

This is the same dual-mode-completeness gap as #1665 (native generators, DONE)
and #1472 (native open-object runtime, DONE) — both already established the
WasmGC-native runtime patterns this bridge builds on.

### Design: a native iteration protocol over compiled iterators

The protocol consumer side already exists generically (for-of loop, spread,
array-dstr all call `__iterator` / `__iterator_next` / `__iterator_return`).
The fix is to make those four operations resolve to **Wasm-native helpers**
when `ctx.standalone || ctx.wasi`, exactly mirroring the dual-mode funcMap
pattern used by `__box_bigint` (#1644), native strings (#679), native RegExp
(#682). The native helpers operate on the compiler's own iterator
representations — they do NOT need a host because a standalone iterable is
always one of a known set of compiled shapes:

1. **A compiled class instance with a `[Symbol.iterator]` method** — the method
   is a Wasm closure/method returning an iterator object (another compiled
   struct with a `.next` method). Drive via `call_ref` (the mechanism
   `_drainWasmClosureIterable` uses on the host side, but emitted as Wasm).
2. **A native generator** — already has `__gen_resume_<g>` returning
   `__NativeGeneratorResult_f64 {value:f64, done:i32}`
   (`generators-native.ts:148-167`). The bridge's `IteratorStep` reads that
   struct directly.
3. **A native Map/Set iterator** (#1103) / **$ObjVec enumeration** (#1472
   Blocker B) — already have entry-walking helpers; the bridge wraps them.
4. **A `$Vec` array** — direct index loop (already host-free).

### The native iterator-record representation

Define one GC struct that unifies the four shapes behind a `next`-style
interface, mirroring `__NativeGeneratorResult` but for the *iterator object*:

```
(type $IterRec (struct
  (field $kind i32)          ;; 0=closure-iter, 1=native-gen, 2=map/set, 3=vec
  (field $obj  (ref null any));; the underlying iterator object / gen state / vec
  (field $idx  (mut i32))))   ;; cursor for vec/map shapes
(type $IterResult (struct (field $value externref) (field $done i32)))
```

- `$IterResult` is the **internal** step result — value as externref (boxed via
  `coerceType`), done as i32. It NEVER crosses a host boundary (standalone), so
  the #1620 struct-survival problem does not apply here.

### Changes

**File: src/codegen/index.ts — `addIteratorImports` (`:8035`)**
- Split into `addIteratorImports` (JS-host, unchanged) and a new
  `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime(ctx)` that registers the four operations as
  **Wasm functions** (`registerNative`, the pattern in `object-runtime.ts`):
  `__iterator`, `__iterator_next`, `__iterator_return`, `__iterator_rest`.
  Gate the choice at the single `collectIteratorImports` call site and at any
  `addIteratorImports` caller: `if (ctx.standalone || ctx.wasi)
  ensureNativeIteratorRuntime(ctx); else addIteratorImports(ctx);`. Because the
  consumer code looks the operations up by the SAME funcMap names, no consumer
  changes are needed — they transparently bind to native fns in standalone.

**File: new src/codegen/iterator-native.ts (or fold into generators-native.ts)**
- `getOrRegisterIterRecType(ctx)` / `getOrRegisterIterResultType(ctx)` — lazy GC
  type registration (mirror `ensureNativeGeneratorResultType`,
  `generators-native.ts:148`).
- `__iterator(obj) → externref` native body — **GetIterator (§7.4.1)**:
  - `ref.test` obj against native-generator state struct → wrap kind=1.
  - `ref.test` against the class-instance struct types that have a
    `[Symbol.iterator]` method → call that method via `call_ref`, wrap the
    returned iterator object as kind=0.
  - `ref.test` against Map/Set iterator / `$ObjVec` → kind=2.
  - `ref.test` against `$Vec` → kind=3, idx=0.
  - else → `__throw_type_error` ("not iterable", §7.4.1 step 5).
  - Return the `$IterRec` (as externref via `extern.convert_any`).
- `__iterator_next(iterRec) → (i32 done, externref value)` native body —
  **IteratorStep + IteratorValue (§7.4.5/§7.4.6)**: switch on `$kind`:
  - kind=1: `__gen_resume_<g>` → read `{value,done}`; box value f64→externref.
  - kind=0: `call_ref` the iterator object's `.next` closure → read the result
    object's `value`/`done` via the open-object getter (the #1472 native
    `__extern_get_idx`/field read, NOT the host `_safeGet`).
  - kind=2: advance the Map/Set/$ObjVec cursor, read entry.
  - kind=3: `idx < $Vec.len` ? element + idx++ : done=1.
  - Keep the multi-value `(i32, externref)` shape so the consumer code is
    byte-identical to the host path.
- `__iterator_return(iterRec) → void` — **IteratorClose (§7.4.8)**: for kind=0,
  if the iterator object has a `.return` method (open-object getter lookup),
  `call_ref` it; else no-op. kinds 1/2/3 have no user `return` → no-op.
- `__iterator_rest(iterRec) → externref` — drain remaining into a fresh `$Vec`
  by looping `__iterator_next` until done; reuse the `$ObjVec`→`$Vec`
  materialization from #1472 Blocker B Slice 2.

**File: src/codegen/array-methods.ts — `compileArrayIteratorMethod` (`:3090`)**
- Replace the `reportError` standalone bailout with the native path: register
  `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime(ctx)` and emit the native `entries`/`keys`/
  `values` iterator-record over the `$Vec` (kind=3 with an index-pair shape for
  `entries`). This is the concrete consumer that the error currently blocks.

### Wasm IR pattern (IteratorStep for kind=0 closure-iterator)

```wasm
;; __iterator_next(iterRec) — kind=0 arm
local.get $rec
struct.get $IterRec $obj          ;; iterator object (ref any)
ref.cast (ref $SomeIterStruct)
;; load + call its .next closure (open-object getter or known method idx)
... call_ref $next_funcTypeIdx ... ;; → result object (ref)
local.tee $resObj
;; done = resObj.done   (open-object i32/bool field read, #1472 native getter)
... → i32 done
local.get $resObj
;; value = resObj.value (→ externref, boxed)
... → externref value
;; multi-value return (done, value)
```

### Edge cases

- **Non-iterable** → TypeError at GetIterator (§7.4.1 step 5), via the native
  `__throw_type_error` path (#1473, already standalone).
- **IteratorClose on early exit** (for-of `break` / throw): the consumer already
  calls `__iterator_return`; the native body must run the user `.return` for
  kind=0 and swallow nothing (§7.4.8 — a throw from `.return` during a normal
  close propagates; during an abrupt close the original completion wins). Flag
  this completion-precedence subtlety for the dev — it's the one place the
  native body must match §7.4.8 exactly.
- **`.next` returns a non-object** → TypeError (§7.4.5 step 3) — `ref.test` the
  result against the open-object/struct types; if it fails, throw.
- **Generators interop**: kind=1 reuses the existing native-gen drive — do NOT
  duplicate the state machine; just adapt its `{value,done}` struct to the
  `(i32,externref)` multi-value shape.

### Slice breakdown

- **Slice 1 — native runtime skeleton + `$Vec`/native-gen kinds (3 & 1).**
  `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime`, `$IterRec`/`$IterResult` types, GetIterator +
  IteratorStep for the two host-free shapes already present (Vec index loop,
  native generator). Unblocks standalone for-of/spread over arrays + generators
  and removes the `array-methods.ts:3094` error for `entries`/`keys`/`values`.
  ~180 LOC.
- **Slice 2 — closure-iterator kind (0).** Class instances / objects with a
  `[Symbol.iterator]` method driven via `call_ref` + open-object result
  readback. The standalone analog of `_drainWasmClosureIterable`. ~150 LOC.
- **Slice 3 — Map/Set/$ObjVec kind (2) + IteratorClose + rest.**
  `__iterator_return` user-`.return` dispatch, `__iterator_rest` drain. ~120 LOC.
- Slice 1 is load-bearing and independently shippable (clears the hard
  standalone error + the array-iterator-method family). 2/3 widen coverage to
  custom iterables and close.

### Test files to verify (compile with `nativeStrings:true` / `--target wasi`)

- `tests/issue-1320-standalone.test.ts`: standalone for-of over (a) array,
  (b) generator, (c) class with `[Symbol.iterator]`, (d) Map; spread `[...gen]`;
  array-dstr `const [a,b] = iterable`; early `break` runs `.return`.
- test262 under `--target wasi`: `language/statements/for-of/*`,
  `built-ins/Array/from/*`, `built-ins/Iterator/*` — confirm the standalone
  error no longer fires and direct-iterable cases pass.

### Risk / conflicts

- No new host imports — all four operations become emitted Wasm fns in
  standalone, satisfying the dual-mode rule. JS-host mode is untouched (it keeps
  the existing imports). ✓
- File overlap: `index.ts` (`addIteratorImports` split), `array-methods.ts`
  (the `:3090` error site), new `iterator-native.ts`, and the native runtime
  in `object-runtime.ts` / `generators-native.ts` it reuses. Coordinate with any
  in-flight #1665/#1472 follow-ups in the merge queue.
- Depends on (already-DONE): #1665 (native generator `{value,done}` struct),
  #1472 Blocker B (native `$Vec` build/iterate, `__extern_get_idx` native arm),
  #1473 (native throw). All merged — Slice 1 is unblocked now.
- Does NOT depend on #1684 (that gates the JS-host `iter-cstm-ctor` case, a
  different layer).

## Spec correction (2026-06-05, dev-iter) — kind=1 native-gen assumption is wrong

The spec's kind=1 design ("reuses the existing native-gen drive — do NOT
duplicate the state machine; just adapt its `{value,done}` struct") is **NOT
implementable as a single generic `__iterator_next`**: native generators use
**per-generator** state structs (`__GenState_<name>`) and resume fns
(`__gen_resume_<name>`) with **no shared supertype**, so a generic
`__iterator_next` holding the state as `any` cannot statically pick the right
resume fn. Driving kind=1 generically requires a `generators-native.ts`
substrate change — a shared `$GenStateBase` supertype + a `resume` funcref field
on each state struct (set at generator instantiation, dispatched via `call_ref`).
That is **Slice 1b** (tech-lead-sequenced; ping lead first + architect-ratify the
`$GenStateBase` shape — it touches the generator substrate contract shared with
#1665 / sd-1472c).

**Slice 1 ships kind=3 ($Vec) + TypeError-default ONLY** (confirmed w/ tech lead
2026-06-05): removes the `array-methods.ts:3094` hard error + native path for
generic for-of/spread over `$Vec` iterables. kind=1 only matters for a generator
escaping into a generic-iterable position; the direct path
(`tryCompileNativeGeneratorForOf`) already covers normal generator for-of.

## Second spec constraint found (2026-06-05, dev-iter) — element boxing in a generic native fn

Two compounding facts make a single generic native `__iterator_next` over a raw
`$Vec` awkward:
1. **No `fctx` in native bodies.** `registerNative` bodies are a standalone
   `Instr[]`; `coerceType(ctx, fctx, …)` can't be called (it pushes into
   `fctx.body`). Element→externref boxing must be emitted inline as raw Instrs.
2. **Per-elemKind `$Vec` variants.** `ctx.vecTypeMap` has a distinct `$Vec`
   struct per element kind (f64, i32, externref, ref-T) with different `data`
   array element types. A generic `__iterator_next(rec)` holding the vec as
   `(ref null any)` would have to `ref.test` against EACH vec variant and box
   per-kind (f64→`__box_number`, i32→`f64.convert_i32_s`+`__box_number`,
   externref→identity, ref→`extern.convert_any`) — a large switch that grows
   with every elemKind.

**Cleaner approach for Slice 1 (recommend confirming w/ tech lead / architect):**
normalize at GetIterator time into a **single canonical externref `$Vec`**
(`getOrRegisterVecType(ctx,"externref")`): the *caller-side* `__iterator`
emission knows the static element type, so box-on-build there (one elemKind in
the IterRec). Then `__iterator_next` only ever reads an externref `$Vec` →
trivial, no per-kind switch, no boxing in the native body. This mirrors how
`__iterator_rest`/array_from already materialize an externref vec. Tradeoff: an
eager copy at GetIterator (O(n) up front) vs. lazy per-step — acceptable for
Slice 1; revisit for perf later. **The `compileArrayIteratorMethod:3090`
consumer already has an `fctx`** (it's called during expression codegen), so the
`.keys/.values/.entries` site can box-on-build into the canonical externref vec
directly without any of this — that path is straightforward and is the primary
Slice-1 win.

Net: Slice 1 = (a) `array-methods.ts:3090` emits a canonical externref-`$Vec`
IterRec (has fctx, easy) + (b) `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime` whose `__iterator`
accepts an already-externref-`$Vec` (or canonicalizes) and `__iterator_next`
reads it. Defer the full multi-elemKind generic GetIterator to a later slice if
the for-of generic path needs raw typed vecs. Confirm shape before coding the
runtime fn.

## Third constraint found (2026-06-05, dev-iter) — TWO standalone refusal sites + producer/consumer contract

Smoke-testing revealed a **second** standalone refusal that blocks the for-of
case, distinct from `array-methods.ts:3090`:

- **Site A** `array-methods.ts:3090` (`compileArrayIteratorMethod`) — the
  `arr.values()`/`.keys()`/`.entries()` *call*. Now swapped to
  `compileNativeArrayIterator` (DONE, typechecks).
- **Site B** `src/codegen/statements/loops.ts:3484` (`compileForOfIterator`) —
  the for-of *consumer* bails with `#681 ... for-of over this iterable still
  requires the JS-host iterator protocol` BEFORE calling `addIteratorImports` /
  `__iterator`. So `for (const v of it)` (where `it = arr.values()`) never
  reaches the native `__iterator`. **This guard must also be gated**: in
  standalone, `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime(ctx)` + proceed through the normal
  `__iterator`/`__iterator_next` consumer path (lines 3497+).

**Producer/consumer contract decision needed (the load-bearing design choice):**
`compileForOfIterator` calls `__iterator(subject)` then drives `__iterator_next`.
But `compileNativeArrayIterator` (Site A) currently returns the **IterRec** (it
calls `__iterator` itself). If the for-of consumer ALSO calls `__iterator` on
that result, it double-wraps (cast IterRec→canonical-vec fails). Fix: make the
contract uniform —
  - **Option 1 (recommended):** `compileNativeArrayIterator` returns the
    **canonical externref `$Vec`** (NOT pre-wrapped), and `__iterator` (called by
    the consumer) wraps it into the IterRec. Then `arr.values()` as a value is a
    canonical vec, and any for-of/spread consumer uniformly does
    `__iterator(vec)` → IterRec → `__iterator_next`. Simplest, single wrap point.
    Requires: drop the `__iterator` call from `compileNativeArrayIterator` (just
    leave the canonical vec as externref on the stack), and gate Site B to call
    `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime` + fall through to the existing `__iterator`
    consumer path. `__iterator`'s `ref.cast` to canonical-vec then succeeds.
  - **Option 2:** `__iterator` is idempotent (ref.test for IterRec → pass
    through; else treat as canonical vec). More robust but more code.

**Remaining Slice-1 work (post-compaction resume):**
1. loops.ts:3484 — replace the standalone `reportError` bail with
   `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime(ctx)` + fall through to the `__iterator` consumer
   path (lines 3497+). Import `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime` into loops.ts.
2. array-methods.ts `compileNativeArrayIterator` — per Option 1, return the
   canonical vec as externref WITHOUT calling `__iterator` (delete the final
   `__iterator` call; the consumer wraps). Keep `.keys()` index-boxing /
   `.values()` element-boxing.
3. Verify: `__iterator`'s `any.convert_extern` + `ref.cast $vecExtern` accepts
   the canonical vec the producer builds (same type), and the null-guard in the
   consumer (loops.ts:3505) doesn't trip on the non-null vec.
4. Smoke-test (repro at $CLAUDE_JOB_DIR/tmp/repro1320.mjs) — both expr-pos
   `.values()`/`.keys()` for-of AND a plain `for (const v of someIterableVar)`
   over a canonical vec, standalone + wasi, no `__iterator*` host imports.
5. Add tests/issue-1320-standalone.test.ts; open PR.

## Suspended Work — Slice 1 (dev-iter, 2026-06-05)

**Worktree:** `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-1320-standalone-iter`
**Branch:** `issue-1320-standalone-iter` (from origin/main @ a7196e888)
**Status:** kind=3 Slice 1 — code WRITTEN + typechecks (iterator-native.ts +
index.ts gate + array-methods.ts swap). NOT YET FUNCTIONAL: Site B (loops.ts:3484)
still bails before reaching the native runtime, and the producer/consumer
contract (Option 1 above) must be aligned. See "Remaining Slice-1 work".

### Confirmed code locations (current origin/main)
- **Consumer ABI** (`src/codegen/statements/loops.ts:3548-3573`,
  `compileForOfIterator`): looks up `__iterator` by funcMap name → `call` →
  result is the iterator as `externref` stored in a local; then `__iterator_next`
  → multi-value `(i32 done, externref value)`; `__iterator_return` for close.
  My native fns MUST keep these exact signatures so the consumer binds
  transparently (wrap `$IterRec` as externref via `extern.convert_any`, unwrap on
  entry via `any.convert_extern` + `ref.cast`).
- **Host imports** to mirror: `addIteratorImports` (`src/codegen/index.ts:8071`):
  `__iterator (externref)->externref`, `__iterator_next (externref)->(i32,externref)`,
  `__iterator_return (externref)->()`, `__iterator_rest (externref)->externref`.
  Gate site: `collectIteratorImports` (`index.ts:8022`, calls `addIteratorImports`
  at `:8066`). Add `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime(ctx)` and branch
  `if (ctx.standalone || ctx.wasi) ensureNativeIteratorRuntime(ctx); else addIteratorImports(ctx);`.
- **registerNative pattern** (`src/codegen/object-runtime.ts:202-215`):
  `funcIdx = ctx.numImportFuncs + ctx.mod.functions.length`; set funcMap;
  `ctx.mod.functions.push({name, typeIdx, locals, body, exported:false})`.
- **$Vec type** (`src/codegen/registry/types.ts:92` `getOrRegisterVecType`):
  struct `{length:i32 mut, data:(ref $arr) mut}`, one variant per elemKind in
  `ctx.vecTypeMap`. `getArrTypeIdxFromVec` (`:182`) extracts the array type.
- **Native-gen** (`src/codegen/generators-native.ts`):
  result type `__NativeGeneratorResult_f64 {value:f64, done:i32}`
  (`ensureNativeGeneratorResultType:148`); **per-generator** state struct
  `__GenState_<name>` (`:193`) and resume fn `__gen_resume_<name>` (`:316`).
  `ctx.nativeGenerators: Map<string,NativeGeneratorInfo>` holds
  `{stateTypeIdx, resultTypeIdx, ...}`.
- **Error site to remove** (`src/codegen/array-methods.ts:3090-3099`,
  `compileArrayIteratorMethod`): standalone `reportError("#681 ...")`. Replace
  with native path: receiver compiles to a `$Vec`; emit a kind=3 IterRec (entries
  needs index-pair shape).
- **Native throw**: `ctx.funcMap.get("__throw_type_error")` (already standalone),
  or `emitThrowTypeError` (`src/codegen/expressions/helpers.ts:104`).

### Design subtlety found (NOT fully covered by the spec)
Native generators use **per-generator** state structs (`__GenState_<name>`) and
resume fns (`__gen_resume_<name>`) — there is no shared supertype. So a single
generic `__iterator_next` cannot `call $gen_resume` generically. Options:
1. Give all `__GenState_*` a shared supertype (`$GenStateBase` with the `state:i32`
   field) + a stored funcref to the resume fn in the IterRec `$obj`/a new field,
   driven by `call_ref`. Cleanest but touches generators-native.ts registration.
2. Slice-1-pragmatic: kind=1 carries a **funcref to the resume fn** captured at
   GetIterator time (when the static generator identity IS known at the for-of
   subject). But generic `__iterator(obj)` doesn't know which generator — it only
   has the state struct as `any`. So option 1 (shared supertype + resume funcref
   field on the state struct, set at generator instantiation) is the real fix.
3. **Recommended Slice-1 scope reduction:** ship kind=3 ($Vec) + TypeError-default
   ONLY — this alone removes the `array-methods.ts:3094` hard error (the
   highest-frequency standalone gap, `.keys()/.values()/.entries()` over arrays)
   and gives generic for-of/spread over a `$Vec`-typed iterable a native path.
   Defer kind=1 (native-gen) to a Slice 1b once the shared-supertype +
   resume-funcref-field plumbing is added to generators-native.ts (coordinate
   with the #1665 owner). Native generators ALREADY have their own dedicated
   for-of drive (`tryCompileNativeGeneratorForOf`) that bypasses `__iterator`
   entirely, so the kind=1 arm only matters for generators that escape into a
   generic-iterable position (spread of a stored generator var, etc.) — lower
   frequency. Confirm scope with tech lead before implementing kind=1.

### Slice 1 plan (kind=3 + TypeError default)
1. New `src/codegen/iterator-native.ts`:
   - `getOrRegisterIterRecType(ctx)` → struct `{kind:i32, obj:(ref null any), idx:(mut i32)}`.
   - `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime(ctx)` (guard on funcMap.has("__iterator")):
     registerNative the 4 ops.
     - `__iterator(externref)->externref`: `any.convert_extern` the arg; `ref.test`
       against each `$Vec` variant in `ctx.vecTypeMap` (or the externref array path);
       on match build `$IterRec{kind:3, obj:vec, idx:0}`, return as externref.
       Else `call __throw_type_error` ("is not iterable") then `ref.null.extern`.
     - `__iterator_next(externref)->(i32,externref)`: unwrap IterRec; switch `$kind`;
       kind=3: `idx < vec.length` ? push `(0, box(data[idx]))`, `idx++` : `(1, null.extern)`.
       Element boxing per the vec elem type via coerceType→externref.
     - `__iterator_return(externref)->()`: no-op for kind=3 (no user .return).
     - `__iterator_rest(externref)->externref`: loop next→build a fresh externref $Vec
       (reuse #1472 Blocker B materialization) — or defer to Slice 3 if not needed by
       Slice-1 consumers.
2. `index.ts`: split + gate (above).
3. `array-methods.ts:3090`: replace error → `ensureNativeIteratorRuntime` + emit the
   `$Vec` IterRec (values/keys/entries shapes — note `.values()`/`.keys()`/`.entries()`
   already lower natively in for-of via the #681 PR #1199 recognizer when the subject is
   `arr.values()` directly; this site is the *expression-position* `arr.entries()` that
   escapes to a generic iterable).
4. Tests: `tests/issue-1320-standalone.test.ts` — standalone for-of + spread + array-dstr
   over a `$Vec`-typed iterable that reaches the generic path; non-iterable → TypeError.

### Validation
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- Compile+run sample cases under `{target:"wasi"}` / `{nativeStrings:true}`.
- No new host imports (`result.imports` has no `__iterator*`).

## entries() continuation (dev-iter, 2026-06-05) — SHIPPED on this branch

`arr.entries()` in standalone/WASI now lowers natively (no host import). The
deferred refusal in `compileArrayIteratorMethod` is gone; `compileNativeArrayIterator`
builds each `[i, value]` slot as a 2-element `$ObjVec` (via `ensureObjVecBuilders`
→ `__objvec_new` + `__objvec_push`), mirroring `__object_entries`. The outer
canonical externref `$Vec` carries these pair externrefs; the consumer wraps it
through `__iterator`/`__iterator_next`/`__iterator_rest` exactly as values/keys do.

**Working consumers (zero `__iterator*`/`__array_*` host imports), tested in
`tests/issue-1320-standalone.test.ts`:**
- `[...arr.entries()]` spread (via native `__iterator_rest`) — array of pairs.
- `for (const pair of arr.entries())` drive + `pair.length === 2`.
- empty-receiver spread → length 0; `--target wasi` parity.
- values()/keys() (Slice 1) unchanged; JS-host `__array_entries` path untouched.

**Deferred to the open-any element-retrieval layer (#1888 S5b / #2177 Slice 1,
senior-dev) — NOT producer bugs:**
- `pair[0]`/`pair[1]` indexed read returns 0: `compileElementAccessBody`
  (property-access.ts:3525) routes externref element-access through `__extern_get`
  (key-based, $Object-only), never `__extern_get_idx` (which indexes $ObjVec).
- `for (const [k,v] of <stored entries()>)` array-dstr: tuple-from-iterable
  materialization (type-coercion.ts) leaks `env::__array_from_iter_n` + emits invalid
  wasm; pre-existing for ANY stored ref-pair iterator. The direct
  `for ([k,v] of arr.entries())` form is native via the #681 recognizer (works).

`$GenStateBase` (Slice 1b / kind=1 native generators) remains untouched.
