# #602 -- Tail call optimization: emit return_call for recursive functions

## Status: in-review
ts2wasm emits zero `return_call` or `return_call_ref` instructions. Both V8 and SpiderMonkey support the tail-call proposal. For recursive patterns (tree traversal, state machines, recursive descent), `return_call` eliminates stack growth and allows engines to reuse frames.

## Detection

A function call in return position: `return f(x)` -> emit `return_call` instead of `call` + `return`.

Covers: self-recursion, mutual recursion, generator trampolines, CPS-transformed async.

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added `return_call` and `return_call_ref` instruction types to the IR (`src/ir/types.ts`)
- Added opcodes `0x12` (return_call), `0x13` (return_call_indirect), `0x15` (return_call_ref) in `src/emit/opcodes.ts`
- Added binary emission for `return_call` and `return_call_ref` in `src/emit/binary.ts`
- Added WAT emission for `return_call` and `return_call_ref` in `src/emit/wat.ts`
- Modified `compileReturnStatement` in `src/codegen/statements.ts` to detect when the last emitted instruction is a `call` or `call_ref` and replace it with `return_call`/`return_call_ref`, skipping the explicit `return`
- Updated function index shifting in `shiftFuncIndices` (two call sites in `src/codegen/index.ts`) to handle `return_call`
- Updated string call collection/replacement optimizations to handle `return_call`
- Updated WAT type index analysis (`markNonFunc`) to handle `return_call_ref`
- Added `return_call` and `return_call_ref` to `INLINE_DISALLOWED_OPS` to prevent invalid inlining

### What worked
- The optimization is simple: after compiling the return expression (and any type coercion), check if the last instruction is a `call` or `call_ref`. If so, mutate it to the return variant and skip emitting `return`. This is safe because if coercion was needed, additional instructions follow the call, so the last instruction would not be a call.

### What didn't work initially
- The optimization accidentally made previously non-inlinable functions inlinable. Functions with `call` + `return` were blocked from inlining by `INLINE_DISALLOWED_OPS`, but after converting to `return_call` (removing both the `call` and `return`), the function became eligible for inlining. When inlined into a caller with a different return type, the `return_call` would return the wrong type. Fixed by adding `return_call`/`return_call_ref` to the disallowed set.

### Files changed
- `src/ir/types.ts` -- added return_call and return_call_ref to InstrBase union
- `src/emit/opcodes.ts` -- added return_call (0x12), return_call_indirect (0x13), return_call_ref (0x15)
- `src/emit/binary.ts` -- added binary encoding for return_call and return_call_ref
- `src/emit/wat.ts` -- added WAT text emission and markNonFunc for return_call_ref
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` -- tail call detection in compileReturnStatement
- `src/codegen/index.ts` -- shiftFuncIndices, string call opts, inline disallowed ops
- `tests/tail-call-optimization.test.ts` -- new test file with 5 test cases

### Tests now passing
- All 5 new tail call optimization tests pass
- No regressions in existing tests (verified against issue-277, closures, classes, arrays-enums, abstract-classes, anon-struct, array-methods, array-capacity)
