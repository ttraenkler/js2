# #469 — React milestone 3: hooks state machine

Implement a minimal hooks system (useState, useEffect) that compiles to Wasm. This is the core of React's component model — a linked list of hook states updated via closures.

## Approach
- Create a HookState struct with `memoizedState: number`, `next: HookState | null`
- Implement `useState(initialValue)` as a closure that reads/writes from the hook linked list
- Implement `useEffect(callback, deps)` with a simple dependency comparison
- Test: render a counter component, increment state, verify effect fires
- All deps already working: closures (#446), linked lists (#463), null narrowing (#462), Map (#458)
