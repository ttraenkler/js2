# #924 — Vite dev server OOMs or consumes 9GB+ loading the playground

## Problem

Running `pnpm run dev` (Vite dev server for the playground) consumes 9.4GB of RAM and often OOMs before the page loads. This makes local development impractical — the dev server alone uses half the container's 16GB RAM budget, leaving no room for test runs or dev agents.

### Root cause

`playground/main.ts` imports directly from `src/index.ts`, `src/optimize.ts`, and `src/runtime.ts`. Vite transforms the entire compiler source tree (~15K lines of codegen + TypeScript APIs) on every page load in dev mode. The `import-analysis` plugin parses every transitive import, exhausting the V8 heap.

### What was tried

1. **Pre-built bundles** (`scripts/compiler-bundle.mjs`, 3.2MB) — Vite still OOMs transforming the bundle because `import-analysis` parses all its exports
2. **`optimizeDeps.include/exclude`** — only works for `node_modules`, not local files
3. **`resolve.alias` to stubs** — works for `binaryen` but not for the compiler (need real exports)
4. **`--max-old-space-size=8192`** — prevents crash but uses 9.4GB, starving other processes

### Suggested approaches

1. **Separate playground Vite config with `src/` as external** — compile the playground entry point with esbuild into a single bundle first, then serve that bundle with Vite (no source tree crawling)
2. **Web worker for compilation** — move compiler imports into a Web Worker. The worker loads the pre-built bundle via `importScripts()` or dynamic `import()`, keeping it out of Vite's transform pipeline
3. **Vite plugin to serve `.mjs` bundles as raw static files** — intercept the import at the `load` hook and return the file without running `import-analysis` on it
4. **Pre-build step** — `esbuild` the playground into `playground-dist/` before starting Vite, then serve `playground-dist/` as a static site with HMR only for non-compiler files

### Acceptance criteria

- `pnpm run dev` starts in <5s and uses <500MB RSS
- Playground loads and compiles code correctly
- HMR works for playground UI changes (not required for compiler source changes — rebuild bundle for those)

## Current workaround

`NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'` in the dev script. Works but consumes 9.4GB.
