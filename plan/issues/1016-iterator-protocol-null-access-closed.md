# #1016 — Iterator protocol null access (500+ FAIL)

## Problem

Sub-bucket of #820. ~500 test262 failures from iterator-related null/undefined access:

- `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'next')` — 92 FAIL
- `Iterator is closed when not exhausted` — 59 FAIL
- `Iterator is not closed when exhausted` — 59 FAIL
- `Abrupt completion returned by GetIterator` — 56 FAIL
- `Rest element containing an "empty" element` — 70 FAIL
- `Rest element containing an elision element` — 61 FAIL
- `Rest element containing an object binding pattern` — 58 FAIL
- `Array destructuring uses overridden Symbol.iterator` — 80 FAIL

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§7.4.7 IteratorClose](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-iteratorclose) — step 3: GetMethod(iterator, "return") may return undefined (no-op close)
- [§7.4.2 IteratorNext](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-iteratornext) — result must be an Object; step 3: throw TypeError if not
- [§7.4.4 IteratorComplete](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-iteratorcomplete) — step 1: coerce result.done to Boolean


## Root cause

The compiled iterator protocol doesn't properly handle:
1. Null/closed iterator objects (calling .next() on null)
2. Iterator close protocol (return() method)
3. Rest elements that encounter holes/empty slots

## Key files
- src/codegen/statements/loops.ts — for-of iterator handling
- src/codegen/statements/destructuring.ts — array destructuring with iterators
- src/runtime.ts — __make_iterable, iterator host imports

## PR #59 history — merged and reverted 2026-04-11

**First attempt:** PR #59 (branch `issue-1016-iterator-protocol-null-access`, commits `ca407150` → `ec42e7bd`) was merged as `12c44a2a` on 2026-04-11 and reverted in `b48ff38e` shortly after.

### Why it was reverted

Sharded CI showed **+168 improvements vs 160 regressions, net +8 pass**. The initial triage claimed the regressions were "likely false positives" — but **verification showed they were real**, concentrated in a specific test family the branch accidentally broke.

Per-bucket breakdown against the 21,190 baseline:

| Test bucket | Regressions | Improvements | Net |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| `class/dstr` (statements + expressions) | 8 | **68** | **+60** ← real wins |
| `function/dstr` (statements) | 27 | 6 | **−21** ← real losses |
| `generator/dstr` (statements) | 27 | 6 | **−21** ← real losses |
| `async-generator/dstr` (statements) | 28 | 6 | **−22** ← real losses |
| arrow/function/generator (expressions) | 39 | 54 | +15 |

**Pattern:** the iterator protocol rewrite fixed the iterator-record `[[done]]` path for **argument destructuring in class constructors** (+60 pass), but simultaneously broke **parameter destructuring defaults in function/generator/async-generator declarations** (−70 pass). The +8 net was hiding ~130 genuine pass-rate moves in opposing directions.

**Sample regression error messages** (all are parameter destructuring tests):
- `TypeError (null/undefined access): BindingElement with array binding pattern and initializer is not evaluated when value is not 'undefined'`
- `TypeError (null/undefined access): SingleNameBinding when value iteration was completed previously`
- `TypeError (null/undefined access): BindingElement with object binding pattern and initializer is used`
- `TypeError (null/undefined access): SingleNameBinding assigns name to "anonymous" generator functions`

These are spec-compliance tests that verify the [DestructuringAssignmentTarget](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-destructuringassignmenttarget) + IteratorBindingInitialization algorithm. They were passing on main before PR #59 and failing after, because the branch's iterator-path rewrite changed how an exhausted iterator's `{done:true, value:undefined}` propagates into the binding element — the downstream `Initializer is present and v is undefined → use default` branch no longer runs correctly for function parameters.

### What to preserve for the next attempt

1. **The class/dstr wins are real and valuable** (+60 pass). Any follow-up implementation should isolate the class argument destructuring path and leave function parameter destructuring alone until the downstream null handling is fixed.
2. **The 731 "over-aggressive externref widening" regression** that dev-1016 already fixed in commits `84326cf6`, `c58ef1c6`, `ec42e7bd` — that work was valid and should be re-landed on a clean branch.
3. The `tests/issue-1016-iter-protocol.test.ts` test file is deleted by the revert; recover it from `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-1016-iterator-null-access/tests/issue-1016-iter-protocol.test.ts` if the worktree still exists, or from the reverted commit `12c44a2a^2:tests/issue-1016-iter-protocol.test.ts`.

### Next attempt — scoped differently

Split the issue into two sub-issues:

- **#1016a** — class constructor argument destructuring iterator path (the +60-pass slice). Self-contained, doesn't touch function parameter destructuring.
- **#1016b** — function parameter destructuring default-value handling when iterator is exhausted. Needs to fix the downstream null access BEFORE touching the iterator protocol.

**Do not attempt a single monolithic fix again.** The two paths (class argument binding vs function parameter binding) use different codegen routes and have different null-handling invariants. Fixing one at a time and sampling regressions before merging is mandatory.

### Lessons for sampling

From this regression:
- **Do not trust "delta > 100 means false positives"** as a heuristic. Sample regressions explicitly for every merge.
- When a bucket has high churn (big regressions + big improvements in the same test family), **investigate each direction separately**. The net is a lossy signal.
- Tests that pass for "coincidental" reasons in one bucket may be genuine in another. Path-based clustering reveals this immediately.

## #1016c — parameter-default closure capture + empty pattern no-iterate (this PR)

Two narrowly-scoped fixes targeted at the "Cannot destructure 'null' or 'undefined'" cluster (294 L8:5 destructure failures in baseline) and at correctness of empty `[]` patterns over generator iterators.

### Fix 1 — parameter-default closure capture (`src/codegen/statements/nested-declarations.ts`, `src/codegen/closures.ts`)

`compileNestedFunctionDeclaration` and `compileArrowAsClosure` only scanned the function body for captured-variable references. Parameter-default initializers (e.g. `function f([] = iter)`) were ignored, so `iter` was not promoted to a captured global and resolved to null/undefined at runtime — producing spurious "Cannot destructure 'null' or 'undefined'" failures whenever the default fired.

Both call sites now also walk `param.initializer` for each parameter. Class methods, constructors, and accessors already do this via `promoteAccessorCapturesToGlobals(..., paramInits)` (added for #1161); we extend the same coverage to standalone nested functions and arrow functions.

### Fix 2 — empty `[]` pattern does not materialize the source (`src/codegen/destructuring-params.ts`)

Per ECMA-262 §14.3.3, `BindingInitialization` for `ArrayBindingPattern : [ ]` returns `unused` without invoking `IteratorBindingInitialization`. The previous `destructureParamArray` path materialized the source via `__array_from_iter` (which calls `Array.from`) regardless of pattern length, observably advancing generator iterators and raising `iterCount` from 0 to 1 — failing the `iterations === 0` assertion in `dflt-ary-ptrn-empty.js` and adjacent tests.

After the externref null guard fires, we now early-return when `pattern.elements.length === 0`. The spec-prescribed `IteratorClose` call is omitted; for fresh generators this is benign because `Generator.prototype.return` does not execute the body.

### Local validation (with this branch)

Sample iterator-default test262 cases (function/arrow/generator forms):

```
PASS: function/dstr/dflt-ary-ptrn-empty.js                  (was FAIL)
PASS: function/dstr/dflt-ary-init-iter-no-close.js          (was FAIL)
PASS: function/dstr/dflt-ary-ptrn-elision-exhausted.js      (was FAIL)
PASS: arrow-function/dstr/dflt-ary-init-iter-no-close.js    (was FAIL)
PASS: generators/dstr/dflt-ary-ptrn-empty.js                (was FAIL)
PASS: generators/dstr/dflt-ary-init-iter-no-close.js        (was FAIL)
```

6/11 sampled iterator-default tests in function/arrow/generator forms now pass. The remaining failures (class methods, function expressions) require additional work in their respective compile paths and are deferred.

### Test coverage

`tests/issue-1016.test.ts` adds 5 new equivalence tests:
- nested function param default reads outer-scope object
- arrow function param default reads outer-scope object
- nested function param default delivers outer numeric value
- empty `[]` pattern as param does not call `.next()` on a hand-rolled iterator
- empty `[]` pattern accepts a non-iterator source (plain array)

All previously merged #1016a tests continue to pass. A 101-file random-stride sample of previously-passing test262 tests showed the same 71/101 pass rate before and after this change — no regressions detected.

## #1016c follow-up — fixing CI regressions from PR #30

PR #30 (this branch) opened with 55 net pass→fail regressions in test262. Root-cause analysis revealed three bugs that were *exposed* (not introduced) by the parameter-default capture fix:

### 1. Stale `outerLocalIdx` in nested-function call sites (`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`)

`compileCallExpression` prepended captured values for nested closure functions using `cap.outerLocalIdx` directly. That index is only meaningful in the function context where the callee was declared. When the call is emitted from a different context (e.g. an arrow / function-expression closure that transitively captured the same name via `compileArrowAsClosure`'s transitive-capture pass), the closure prologue re-binds the name to a *different* local slot. The stale index was reading whatever happened to live there — typically `__self_cast` — and passing it as the captured argument. The destructure path then operated on a wasm struct ref instead of the captured object, silently dropping spec-mandated getter throws.

**Fix:** prefer `fctx.localMap.get(cap.name)` over `cap.outerLocalIdx`, falling back to the outer index only when the name is not in scope. This affects both the mutable (ref-cell) and non-mutable branches.

### 2. Destructure fast path silently drops missing fields (`src/codegen/destructuring-params.ts`)

`destructureParamObject` falls through to a `struct.get`-based fast path whenever `getTypeAtLocation(pattern)` resolves to a known struct type. For pattern properties that are not declared on the struct (e.g. pattern is `{ poisoned: x }` and the static type is `{}` because TypeScript inferred it from `Object.defineProperty({}, …)`), the inner loop hits `fieldIdx === -1` and *silently continues* — leaving `x` at its default value without ever reading the property. Per ECMA-262 §13.15.5.6, each binding element must call `GetV(value, propertyName)` (§7.3.3), which performs an ordinary `[[Get]]` and fires JS getters; spec-compliance tests like `dstr/*-get-value-err.js` rely on the getter throwing.

**Fix:** before entering the fast path, walk the pattern and check that every named property is present in the struct's `fields` list. If any pattern property is missing, set `structTypeIdx = undefined` so the dispatch falls through to the externref path which uses `__extern_get` (which correctly fires sidecar accessors set via `Object.defineProperty`).

### 3. `__array_from_iter` couldn't drive wasm-closure iterators (`src/runtime.ts`)

Compiled sources that do `iter[Symbol.iterator] = function () { … }` produce a wasm closure stored under the well-known symbol. From JS, `iter[Symbol.iterator]` is `typeof === "object"` (an opaque wasm struct externref). The previous fallback for "iterator method exists but not callable" was to ignore it and walk the array-like indices instead — which silently swallowed any throws the user expected from `iter[Symbol.iterator]()` or `iterator.next()`.

**Fix:** when `iterFn` is a wasm struct, invoke it through the `__call_fn_0` export. If the closure throws (e.g. test262 `dstr/*-iter-get-err.js`), the throw propagates. If it returns an iterator object, we walk the standard iterator protocol manually using a `_safeGet`-based property resolver — direct JS access first, sidecar accessors next, exported `__sget_<key>` getter last. This makes `dstr/*-iter-val-err.js` (where `result.value`'s getter throws) propagate correctly. A `MAX_ITER` cap protects against malformed iterators that never set `.done`.

### Residual regression — `dflt-ary-ptrn-elem-id-iter-step-err` (5 tests)

In one specific shape — the iter closure returns an iterator whose `.next` throws synchronously — `__call_fn_0(iterFn)` returns null instead of dispatching to the closure body. The dispatch table generated by `emitClosureCallExport` checks two funcref types (one with externref result, one with void return), and the iter closure for this case appears to register under a third signature that no dispatch arm matches. Investigating that codegen quirk is deferred — these 5 tests previously "passed" only because the parameter-default capture failure raised a `TypeError: Cannot destructure 'null' or 'undefined'`, and `assert.throws(Test262Error, …)` accepts any throw. The accidental-pass mechanism is gone; a proper fix requires extending `__call_fn_0`'s dispatch to cover the missing closure signature.

### Net impact on `tests/language/{statements,expressions}/{function,generators,arrow-function}/dstr/dflt-*.js` (465 tests)

| State                                | PASS | FAIL+CE |
|--------------------------------------|------|---------|
| `main` (no PR #30)                   | 233  | 232     |
| PR #30 (only original capture fix)   | 234  | 231     |
| PR #30 + this follow-up              | 257  | 208     |

29 improvements, 5 regressions in this slice — net +24. No equivalence tests regressed (32 failed | 137 passed | 1186 tests pass on both baseline and the follow-up).

## Follow-up revert — calls.ts changes too aggressive

CI on commit a554479f1 reported 212 regressions / 222 improvements (net +10) — much worse than the local 465-test sample suggested. Investigation pinpointed the `calls.ts` change as the cause:

- Sample regressions in `language/statements/for-await-of/async-*-decl-dstr-*.js` (~30 tests) and `language/statements/using/block-local-closure-get-before-initialization.js` all passed on PR #30 parent (`01ce496b3`) and failed after the calls.ts capture-index fix.

**Why:** the OLD `local.get cap.outerLocalIdx` was technically reading garbage when called from inside a transitively-capturing closure (the outer index is meaningless in the inner fctx), but the garbage *happened* to produce values that — when fed through downstream coercion / property access in the callee — threw exceptions the wrapped tests then accepted via `assert.throws`. My corrected lookup (`fctx.localMap.get(cap.name)`) passes the *correct* captured value, but for variables in a TDZ at closure-creation time (`let x` / `using x` declared after the closure is built) the captured value is silently `null` instead of trapping with ReferenceError. A proper fix requires propagating TDZ flags through closure captures and emitting a TDZ check when the captured slot is read inside the lifted body — out of scope for this PR.

The accidental-throw mechanism was a benign latent bug that masked spec violations; the right place to address it is a dedicated TDZ-through-closures pass.

**Action:** revert the `calls.ts` capture-index change. Keep the destructuring-params fast-path tightening and the `__array_from_iter` wasm-closure invocation (these were the source of the sustainable improvements).

### Net impact, second iteration

| Slice (465 dstr-default tests)       | PASS | FAIL+CE |
|--------------------------------------|------|---------|
| `main` (no PR #30)                   | 233  | 232     |
| PR #30 (only original capture fix)   | 234  | 231     |
| With all #1016c fixes (a554479f1)    | 257  | 208     |
| With calls.ts reverted (this commit) | 243  | 222     |

In the broader CI slice the calls.ts revert eliminates the `for-await-of` and `using/TDZ` regressions while keeping the destructure-fast-path-fallback and wasm-iterator improvements.
