# #6687 — S3-a: `C_method` invalid Wasm under the native regime (JS env)

Slice S3-a of the #5385 "Implementation Plan v2". ~600 nightly rows
(`language/statements/class/dstr/async-gen-meth-*`, `async-gen-private-meth-*`)
in the native-first measurement lane fail with

```
invalid Wasm binary (WebAssembly.Module(): Compiling function #110:"C_method" failed:
  not enough arguments on the stack for call (need 4, got 1)
```

(`C___priv_method` for the private-method siblings; the "stack-balance" variant
is the same defect caught earlier by the #N balance checker). The same tests
pass in BOTH the host lane and the standalone lane.

## Reproduction (measured 2026-09-26, main @ 0631fa543e)

Compile `test262/test/language/statements/class/dstr/async-gen-meth-static-ary-init-iter-close.js`
through the real assembled harness (`assembleOriginalHarness(source, parseMeta(source)).primary.source`,
`skipSemanticDiagnostics: true`, `inferModuleStrictArguments: false`) under three
profiles:

| profile                                                | result                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `semanticProviders: "native-first"` + `JS2WASM_NATIVE_REGIME_JS=1` | **INVALID** (need 4, got 1)      |
| `target: "standalone"`                                 | valid                            |
| default `gc`                                           | valid                            |

A bare `compile()` of the class alone (no harness) is valid in all three
profiles — the defect needs the harness's iterator shapes in the module, i.e.
the late-import / index-shift regime described below. Do not reduce it to a
snippet; use the assembled source (the probe is in
`.tmp/` style: read file → `parseMeta` → `assembleOriginalHarness` → `compile`
with `emitWat: true`).

## Root cause (from the WAT diff regime vs standalone, same source)

In `C_method`, the array-pattern parameter materializer boxes an f64 element
to externref. The regime build emits

```
local.get 11            ;; f64 element
i32.trunc_sat_f64_s
call 81                 ;; resolves to __num_ryu_to_buf (4 params) — WRONG callee
```

while the standalone build inlines the smi box (`$smi_box_f64` / `ref.i31`
sequence) at the same site. `call 81` is a **stale-low function index**: the
arm captured `ctx.funcMap.get("__box_number")` before `addUnionImports` /
`ensureObjectRuntime` inserted imports and shifted every defined-function
index — the exact hazard the comment at
`src/codegen/destructuring-params.ts` ≈ L628–L636 documents for
`__extern_length` / `__extern_get_idx` (and fixes there by re-reading the name
post-shift). Under standalone the `__box_number` name is never consulted on
this path (the `(ctx.standalone || ctx.wasi)` arm inlines instead); under the
regime in a JS environment an environment-shaped sibling arm still registers
the host `__box_number` import late, so the name resolves to a stale index.

Candidate sites in `src/codegen/destructuring-params.ts` (all read
`ctx.funcMap.get("__box_number")` without a post-shift re-read):
≈ L591, L603, L650, L673 (`boxElementInstrs`-style helper by `storageKind`),
≈ L1140–L1145 (default-initializer boxing), and the fallback materializer
around ≈ L2269 (`i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` site). Confirm which one owns byte
offset `@+276996` by dumping the WAT (the probe prints `call N` lines).

## Fix (spec)

1. Route every f64/i32 → externref box in this file through the ONE shared
   boxing helper that already honors the regime (the standalone inline smi-box
   path used by `boxToExternref` in `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts`); do not
   add a fourth copy of the `__box_number` lookup.
2. Where a host `__box_number` call is legitimately kept (host-assisted
   profile only), resolve the index AFTER `flushLateImportShifts` / by name at
   emit time, matching the ≈ L633 pattern.
3. Add the assembled-harness repro as a focused test (three profiles; assert
   `new WebAssembly.Module(binary)` validates under the regime, and that the
   default `gc` and `standalone` binaries are byte-identical to before).

Do NOT change the async-generator carrier or the class-method dispatch
trampolines; the WAT diff shows the divergence is confined to the element
boxing site.

## Acceptance

- [ ] The three repro files (`async-gen-meth-static-ary-init-iter-close.js`,
      `async-gen-meth-ary-name-iter-val.js`,
      `async-gen-meth-static-dflt-ary-ptrn-rest-ary-elem.js`) validate and
      pass under `JS2WASM_EVAL_ENGINE=interpreter TEST262_SEMANTIC_PROVIDERS=native-first TEST262_PATH_FILTER=… pnpm run test:262`.
      — **validate: yes; pass: blocked** on a general async residual, see Test Results.
- [x] `tests/issue-4396-target-profile.test.ts` byte-identity green; standalone
      output for the repro byte-identical (assert in the focused test).
- [x] 321-row sample not below the S1/S2 number (219 → 219).
- [ ] Nightly lane: the `C_method`/`C___priv_method` "not enough arguments" and
      "stack-balance" signatures drop to zero (record the before/after).
      — pending the first nightly after merge.

## Resolution (2026-09-26, opus-6687)

**The root cause is not in `destructuring-params.ts`.** Instrumenting the capture
shows `boxToExternref` reads a *fresh* `__box_number` index (107 with 44 imports).
The index goes stale later: while the method's `__async_resume_fmethod` function
compiles, three JS-environment late imports land (`ensureNativeProxyRuntime` via the
global-object seed, then two eval-runtime flushes in `emitStandaloneIndirectEvalRuntime`).
At that moment the `C_method` body is reachable from no shifter root (not
`mod.functions`, `funcStack`, `savedBodies` nor `liveBodies`), so its baked
`call 107` missed three `+1` shifts; `__box_number` moved to 110 and the call hit
what became `__num_ryu_to_buf`. Standalone never adds those imports (16 imports,
stable), so the same site is correct there. `__extern_length`/`__extern_get_idx` in
the same prologue are imports at that point (below the shift base), which is why
only the defined `__box_number` broke.

**Fix:** native `__box_number` is minted through the #1916 S3 stable-handle regime
(`mintDefinedFunc` + `pushDefinedFunc`, resolved at emit; shifters skip it by
construction) in a new `pushNativeUnionHelper` in `src/codegen/registry/imports.ts`.
Same physical slot, so the binary is identical wherever the live index was
already correct. No change to the async-generator carrier, class-method
trampolines, or `destructuring-params.ts`.

**Not done here (deliberately):** the general hazard remains for any other
*live-regime defined* function baked into a class async-gen method prologue — the
unreachable-body window in the carrier is the real gap. Closing it means
registering the method body as a live body during the resume compile, which is
carrier work this slice was told not to touch.

## Test Results

| guard | before (upstream/main 435dd3fcd0) | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| repro, regime (3 files) | INVALID `C_method` need 4, got 1 | valid |
| repro, standalone sha256 prefix | 72bb293f / 5733a4f8 / 80278fc0 | identical |
| repro, default gc sha256 prefix | 2a5aecaf / 97077e94 / 62d635ff | identical |
| `tests/issue-4396-target-profile.test.ts` | 12/12 | 12/12 |
| new `tests/issue-6687-native-regime-async-gen-meth-dstr.test.ts` | 1 fail / 1 pass | 2/2 |
| 321-row sample (native-first, interpreter eval) | 219 pass | 219 pass (no flips in pass/fail) |
| `tests/issue-4397-native-semantic-js-host.test.ts` (regime env) | 19 red / 11 green | same 19 / 11 |
| box suites (#1916, #3024, #3315, #3673, #4157) | 5 pre-existing reds | same 5 |

Scoped test262 on the three repros (both `statements/` and `expressions/` variants, 6 rows):
before = invalid Wasm; after on main = `async completion marker not observed` (the S1 #6685
signature); after with the S1 branch (a58d9e5d5a) merged locally =
`async continuation threw before completion: Cannot convert object to primitive value`.
The same message appears on a plain control, `statements/async-function/evaluation-body-that-returns-after-await.js`,
so it is a general async/console-boundary residual, not this defect. **The acceptance line
"validate and pass" is only half met: they validate; passing is blocked on that residual.**

Re-measured after merging upstream main with S1 landed (`fcb3ed03e7`): same six rows,
same `Cannot convert object to primitive value`; focused test + #4396 green.
