# Issue 46: Linear-memory compilation backend

## Summary

Add a `{ target: "linear" }` compilation option that emits standard Wasm with
linear memory instead of WasmGC. This enables compiling `src/link/` into a
portable `linker.wasm` that runs in any Wasm runtime (Wasmtime, Wasmer, Wamr,
browsers).

## Design

See [../2026-03-01-linear-memory-backend-design.md](../2026-03-01-linear-memory-backend-design.md).

## Scope

- New `src/codegen-linear/` module with linear-memory codegen
- Runtime functions (__malloc, __map_*, __arr_*, __str_*, __u8arr_*) emitted
  into output module
- Bump allocator, 8-byte-aligned object headers
- Compiler option `{ target: "linear" }` in CompileOptions
- Only TS features used by `src/link/` need to work
- Tests: unit tests for runtime functions, integration test, linker self-host
  test, Wasmtime validation

## Complexity

L — new codegen module, runtime library, memory layout, multiple test layers
