# Issue #208: Computed property names with complex expressions

**Status**: in-review
## Problem

15 test262 tests fail where computed property names use expressions (addition,
ternary, coalesce, template literals) as keys. The `resolveComputedKeyExpression`
function only handled string literals, numeric literals, const variable references
with direct string literal initializers, and enum members. The more comprehensive
`resolveConstantExpression` already handled binary arithmetic and const variable
references recursively, but `resolveComputedKeyExpression` didn't delegate to it.

## Solution

1. **Simplified `resolveComputedKeyExpression`**: Removed duplicated logic for
   string/numeric literals and const variable references. Now only keeps the
   enum-specific lookup (which `resolveConstantExpression` can't handle), then
   delegates to `resolveConstantExpression` for all other cases.

2. **Extended `resolveConstantExpression`** with support for:
   - Conditional (ternary) expressions: `cond ? a : b`
   - Nullish coalescing: `a ?? b`
   - Template expressions: `` `prefix${expr}suffix` ``
   - No-substitution template literals: `` `hello` ``

## Files changed

- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — `resolveConstantExpression` extended with
  ternary, coalesce, and template literal support; `resolveComputedKeyExpression`
  simplified to delegate to it.
- `tests/equivalence.test.ts` — 5 new tests for computed property names with
  addition, ternary, template literal, numeric expressions, and const variable
  expressions.

## Tests

5 new equivalence tests, all passing:
- computed property name with addition expression
- computed property name with ternary expression
- computed property name with template literal
- computed property name with numeric expression
- computed property name with const variable expression
