# Issue #145: allowJs type flexibility — boolean/string/void as number

## Status: Done

## Problem
497 test262 compile errors from TypeScript type checking rejecting valid JS patterns:
- "Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'" (277)
- "Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'" (178)
- "Argument of type 'void' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'" (42)

## Root Causes Found
1. **void -> number coercion**: When a void expression was used where a value was expected (function arg, variable init, ternary branch), `compileExpression` returned null without pushing any value onto the wasm stack, causing `WebAssembly.CompileError: not enough arguments on the stack`.

2. **void in ternary branches**: `compileConditionalExpression` didn't handle void branches — no value was pushed, causing stack underflow in the wasm if/else block.

3. **void as condition**: TS diagnostic 1345 ("An expression of type 'void' cannot be tested for truthiness") was not downgraded to a warning, blocking compilation.

4. **boolean -> number / string -> number**: Already handled correctly by `coerceType` (i32->f64 via `f64.convert_i32_s`, externref->f64 via `__unbox_number`). The TS diagnostics 2345/2322 were already downgraded.

## Changes

### `src/codegen/expressions.ts`
- **`compileExpression`** (line ~70): When result is VOID_RESULT and expectedType is set, push a typed default value (NaN for f64, matching JS `Number(undefined)` semantics) instead of returning null.
- **`compileConditionalExpression`**: When a ternary branch produces void (null), push `f64.const NaN` to ensure the branch has a value. Default type for void branches changed from i32 to f64.
- **`compileConditionalExpression`**: When condition is void, push `i32.const 0` (falsy) instead of reporting an error.

### `src/compiler.ts`
- Added TS diagnostic codes to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES`:
  - 1345: "An expression of type 'void' cannot be tested for truthiness"
  - 2350: "Only a void function can be called with the 'new' keyword"
