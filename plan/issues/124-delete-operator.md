# Issue 124: delete operator

## Summary

232 test262 tests use the `delete` operator. Currently all skipped.

## Problem

`delete obj.prop` removes a property from an object at runtime. In wasm with
WasmGC structs, fields are fixed at compile time and cannot be removed.

## Approach

Could be partially supported for Map/object-as-map patterns where properties
are stored in a hashtable. For struct-based objects, delete is meaningless.

## Complexity

M — Partial support for dynamic objects only.
