origin: surfaced during PR #74 (#1186) escalation. Committed `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl` says 25387 pass; PR #74 actually produces 27021 pass — gap of +1634 tests passing that the committed baseline doesn't reflect.

# #1191 — Committed `test262-current.jsonl` is far behind reality

## Problem

The committed baseline file `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl`
in `main` reports **25387 passing tests**. PR #74's CI run produces
**27021 passing tests** against the same compiler state — a gap of
**+1634 tests** that the committed baseline doesn't reflect.

This baseline is the second source of truth for the dev-self-merge
gate (the first being the `js2wasm-baselines` repo's mirror, which
has its own 26005-pass figure — also stale, but less so).

The gap matters because:

  1. The `dev-self-merge.md` skill (Step 4) instructs devs to
     compute regressions vs `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl`.
     With a 1634-test gap, EVERY PR appears to be massively positive —
     OR the comparison is silently broken for any test that's been
     fixed since the baseline was last committed.

  2. PR #74's tech-lead-recommended check ("compare against committed
     baseline") works in this PR's case (PR #74 lands at +1634 vs
     25387) but the absolute numbers don't reflect anything stable
     about the repo state.

  3. The drift compounds. Every uncommitted-baseline week makes the
     committed file more stale, eroding the metric's signal.

## Why is the baseline stale?

The git log shows `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl` was last
committed 2025-09-25 (commit `3302425e4`). The file uses LFS-style
chunking (47 lines per chunk), but the test262 baseline now lives
in the separate `js2wasm-baselines` repo — and the committed copy
hasn't been refreshed since the migration. See git log:

```
3302425e4 chore(test262): refresh results — 25387/43168 pass     (2025-09-25)
616a7a528 chore(lfs): migrate JSONL and benchmark runs out of LFS  (newer)
```

The MIGRATION commit moved the canonical store off LFS, but the
in-repo file was left in its pre-migration state.

## Fix

### A. One-time refresh (immediate)

Generate a fresh `test262-current.jsonl` from a current main run
(e.g. PR #74's merged report once it lands) and commit it. Single
PR, ~1 hour to execute manually.

### B. Automated periodic refresh (recurring)

Add a workflow that:
  1. Runs nightly (or on merges to main from any compiler-source-changing
     PR — gated on path filter `src/**/*.ts`)
  2. Pulls the latest test262 results from the most-recent `main`
     CI run
  3. Opens an auto-PR titled `chore(test262): refresh committed baseline
     to N pass`
  4. Fast-forward auto-merges if `net_per_test == 0` against the
     prior committed baseline (i.e., it's just a baseline state
     update, no test diff).

Cost: ~1 PR/day. Cheap.

### C. Stop using the committed baseline as a merge gate (alternative)

If we accept that the committed file will always lag, we could just
delete it from the merge gate and ONLY use the `js2wasm-baselines`
repo. But that doubles down on the cache-stale problem (#1189). So
keep the committed file, refresh it.

I recommend **A + B together**. C is an option of last resort.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl` refreshed to within
   N tests of the latest main CI run. After refresh, the
   `dev-self-merge` skill's "vs committed" comparison produces
   sensible numbers (no PR shows +1500 pass on a docs-only diff).

2. Automated workflow merges baseline-refresh PRs without manual
   intervention when the only change is the baseline file itself.

3. Document in `CLAUDE.md` (Test262 section) which file is
   authoritative + how often it refreshes.

## Out of scope

- Fixing the cache-staleness in `js2wasm-baselines` repo (that's
  #1189).
- Choosing the "final" merge-gate metric (that's #1190).

## Notes

- Be careful: the "fresh test262 run" must come from a CLEAN cache
  (fix #1189 first, OR run with `force_baseline_refresh=YES` via
  `refresh-baseline.yml`). Otherwise the new committed baseline
  would inherit the same stale-pass entries that confused PR
  #72 / #74.

- Suggest landing #1189 BEFORE this issue. The fix order is:
  #1189 (cache fix) → #1191 (one-time refresh on clean cache) →
  ongoing automation.

## Implementation (2026-04-28)

Part A (automation) implemented as a new dedicated workflow:
`.github/workflows/refresh-committed-baseline.yml`.

Design:
  - Triggers via `workflow_run` after `Test262 Sharded` completes —
    transitively path-filtered (the sharded workflow itself filters
    on `src/**`, `scripts/**`, etc.), so it only fires when compiler
    source changed.
  - Also triggerable manually via `workflow_dispatch`. Manual mode
    finds the most-recent main sharded run whose `merge shard reports`
    job succeeded (overall run may show failure if regression-gate
    flagged regressions — the merged JSONL artifact is still valid).
  - Downloads the `test262-merged-report` artifact (cheap — no
    test262 re-run).
  - Sanity-checks pass/total to reject corrupt reports.
  - Replaces `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl` and pushes
    to main with `[skip ci]` in the commit message so it does not
    retrigger CI workflows.
  - Race-condition handling: if another `[skip ci]` commit lands
    while we are running, fall back to fetch + reset + reapply.

Why a separate workflow (not modifying `test262-sharded.yml`):
  - Decouples concerns: the sharded workflow is about *running*
    test262 and gating regressions; the new workflow is about
    *syncing* the committed snapshot.
  - Easier to disable, test, or revert in isolation.
  - Mirrors the existing pattern of `deploy-pages.yml` being
    triggered downstream of `Test262 Sharded`.

Why no PR with auto-merge:
  - This is a pure snapshot state update (no source change), so a
    regression check is meaningless — the JSONL is by construction
    the result of the latest CI run on the same SHA. A direct
    `[skip ci]` push mirrors what the sharded workflow already does
    for the JSON file, and avoids two redundant workflow runs (one
    for the auto-PR, one for the auto-merge).

Part B (one-time manual refresh):
  Skipped for now. As of 2026-04-28, no recent main `Test262 Sharded`
  run has overall status `success` (all flagged by the regression
  gate, which is itself unreliable per #1190). Once #1189 (cache
  fix) lands and a clean run completes, the new workflow can be
  triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch` to do the catch-up
  refresh — no further code changes needed.

Documentation: added a "Baseline files (which is authoritative?)"
table to the Test262 section of `CLAUDE.md` so future devs know
which file feeds which gate and how each one is refreshed.
