# #381 -- Nullish coalescing false positives

## Status: open

4 tests fail with "This expression is never nullish" -- a TypeScript compiler false positive when running in allowJs mode.

## Details

```javascript
var x = someValue ?? defaultValue;
// TS infers someValue is never null/undefined and errors
```

TypeScript's type checker can determine that an expression is never nullish based on its type inference. However, in plain JavaScript (allowJs mode), the types are inferred from usage and may not be accurate, leading to false positives.

Fix: add the diagnostic code for "This expression is never nullish" (TS2880 or similar) to the `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` list in index.ts so it becomes a warning instead of an error.

## Complexity: XS

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Nullish coalescing on "never nullish" expressions compiles without error
- [ ] Diagnostic is downgraded, not suppressed entirely
- [ ] 4 previously failing compile errors are resolved
