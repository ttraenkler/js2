# #1230 — Post-dispatch fork starvation in test262 CompilerPool

## Problem

After PR #131 fixed the queue-wait timer artefact (#1227), the
`compile_timeout` count dropped from 156 → 86. A per-test subprocess
probe over those 86 residuals found:

- **9 / 86** are genuine runtime infinite loops in our Wasm shim
  (clusters tracked in #1228 + #1229)
- **4 / 86** are baseline drift (file not found in `test262/`)
- **73 / 86** finish in <1 s in isolation but still hit the 30 s pool
  ceiling in actual CI runs

The 73 finish-in-isolation entries are the residual contention
artefact: even after the dispatch-time timer fix, a fork that has
*accepted* a job can be CPU-starved through 30 s of wall-clock.

## Hypothesised mechanisms (need data to discriminate)

| # | Mechanism | Easy to test |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Pool over-subscribed** — 9 forks competing for ~9 logical cores plus the master process. Under load, individual forks lose CPU time for stretches that exceed the timeout. | Drop pool from 9 to 7, re-run, see if count drops. |
| 2 | **GC pause overlap** — when several forks all hit GC simultaneously (each fork has ~256–512 MB of compiler state), the OS may serialise GC pauses, stalling some forks for seconds. | Use `--expose-gc` in workers, log GC time, correlate with timeout victims. |
| 3 | **JIT tier-up cliff** — the first time a fork's V8 tier-ups a hot codegen path can take seconds. If a job arrives during tier-up, its wall-clock balloons. | Log `process.cpuUsage()` deltas per job; tier-up shows as a CPU-bound ~2-5 s spike. |
| 4 | **IPC backpressure** — `process.send()` between master and many forks may serialise in `node` internals; large response payloads (compiled binary base64 in compile-only mode) can stall the IPC loop and delay timer callbacks. | Already partially mitigated by writing wasm to disk and only sending metadata. Profile IPC times. |
| 5 | **Master-process GC stalls** — the master holds all `pending` and `queue` state; if its GC pauses, fork responses queue up and timers run while the response is in-buffer. | Log master `process.hrtime()` between message events; long gaps indicate stalls. |

## Investigation plan

This issue is **investigation, not implementation**. The deliverable is
a follow-up issue (or several) with specific fixes once a mechanism is
confirmed. Expected effort: 1–2 days of targeted instrumentation.

### Step 1 — instrument the pool

In `scripts/compiler-pool.ts`, log per-job:

- `enqueue_ts` (when added to queue)
- `dispatch_ts` (when sent to fork)
- `response_ts` (when fork's message arrived)
- `cpu_user_ms`, `cpu_system_ms` (from `process.cpuUsage()` snapshots)

For timeout-killed jobs, also log:

- Which fork held the job
- That fork's CPU usage in the timeout window
- Wall-clock vs CPU-clock for that fork

### Step 2 — bisect pool size

Re-run the test262 sharded workflow with `POOL_SIZE` set to 5, 6, 7,
8, 9. Each run should produce a `compile_timeout` count. Plot count vs
pool size. If timeouts fall off a cliff at 7 or below, mechanism #1 is
likely dominant.

### Step 3 — measure GC overlap

Add `--max-old-space-size=256 --expose-gc` to forks and have them log
each GC pause to a per-fork file. Correlate with timeout victims:
does each timeout coincide with a GC pause in that fork?

### Step 4 — recommend a fix

Depending on what the data shows, file one of:

- **#1230a** — drop default pool size from 9 to 7 (if mechanism 1)
- **#1230b** — stagger fork creation to avoid GC overlap (if mechanism 2)
- **#1230c** — wait for fork warm-up before dispatching (if mechanism 3)
- **#1230d** — chunk IPC payloads / use `worker_threads` instead of
  `child_process` (if mechanism 4 or 5)

## Why not just lower the timeout?

Phase 3 of #1207 proposed dropping the 30 s ceiling to 10 s. That's
*safe* now (every honest compile is <1 s in isolation) but it'd just
convert these 73 phantom timeouts into 73 `fail` entries in CI. Not a
fix; it'd add CI noise. The fix is to figure out what's actually
stalling the forks and address it; then the 73 phantom timeouts go
away on their own and the lower ceiling becomes a defensive guardrail
rather than a noise generator.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `plan/notes/test262-pool-starvation.md` exists with:
   - Per-job timing data from instrumented pool
   - Pool-size bisection results (5 → 9 forks)
   - Per-mechanism evidence (GC overlap, tier-up cliffs, IPC stalls, master GC stalls)
   - Conclusion: which mechanism(s) dominate the 73 phantom timeouts
2. A follow-up issue (#1230a / b / c / d) is filed with a concrete fix.
3. (Stretch) After the fix lands, the residual `compile_timeout` count
   drops below 20 in the next baseline refresh.

## Out of scope

- Genuine runtime hangs (#1228, #1229). These are independent.
- Phase 3 of #1207 (lower the 30 s ceiling). Wait until this issue's
  fix has landed, otherwise the count merely shifts to `fail`.
