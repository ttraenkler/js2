# #678 — Dynamic prototype chain traversal

## Status: open

#631 added static prototype patterns. ~625 tests need dynamic traversal.

### Approach
1. Each struct gets an optional `__proto__` externref field pointing to parent prototype
2. Property access fallback: if field not found on struct, check `__proto__` chain via host import `__proto_get(obj, "prop") -> externref`
3. `for-in` loop: walk prototype chain collecting enumerable keys
4. `instanceof`: walk `__proto__` chain checking against constructor.prototype

The `__proto__` field is only allocated for classes with inheritance. Cost: 1 externref field + 1 host call per prototype-chain property miss.

## Complexity: L
