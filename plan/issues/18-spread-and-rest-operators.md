# Issue 18: Spread and Rest Operators

## Status: done

## Summary
Support spread (`...arr`) in array literals and function calls, and rest parameters (`...args`) in function declarations.

## Motivation
Spread/rest are essential for working with arrays and variadic functions in TypeScript.

## Design

### Array spread
```ts
const combined = [...a, ...b];
const copy = [...original];
```
Compile as: create new array, iterate sources and push each element.

### Function call spread
```ts
Math.max(...numbers);
```
Complex — WASM functions have fixed arity. Options:
- For known host functions: unroll if array length is known at compile time
- For general case: pass the array as externref and let the host handle `Function.apply`

### Rest parameters
```ts
function sum(...nums: number[]): number {
  let total = 0;
  for (const n of nums) total += n;
  return total;
}
```
The rest parameter becomes a WASM GC array. Callers pack trailing arguments into an array.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: spread in array literals
- `src/codegen/index.ts` + `statements.ts`: rest parameters in function declarations
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts`: spread in function calls (limited)

## Complexity: L

## Out of scope
- Object spread (`{ ...obj }`)
- Spread in `new` expressions

## Acceptance criteria
- `[...a, ...b]` creates a combined array
- `[1, ...arr, 2]` interleaves correctly
- `function f(...args: number[])` collects arguments into array
- `f(1, 2, 3)` at call site packs into rest array
