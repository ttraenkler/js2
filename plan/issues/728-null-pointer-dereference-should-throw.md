# #728 -- Null pointer dereference should throw TypeError, not trap (1,604 tests)

## Status: superseded by #775

Partial work was done (commits 1249867e, 5976d86a, a7313092, 5265ab61, 4cabe36d) but the post-processing approach caused regressions and was reverted (19cedca9). #775 replaces this with a refined codegen-time approach.

## Problem

1,604 tests fail with "RuntimeError: dereferencing a null pointer" -- a Wasm trap that crashes the module instead of throwing a catchable TypeError. The test262 harness expects these to be catchable exceptions (via `assert.throws(TypeError, ...)`), but Wasm traps cannot be caught by Wasm try/catch.

Issue #695 addressed this for some property access paths, but many code paths still produce raw Wasm traps instead of throwing via the exception tag.

### Code paths that still trap

1. **Method calls on null** -- `null.toString()`, `undefined.valueOf()` go through `compileCallExpression` which dereferences the receiver without a null check
2. **Element access on null** -- `null[0]`, `undefined["key"]` in `compileElementAccess`
3. **Iteration on null** -- `for (let x of null)` tries to get iterator from null
4. **Spread on null** -- `[...null]` tries to iterate null
5. **Destructuring null** -- `let {a} = null` tries to access properties on null
6. **Operator on null object** -- `null + 1` where null is typed as object, not primitive
7. **Function call on null** -- `nullFn()` dereferences null function ref
8. **Constructor on null** -- `new nullCtor()` dereferences null

### Fix approach

For each code path above, add a null check before the dereference:

```wasm
local.tee $tmp
ref.is_null
if
  ;; throw TypeError via exception tag
  ref.null extern
  throw $exnTag
end
local.get $tmp
;; ... proceed with dereference
```

This is the same pattern used in #695's `emitNullGuardedStructGet` but applied to more code paths.

### Priority order (by test count impact)

1. Method calls on null (~500 tests)
2. Element access on null (~300 tests)
3. Destructuring null (~200 tests)
4. Iteration/spread on null (~200 tests)
5. Function/constructor call on null (~150 tests)
6. Remaining paths (~254 tests)

## Complexity: M

## Acceptance criteria

- 1,604 tests that currently trap with "dereferencing a null pointer" instead throw a catchable exception
- No new regressions
- Wasm try/catch blocks can catch the thrown exceptions
