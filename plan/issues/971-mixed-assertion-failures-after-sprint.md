# #971 — Mixed assertion failures (~180 tests)

## Problem

~180 tests fail with various assertion errors that don't fit the major regression buckets. These are the long tail after fixing Array methods (#967), block scope (#968), and misc methods (#969).

## Approach

Re-analyze after #967-#969 are fixed — many of these may resolve as side effects. The remaining ones need individual investigation via error analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Analyze remaining failures after #967-#969
- Fix any that are regressions from sprint 38 merges
- Document any that are pre-existing or correctness improvements

## Implementation Summary

### Root Cause Analysis

The primary regression was in **array rest element destructuring** (`[x, ...y] = [1, 2, 3]`).

**Root cause (literals.ts):** When compiling an array literal as the RHS of a destructuring assignment with a rest element, the TS contextual type gives a tuple type with fewer slots than the literal's elements. For `[x, ...y] = [10, 20, 30]`, the contextual type is `[number, number]` (2 slots), so `compileTupleLiteral` only emitted 2 values — silently dropping the third element. The rest element handler then saw a tuple struct (not a vec struct) and skipped, leaving `y` unmodified.

### Fixes Applied (3 changes)

1. **`src/codegen/literals.ts`** — In `compileArrayLiteral`, when the contextual tuple type has fewer element positions than the array literal has elements, skip the tuple path and fall through to the vec struct path. This prevents data truncation.

2. **`src/codegen/expressions.ts`** — In `compileArrayDestructuringAssignment` rest element handling, when a rest local was pre-allocated as `externref` (e.g. `var y;` without type), allocate a fresh local with the correct vec type. Cannot change type in-place because earlier `__get_undefined()` initialization targets externref.

3. **`src/codegen/index.ts`** — In `destructureParamArray`, same fix for function parameter rest elements: when `ensureBindingLocals` pre-allocated with a different vec type than the code path produces, reallocate.

### Pre-existing Failures (not regressions)

The following equivalence test failures are pre-existing on main and NOT caused by sprint 38:
- `destructuring-extended > destructured function parameters with defaults` (default param evaluation)
- `for-of-array-destructuring > tuple array` (pre-existing)
- `default-parameters` (3 tests, pre-existing)
- `computed-property-names > number-to-string` (pre-existing)
- async/generator/arrow-call-apply tests (all pre-existing)
