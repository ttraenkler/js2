# #1553e — Array literal `[undefined]` must let destructuring default fire for f64 elements

Orthogonal to the helper-consolidation slices (#1553a-d). This is a
codegen bug in array-literal compilation that affects all destructure
modes (param, catch, decl) equally.

## Root cause

When the source array literal contains an explicit `undefined` and
type inference resolves the element to `f64` (the common case in
this compiler — anonymous numeric arrays), the `undefined` literal
gets emitted as `f64.const NaN` (or `f64.const 0`), which is *not*
the sNaN sentinel `0x7FF00000DEADC0DE` that `emitDefaultValueCheck`
matches.

Result: `let [x = 42] = [undefined]` produces `x = NaN` (or `x = 0`)
instead of firing the default and producing `x = 42`.

This is the same sentinel mechanism #866 introduced for missing
function-parameter defaults. We need to extend it to:

1. Out-of-bounds array reads (already done — `defaultValueInstrs`
   emits the sentinel).
2. **Explicit `undefined` literals in array initializers** (this issue).
3. **Explicit `undefined` literals in object initializers** for f64
   fields (related — verify behaviour, possibly a follow-up).

## Failure patterns

From the investigation §Reproductions:

| Probe | Source | Pre-fix result | Post-fix expected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `let [x = bump()] = [undefined as any]` (vec f64) | array literal | `x = NaN`, default skipped | default fires, `x = 42` |
| `let [, x = 9] = [1, undefined]` (vec f64) | array literal | `x = NaN` | `x = 9` |
| `function f([x = 7]) { return x } f([undefined])` (param) | param destructure | likely same bug | `x = 7` |

test262 patterns expected to flip:

- `ary-ptrn-elem-id-init-skipped.js` (let/const/var variants).
- `ary-ptrn-elem-id-init-fn-name-fn.js` (combined with #1450).
- Selected `for-of/dstr/ary-ptrn-elem-id-init-*.js`.

Estimated direct unlock: **~8-12** cases.

## Changes

### File: `src/codegen/literals.ts` (verified 2026-05-21)

The functions that build vec/tuple arrays from
`ts.ArrayLiteralExpression` live in `src/codegen/literals.ts`:
- `compileTupleLiteral` at line 1506
- `compileArrayLiteral` at line 1868
- `compileArrayConstructorCall` at line 2168

Patch both `compileTupleLiteral` and `compileArrayLiteral` for the
explicit-undefined element path.

For each element:

```ts
if (
  ts.isIdentifier(element) &&
  element.text === "undefined" &&
  /* not shadowed in scope */
) {
  if (elemType.kind === "f64") {
    // Emit sNaN sentinel so destructuring default fires (#1553e)
    fctx.body.push({ op: "i64.const", value: 0x7ff00000deadc0den } as unknown as Instr);
    fctx.body.push({ op: "f64.reinterpret_i64" } as unknown as Instr);
    continue;
  }
  if (elemType.kind === "externref") {
    // Emit JS undefined (already handled — verify)
    const undefIdx = ensureGetUndefined(ctx);
    if (undefIdx !== undefined) {
      fctx.body.push({ op: "call", funcIdx: undefIdx });
      continue;
    }
  }
}
```

Use the same sentinel emit pattern as `defaultValueInstrs` in
`src/codegen/type-coercion.ts` (callers visible at lines 511, 753;
verified 2026-05-21 — exact function line shifted from original 2266
reference; grep for `^export function defaultValueInstrs` to locate
current definition).

**Important — undefined identifier resolution**: only emit the
sentinel when the `undefined` identifier resolves to the global
`undefined` (i.e. is not shadowed by a local). Use
`ctx.checker.getSymbolAtLocation(element)` and verify the symbol is
the global `undefined` (or has no local declaration). For
`void 0` literal — also treat as undefined. **Implementation hint**:
factor out an `isUndefinedExpression(ctx, node): boolean` helper if
one doesn't already exist (grep first — there's likely one near the
existing `isNullOrUndefinedLiteral` in `destructuring-params.ts:170`).

### File: `src/codegen/destructuring-params.ts` (verify only)

Verified 2026-05-21: `isNullOrUndefinedLiteral(expr: ts.Expression): boolean`
exists at line 170. Use it as a model.

## Wasm IR pattern

For `[1, undefined, 3]` when inferred as `vec_f64`:

```wasm
;; alloc array of 3 f64
i32.const 3
array.new_default $arr_f64
local.tee $arr_tmp

;; elem 0 = 1
i32.const 0
f64.const 1
array.set $arr_f64

;; elem 1 = sNaN sentinel (explicit undefined)
local.get $arr_tmp
i32.const 1
i64.const 0x7ff00000deadc0de
f64.reinterpret_i64
array.set $arr_f64

;; elem 2 = 3
local.get $arr_tmp
i32.const 2
f64.const 3
array.set $arr_f64

;; len
i32.const 3
local.get $arr_tmp
struct.new $vec_f64
```

## Edge cases

1. **`void 0` and `(undefined)`** — both must produce the sentinel.
   Use a shared `isUndefinedExpression` helper.

2. **User-defined local `let undefined = 5; arr = [undefined]`** —
   must NOT produce the sentinel; emit the user's local value. This
   is why symbol resolution matters.

3. **`{a: undefined}` object literal with f64 field type** — same
   sentinel logic applies. Consider as **follow-up**: do not fix in
   this slice unless trivial (different code path:
   `compileObjectLiteralExpression`).

4. **Vec_externref array** — `[undefined as externref]` already maps
   to `__get_undefined()`. No change.

5. **i32 element type** — i32 has no reliable sentinel (already
   noted in `emitDefaultValueCheck`). Skip — `i32` defaults already
   never fire. Document as known limitation; track separately if a
   test surfaces.

6. **`[, ]` (elision)** — elision is **not** explicit-undefined per
   spec (`§13.2.4.1 ArrayAccumulation`). Out-of-bounds reads use the
   sentinel already. Make sure your detection treats elision (empty
   element slot) the same as OOB, not as explicit undefined. (In TS
   AST, elision is `ts.OmittedExpression`, which is not an
   `Identifier` — so the gate naturally skips it.)

## Test files

- `tests/issue-1553e.test.ts` — new focused regressions:
  - `[undefined, undefined]` with array destructuring + defaults.
  - `[1, undefined, 3][1]` direct index access must produce
    sentinel-compatible value (or, if we keep direct-index reads
    returning sentinel as well, document that NaN-the-sentinel and
    NaN-the-value alias).

## Regression gate

- Required: `net_per_test > 0`, no bucket grows > 5.
- Watch: any test that does `arr[i] === undefined` on a numeric
  array — the sentinel would now compare as `NaN`, which is
  `=== undefined`-false (already false today, but verify). The sNaN
  bit pattern flushes to a quiet NaN in arithmetic — confirm
  `arr[i] + 0 === NaN` (it is, both pre- and post-fix).

## Estimated change size

~30 LOC in `array-literal.ts`, plus optional ~15 LOC for the
shared `isUndefinedExpression` helper if one doesn't exist. Plus
~50 LOC of focused regression test.

## Risk

Low-medium. Sentinel values may **leak** into user-observable code if
the user writes `arr[0]` and then compares to a specific NaN bit
pattern — but no realistic JS code does that, and the sentinel is
indistinguishable from a quiet NaN under all standard JS operations
(`===`, `Number.isNaN`, arithmetic).

The one observable place is `Number.isNaN(arr[0])` which returns true
both pre- and post-fix. ✅ Safe.

## Out of scope

- Helper consolidation → #1553a-d.
- Object-literal explicit-undefined → follow-up.
- i32 sentinel mechanism → infeasible (no reliable sentinel).
- NamedEvaluation → #1450.

## Why this is independent of #1553a-d

The bug is in *value production* (how `[undefined]` lowers to
Wasm), not in *destructuring*. Fixing the helper does nothing for
this case because the helper's default check is correct — it just
never observes the sentinel because the array literal emits a
non-sentinel value. Hence orthogonal; can land in parallel.
