# #1124 -- Audit current codegen IR and, if needed, define a minimal SSA middle-end

## Status: done

## Outcome

The current compiler does **not** already have a usable compiler middle-end IR.
It has a typed-frontend plus a Wasm-oriented backend IR:

- TypeScript checker data is queried directly during AST lowering
- lowering emits `WasmModule` / `Instr[]` in `src/ir/types.ts`
- backend repair passes then patch Wasm validation and representation details

That backend IR is valuable and should stay the backend IR, but it is too late,
too stack-oriented, and too Wasm-shaped to serve as the place for SSA-style
analysis, call-graph-driven type propagation, or clean specialization.

**Explicit recommendation: insert new middle-end IR.**

Keep:

- TypeScript checker as the source of declared/inferred surface types
- current `WasmModule` IR as the backend IR
- current emitters/fixups/registries as the backend pipeline

Insert:

- a small JavaScript/TypeScript-aware SSA IR between checker analysis and Wasm
  IR construction

## Added goal

The new middle-end should make it possible to infer useful parameter and return
types for small unannotated JavaScript functions even when TypeScript itself
does not infer them from callers.

Concrete target case:

```js
function fib(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}

/** @param {number} n @returns {number} */
export function run(n) {
  return fib(n);
}
```

For cases like this, the compiler goal is:

- use TypeScript as the source of initial facts, not as the final authority on
  interprocedural inference
- infer that `fib` is on a numeric recursive path even though TS reports its
  parameter as implicit `any`
- propagate the exported `run(number) -> number` boundary fact into the
  recursive SCC containing `fib`
- keep that inference in the middle-end, not in ad hoc backend coercion logic

This should be treated as a first-class motivation for the SSA/type-propagation
layer, not just as a later optimization detail.

## Pipeline audit

### Current pipeline

```text
TS/JS source
  -> TypeScript parser/checker
  -> AST walkers in src/codegen/**
  -> direct emission of WasmModule / Instr[]
  -> backend fixups and stack repair
  -> WAT / binary / object emitters
```

### Concrete file map

- `src/compiler.ts`
  - Step 2 says "Generate IR", but calls `generateModule(...)` directly
- `src/codegen/index.ts`
  - builds `WasmModule` directly
  - mixes declaration collection, type queries, lowering, closure construction,
    import registration, and backend fixups
- `src/ir/types.ts`
  - defines Wasm-facing module/function/instruction structures
- `src/checker/type-mapper.ts`
  - collapses TS types early into backend `ValType`
- `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`
  - resolves call signatures on the fly and emits direct/backend call forms
- `src/codegen/closures.ts`
  - makes closure capture layout decisions during backend lowering
- `src/codegen/stack-balance.ts`
  - repairs structured-stack mismatches after emission
- `src/emit/wat.ts`, `src/emit/binary.ts`, `src/emit/object.ts`
  - consume the backend Wasm IR

## Audit answers

### 1. Is the current IR already a meaningful middle-end?

No. It is a backend IR for Wasm emission.

Evidence:

- `src/ir/types.ts` is built around Wasm module sections, locals, block types,
  and Wasm instructions, not source-language values or CFG nodes
- `src/codegen/index.ts` and `src/codegen/expressions/*.ts` emit stack machine
  instructions directly while still consulting the TS checker
- `src/codegen/stack-balance.ts` exists because correctness is being repaired
  after backend emission rather than expressed in a stable analysis IR

### 2. Is the current IR in SSA form?

No.

- values are implicit on the Wasm operand stack
- mutable state is represented with `local.set`, `local.tee`, `global.set`
- control-flow joins use structured Wasm block result typing, not block
  arguments or explicit phi-equivalents

### 3. Can it be evolved into the desired shape without a new layer?

Not cleanly. Extending `Instr` until it carries SSA facts would fight the
existing backend role of the IR and entangle frontend semantics with Wasm
validation details.

### 4. Where do values get typed today?

Mostly in three places:

- TypeScript checker queries such as `checker.getTypeAtLocation(...)` and
  `checker.getResolvedSignature(...)` across `src/codegen/**`
- `src/checker/type-mapper.ts::mapTsTypeToWasm(...)`
- ad hoc lowering-time coercion via `coerceType(...)` and backend helpers

These types are not stable analysis facts. They are consulted opportunistically
while emitting Wasm.

### 5. Where would call-site metadata naturally live today?

Nowhere durable. The current pipeline can inspect a call while compiling a
single AST node, but after lowering only backend `call`, `call_ref`, or
`call_indirect` remain. The call-site identity and argument facts are lost.

### 6. Can the current pipeline support interprocedural type propagation?

Not as a principled compiler stage. It can special-case some patterns, but it
collapses information too early into Wasm locals, refs, and coercions.

### 7. Should the current Wasm IR be replaced?

No. It is still the right backend IR.

### 8. Where do boxing/unboxing decisions happen now?

Mostly during Wasm lowering:

- `mapTsTypeToWasm(...)` collapses many source distinctions into `f64`, `i32`,
  `externref`, or broad ref kinds
- `coerceType(...)` and call/operand helpers insert conversions while emitting
- runtime imports such as `__box_number` / `__unbox_number` are pulled in from
  backend-oriented code paths

That is too late for clean analysis and too early for preserving specialized
paths cleanly.

### 9. Where would monomorphization fit today?

There is no good dedicated slot today. Doing it directly in AST-to-Wasm
lowering would further overload codegen. It belongs after SSA construction and
basic propagation, before Wasm lowering.

### 10. Where should `fib-recursive.js` numeric inference live?

Combination:

- initial facts can still come from the TS checker
- the actual recursive numeric fast-path inference should live in the new SSA
  middle-end
- specialization decisions should also live there
- backend Wasm lowering should only materialize the already-decided unboxed
  numeric path
- one explicit goal is to infer `fib(n: number) -> number` in cases where TS
  leaves `fib` as implicit `any`, using exported boundary facts plus recursive
  body constraints

## Concrete blockers

### Blocker 1: the IR is stack-based and mutable, not SSA

`src/ir/types.ts` models Wasm instructions such as `local.set`, `local.tee`,
`block`, `loop`, `if`, `call`, `call_ref`, and explicit Wasm `ValType`s. That
is appropriate for backend emission, but it gives no explicit SSA values or CFG
join arguments to analyze.

### Blocker 2: type information collapses too early

`src/checker/type-mapper.ts` maps many distinct TS facts to broad backend
categories, especially `externref`. Union collapse and object fallback happen
before there is a durable program representation where later passes could keep
refined facts alive.

### Blocker 3: call-site facts are transient

`src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` can inspect `getResolvedSignature(...)`,
argument nodes, and closure metadata while compiling one expression, but the
result becomes plain backend calls. There is no persistent `site_id`, edge
record, or call-graph layer.

### Blocker 4: closure capture semantics are decided during backend lowering

`src/codegen/closures.ts` computes captures, boxes mutable captures, and builds
closure wrapper structs directly in the Wasm backend. Captures do become
explicit in the emitted closure layout, but only after semantic analysis has
already been fused with backend lowering.

### Blocker 5: backend repair passes are compensating for missing middle-end structure

`src/codegen/stack-balance.ts` simulates stack effects and patches mismatches
after emission. That is a strong signal that the current IR is already in the
"make Wasm validate" phase, not the "analyze and transform source semantics"
phase.

## Things worth preserving

### Preserve 1: current Wasm IR as backend IR

`src/ir/types.ts` is already a useful backend contract for:

- `src/emit/wat.ts`
- `src/emit/binary.ts`
- `src/emit/object.ts`

It should remain the handoff format into emission.

### Preserve 2: current frontend collection and backend registries

The current codegen has real value in:

- import/type registries
- class/object layout knowledge
- closure wrapper generation
- string/native/external interop lowering

Those pieces should become consumers of the new middle-end or helpers during
SSA-to-Wasm lowering, not be rewritten blindly.

### Preserve 3: TypeScript checker integration

The compiler already has a strong source of declared and inferred facts via
`getTypeAtLocation(...)`, `getResolvedSignature(...)`, and return/parameter
queries. The new middle-end should consume those facts systematically rather
than replacing them.

## Recommendation

**Insert a new SSA middle-end IR between TypeScript checker analysis and the
current Wasm IR.**

Why `insert`, not `replace`:

- replacing the current Wasm IR would throw away working backend machinery
- extending the current Wasm IR would mix frontend semantics and backend
  validation concerns even more tightly
- an inserted layer lets migration be incremental and feature-gated

## Proposed minimal SSA IR

### Design goals

- block-argument SSA, not phi nodes
- explicit values and explicit operands
- explicit call sites
- explicit closure captures
- types rich enough for propagation but smaller than full TS types
- clean boundary where boxing/unboxing becomes explicit

### TypeScript data structures

```ts
export type IrType =
  | { kind: "unknown" }
  | { kind: "never" }
  | { kind: "bool" }
  | { kind: "i32" }
  | { kind: "f64" }
  | { kind: "i64" }
  | { kind: "string" }
  | { kind: "object"; shapeId?: string }
  | { kind: "function"; functionId?: string }
  | { kind: "closure"; functionId?: string }
  | { kind: "boxed"; inner: IrType }
  | { kind: "union"; members: IrType[] }
  | { kind: "dynamic" };

export interface IrModule {
  functions: IrFunction[];
}

export interface IrFunction {
  id: string;
  exportName?: string;
  params: IrBlockArg[];
  returnType: IrType;
  blocks: IrBlock[];
  sourceName?: string;
}

export interface IrBlock {
  id: string;
  args: IrBlockArg[];
  instructions: IrInstruction[];
  terminator: IrTerminator;
}

export interface IrBlockArg {
  id: string;
  type: IrType;
  sourceName?: string;
}

export interface IrValue {
  id: string;
  type: IrType;
}

export interface IrCallTarget {
  kind: "direct" | "indirect";
  functionId?: string;
  callee: IrValue;
}

export interface IrCallSiteMeta {
  siteId: string;
  tsSignatureText?: string;
  inferredArgTypes: IrType[];
  inferredReturnType: IrType;
}

export type IrInstruction =
  | { kind: "const"; out: IrValue; value: number | bigint | boolean | string | null }
  | { kind: "prim"; out: IrValue; op: "add" | "sub" | "mul" | "div" | "eq" | "lte"; args: IrValue[] }
  | { kind: "get_prop"; out: IrValue; object: IrValue; key: string | IrValue }
  | { kind: "set_prop"; object: IrValue; key: string | IrValue; value: IrValue }
  | { kind: "call"; out?: IrValue; target: IrCallTarget; args: IrValue[]; meta: IrCallSiteMeta }
  | { kind: "closure"; out: IrValue; functionId: string; captures: IrValue[] }
  | { kind: "box"; out: IrValue; value: IrValue; targetType: IrType }
  | { kind: "unbox"; out: IrValue; value: IrValue; targetType: IrType };

export type IrTerminator =
  | { kind: "branch"; target: string; args: IrValue[] }
  | { kind: "cond_branch"; condition: IrValue; thenBlock: string; thenArgs: IrValue[]; elseBlock: string; elseArgs: IrValue[] }
  | { kind: "return"; value?: IrValue };
```

### Why block arguments

Block arguments make control-flow merges explicit without introducing a
separate phi node form. That maps cleanly both to Wasm structured blocks and to
future MLIR-style lowering.

## Call-site-aware call representation

Each call instruction carries:

- `siteId`
- direct vs indirect target kind
- resolved `functionId` when statically known
- inferred argument types
- inferred return type

Representation:

```ts
{
  kind: "call",
  out: v3,
  target: { kind: "direct", functionId: "fib", callee: v1 },
  args: [v2],
  meta: {
    siteId: "fib:entry:call0",
    inferredArgTypes: [{ kind: "f64" }],
    inferredReturnType: { kind: "f64" }
  }
}
```

This is the right place for:

- devirtualization candidates
- monomorphization decisions
- context-insensitive call graph edges
- future call-site-sensitive cloning if needed

## Call graph

Build it directly from SSA IR:

- nodes = `IrFunction.id`
- edges = `call.meta.siteId`

Each edge carries:

- caller id
- callee id if known
- direct/indirect kind
- argument types
- inferred return type

Example:

```ts
interface CallGraphEdge {
  siteId: string;
  callerId: string;
  calleeId?: string;
  kind: "direct" | "indirect";
  argTypes: IrType[];
  returnType: IrType;
}
```

## Basic type propagation

Start with a small context-insensitive constraint system:

1. Seed parameter and local facts from the TS checker when available.
2. Seed constant ops with exact primitive categories.
3. Propagate primitive op requirements.
   `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `lte` constrain operands/results toward numeric types.
4. For direct calls, flow call argument facts into callee params.
5. Flow callee return facts back into call results.
6. Merge at block arguments using conservative unions.
7. For indirect calls, use `dynamic` unless closure/callee identity is known.

This is enough to support the first useful case:

- recursive numeric kernels like `fib-recursive.js`
- unannotated helper functions whose numeric type must be inferred from
  exported typed callers plus body constraints

without forcing a full optimizer framework immediately.

## Closure representation

Closures should be explicit before Wasm lowering:

- closure instruction references the lifted function id
- capture list is explicit SSA values

Example:

```ts
v4 = closure @adder_impl captures [v1, v2]
```

That keeps semantic capture structure available for:

- call-graph construction
- capture boxing decisions
- closure wrapper specialization

instead of discovering it only while building backend structs.

## Boxing and unboxing

### Current state

Today boxing/unboxing is largely a backend-lowering concern, which pollutes fast
paths with generic value plumbing.

### New rule

In the new IR, boxing and unboxing should be explicit operations, but inserted
late by a boundary-lowering pass:

- keep core SSA instructions typed in their preferred specialized form
- insert `box` / `unbox` only where dynamic boundaries require it
- lower `box` / `unbox` to current runtime/import mechanisms during SSA-to-Wasm

### Why this matters for `fib-recursive.js`

`fib` should remain:

- `f64` or `i32` parameters/results through the recursive SCC
- direct calls on specialized values
- no generic `externref` round-trips inside the recursive kernel

Only the external/export boundary should need boxing if the public ABI demands
it.

## Monomorphization

### Where it fits

As an IR transform after initial SSA construction and basic propagation, before
SSA-to-Wasm lowering.

### What gets monomorphized first

- function signatures for direct-call strongly typed kernels
- closure wrapper signatures where captures and call arity are known

Not first target:

- object/container shapes
- broad context-sensitive cloning

### Why here

At that point the compiler knows:

- the call graph
- propagated param/return facts
- dynamic vs direct call boundaries

but has not yet committed to backend locals, refs, and coercion code.

## Example IR snippets

### Simple function

Source:

```ts
function add1(x) { return x + 1; }
```

IR:

```text
func @add1(%x: f64) -> f64
entry():
  %c1 = const 1 : f64
  %r = prim add(%x, %c1) : f64
  return %r
```

### Property access

Source:

```ts
return obj.x;
```

IR:

```text
%v = get_prop %obj, "x" : dynamic
return %v
```

### Function call

Source:

```ts
return fib(n - 1);
```

IR:

```text
%c1 = const 1 : f64
%n1 = prim sub(%n, %c1) : f64
%r = call_direct @fib(%n1) [site_id=fib:call0] : f64
return %r
```

### Closure

Source:

```ts
function outer(a) { return (b) => a + b; }
```

IR:

```text
func @outer(%a: f64) -> closure
entry():
  %cl = closure @outer_lambda_0 captures [%a]
  return %cl

func @outer_lambda_0(%env_a: f64, %b: f64) -> f64
entry():
  %r = prim add(%env_a, %b) : f64
  return %r
```

## Worked example: `fib-recursive.js`

Source:

```ts
function fib(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```

### Desired IR

```text
func @fib(%n: f64) -> f64
entry():
  %c1 = const 1 : f64
  %cond = prim lte(%n, %c1) : bool
  cond_branch %cond then bb_ret(%n) else bb_rec(%n)

bb_ret(%v: f64):
  return %v

bb_rec(%n0: f64):
  %c1a = const 1 : f64
  %n1 = prim sub(%n0, %c1a) : f64
  %r1 = call_direct @fib(%n1) [site_id=fib:rec1] : f64
  %c2 = const 2 : f64
  %n2 = prim sub(%n0, %c2) : f64
  %r2 = call_direct @fib(%n2) [site_id=fib:rec2] : f64
  %sum = prim add(%r1, %r2) : f64
  return %sum
```

### Why this solves #1121 conceptually

The recursive SCC exposes a stable numeric constraint cycle:

- `lte`, `sub`, and `add` require numeric operands/results
- direct recursive calls preserve the parameter/return relation
- the exported `run` function can simply forward `f64` into `fib`

That inference belongs in the middle-end, not in late backend coercion.

It also directly addresses the specific gap that TypeScript does not infer here:

- TS can leave `fib`'s parameter as implicit `any`
- the middle-end should still infer `fib(number) -> number`
- that inferred fact should then drive backend selection of the clean numeric
  path

## Lowering pseudocode

```text
buildIrFunction(tsFunction):
  create IrFunction
  create entry block
  map TS params -> block args using checker seeds
  lower body statements into SSA blocks

lowerExpression(node):
  switch node.kind
    NumericLiteral:
      return const(f64, value)
    Identifier:
      return current binding value
    BinaryExpression(+,-,*,<=,...):
      lhs = lowerExpression(node.left)
      rhs = lowerExpression(node.right)
      infer primitive op constraints
      return prim(op, lhs, rhs)
    PropertyAccessExpression:
      obj = lowerExpression(node.expression)
      return get_prop(obj, node.name.text)
    CallExpression:
      callee = lowerExpression(node.expression)
      args = lowerArguments(node.arguments)
      sig = checker.getResolvedSignature(node)
      target = direct if statically known else indirect
      return call(target, args, site metadata from checker)
    ArrowFunction / FunctionExpression:
      lifted = lower nested function separately
      captures = collect referenced outer values
      return closure(lifted, captures)

runMiddleEnd(module):
  construct call graph
  run context-insensitive propagation to fixpoint
  optionally monomorphize direct-call hot/safe candidates
  insert explicit box/unbox only at dynamic boundaries
  lower SSA blocks/instructions to WasmModule backend IR
```

## Migration guidance

### Entry point

Insert a new stage in `src/compiler.ts` between checker analysis and
`generateModule(...)`:

```text
TypedAST -> buildSsaModule(ast) -> runMiddleEndPasses(ssa) -> lowerToWasm(ssa)
```

### Exit point

The new layer should lower into the existing `WasmModule` structures from
`src/ir/types.ts`.

### Incremental rollout

Use a flag-gated rollout:

1. Introduce SSA IR data structures and builders for a small subset:
   numeric expressions, direct calls, returns, `if`
2. Lower that subset to current Wasm IR
3. Use it first for small function bodies and numeric kernels
4. Keep the existing AST-to-Wasm path as fallback for unsupported features
5. Expand feature coverage gradually

### First practical target

Make the first supported slice cover:

- direct functions
- numeric arithmetic/comparisons
- direct recursion
- simple exported wrappers

That is enough to attack `fib-recursive.js` cleanly.

## Short design decisions

### Why not reuse Wasm `Instr` as the middle-end?

Because it is already committed to:

- stack machine sequencing
- Wasm block typing
- Wasm locals/globals
- runtime/import lowering details

### Why keep the backend IR?

Because it already works as the contract for emitters and many backend helpers.

### Why start context-insensitive?

Because it is enough for the first benchmark-driven wins and keeps the design
small. The call-site metadata still leaves room for later context-sensitive
specialization.

## Acceptance summary

This audit concludes:

- the current compiler does **not** already have a meaningful middle-end IR
- the current IR is **not** SSA
- the current Wasm IR should **remain** the backend IR
- the correct architectural move is to **insert** a minimal SSA middle-end

That gives the cleanest place for:

- call graphs
- basic type propagation
- recursive numeric inference
- controlled monomorphization
- explicit boxing/unboxing boundaries

without discarding the current backend machinery.

## Current State Analysis (no-IR)

_Added 2026-04-19. Grounded in the source as it stands today. Complements the
earlier audit by answering three questions concretely: what works without an
IR, what is structurally limiting right now, and where the ceiling is._

### Pipeline snapshot

`src/compiler.ts` -> `src/codegen/index.ts::generateModule` (lines 194–385)
runs a single long orchestration that interleaves:

1. Declaration collection passes (`collectExternDeclarations`,
   `collectAllSourceImports`, `collectDeclarations`,
   `applyShapeInference` — `src/codegen/index.ts:213–267`)
2. AST-walk codegen that directly builds `WasmModule`/`Instr[]`
   (`compileDeclarations`, `src/codegen/declarations.ts`)
3. Ten post-hoc repair passes over the finished `WasmModule`
   (`src/codegen/index.ts:269–379`): `fixupStructNewArgCounts`,
   `fixupStructNewResultCoercion`, `buildShapePropFlagsTable`,
   `collectDeclaredFuncRefs`, `markLeafStructsFinal`, `eliminateDeadImports`,
   `repairStructTypeMismatches`, `peepholeOptimize`, `stackBalance`,
   `fixupExternConvertAny`.

The total "emit then patch" surface is substantial:

| Pass | File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| `stackBalance` | `src/codegen/stack-balance.ts` | 2,512 | fix stack-shape mismatches across `if`/`try`/`block` branches |
| `fixups.ts` (struct/extern repair) | `src/codegen/fixups.ts` | 986 | rewrite emitted `struct.get`/`struct.set` when `externref` was used in place of a struct ref; fix `extern.convert_any` applied to wrong types |
| `peephole.ts` | `src/codegen/peephole.ts` | 213 | remove redundant `ref.as_non_null`, `local.tee;drop`, increment dead-store, etc. |
| `dead-elimination.ts` | `src/codegen/dead-elimination.ts` | 420 | strip speculatively registered imports/types |

These passes exist because the direct AST -> Wasm emitter cannot reason about
value flow before it has already written the instruction stream.

### What Works (without an IR)

- **Test262 honest baseline: 22,449 pass / 43,169 total ≈ 52.0%** (run
  `068186ad`, `benchmarks/results/runs/index.json`; the two most recent
  entries at `bf84cab3` show a regression to 7 pass that is unrelated to the
  architecture — a broken build/runtime).
- Feature coverage that the single-pass emitter handles well, verifiable from
  the source tree:
  - Arithmetic, comparisons, boolean logic (`src/codegen/binary-ops.ts`,
    `expressions/unary.ts`)
  - Closures with ref-cell-boxed mutable captures
    (`src/codegen/closures.ts`; ref cell pattern in
    `getOrRegisterRefCellType`)
  - Classes, inheritance, `super`, getters/setters, static members
    (`src/codegen/class-bodies.ts`, `new-super.ts`)
  - Destructuring (pattern + default + rest)
    (`src/codegen/statements/destructuring.ts` — 1,995 lines)
  - Generators (`function*`) and async functions
    (`src/codegen/statements/control-flow.ts`,
    `src/codegen/expressions/misc.ts` — yield expression)
  - `for-of`, `for-in`, labeled break/continue, try/catch/finally
    (`src/codegen/statements/loops.ts` — 2,815 lines;
    `statements/exceptions.ts`)
  - Tail calls for direct recursion via `return_call` (CLAUDE.md key
    pattern; emitted in `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`)
  - TypedArray / DataView / ArrayBuffer, `delete` operator, native strings
    (`src/codegen/native-strings.ts`, `typeof-delete.ts`)
  - TDZ for module-level `let`/`const`
    (`src/codegen/statements/tdz.ts`)
  - Exceptions exported via a module exception tag
    (`src/codegen/index.ts:352`)
- The thing that works well structurally: **a node-local, type-directed
  emitter**. When the TS checker has a concrete type at the node and the
  operation has a direct Wasm opcode, emission is short, readable, and
  correct. Pure typed TypeScript (not test262) looks roughly like a
  straightforward transliteration.

### What Is Limiting (no-IR pain points already in the code)

These are structural, not style. Each exists because there is nowhere in the
pipeline to hold "analyzed program facts" between phases.

1. **`addUnionImports` late-import index shifting**
   (`src/codegen/expressions/late-imports.ts:20–100+`). When a coercion or
   property-access decision during expression lowering needs a new import,
   the import is added *mid-compilation*. Because the backend IR stores raw
   function indices (`funcIdx: number`), every already-emitted
   `call`/`ref.func` in the module — plus the current function's body, every
   entry on `fctx.savedBodies`, every parent on `ctx.funcStack`, every
   `parentBodiesStack` entry, and the pending init body — must be walked and
   rewritten. Call sites: 36+ across `type-coercion.ts`,
   `property-access.ts`, `object-ops.ts`, `binary-ops.ts`. With symbolic
   function references in an IR, this function would not exist.

2. **`savedBody` swap pattern** (40+ occurrences in `closures.ts`,
   `class-bodies.ts`, `function-body.ts`, `string-ops.ts`,
   `expressions/misc.ts`). To compile "an expression into a separate buffer
   and then splice it back", the codegen temporarily reassigns
   `fctx.body = newBody`, emits, then restores. This compensates for the
   fact that emission is a linear stream rather than a tree of values.
   `type-coercion.ts:627` explicitly documents avoiding the swap "which
   would break addUnionImports index shifting" — the two workarounds
   interact.

3. **`stack-balance.ts` (2,512 lines)** exists to repair
   `if`/`else`/`try`/`block` arms whose branches produce mismatched stack
   states. The header (`src/codegen/stack-balance.ts:1–27`) names three
   whole classes of mismatch (extra pushes, missing pushes, wrong type in
   fallthrough) that the emitter routinely produces and must retroactively
   fix. An IR with explicit block arguments or explicit values could not
   emit these mismatches in the first place.

4. **`repairStructTypeMismatches`** (`src/codegen/fixups.ts:65–`). Scans
   emitted `struct.get`/`struct.set` and rewrites the prior instruction
   when it pushed `externref` instead of the required struct ref, splicing
   in `any.convert_extern` + `ref.cast`. This is the direct consequence of
   `checker/type-mapper.ts::mapTsTypeToWasm` collapsing most object types
   to `externref` (`src/checker/type-mapper.ts:84–89`) before any
   per-function refinement is possible.

5. **`fixupExternConvertAny`** repairs invalid `extern.convert_any` already
   in the module (`src/codegen/index.ts:377`). Same root cause — the
   coercion logic optimistically inserts conversions during emission and
   another pass cleans up the ones that turned out wrong.

6. **Placeholder functions in the declaration pass**
   (`src/codegen/declarations.ts:1834`: "Create placeholder function to be
   filled in second pass"). Two-pass declaration collection works, but
   every participating pass has to know that function bodies are not yet
   compiled and must look up types out-of-band. An IR would hold
   declared-but-not-lowered functions as first-class nodes.

7. **Ad-hoc flow analysis lives in `FunctionContext`**
   (`src/codegen/context/types.ts:94–185`). Fields that would belong on an
   SSA IR are smeared across one stateful record:
   `narrowedNonNull: Set<string>`, `safeIndexedArrays: Set<string>` (for
   for-loop bounds-check elision), `tdzFlagLocals: Map<string, number>`,
   `boxedCaptures: Map<…>`, `pendingCallbackWritebacks: Instr[]`,
   `persistentCallbackWritebacks: Instr[]`, `catchRethrowStack`,
   `finallyStack`, `savedBodies: Instr[][]`. Each entry is a one-off hack
   to plumb a flow fact that would be an IR property. Any new
   narrowing/flow feature adds another such field.

8. **`applyShapeInference` is a hand-rolled one-off pre-pass**
   (`src/codegen/index.ts:264`, `src/codegen/declarations.ts`). It
   overrides TS types for array-like variables by scanning usage. This is
   exactly the propagation pattern that #743, #684, #685 want to
   generalize, but there is nowhere to hang a general solver, so it is
   re-implemented per feature.

9. **Type collapse happens at the wrong layer.**
   `mapTsTypeToWasm` (`src/checker/type-mapper.ts:38–107`) decides early
   that unions, objects, `any`, `unknown`, and anything the codegen can't
   name become `externref`. Once collapsed, downstream passes cannot
   distinguish "genuine heterogeneous union" from "numeric-only union I
   could have unboxed" without re-asking the TS checker — which many
   backend call sites do (`ctx.checker.getTypeAtLocation(...)` is
   scattered through codegen).

10. **Call-site facts are transient.**
    `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` (6,558 lines) consults
    `checker.getResolvedSignature` while compiling a single call and then
    drops the information. There is no per-call-site record, no call-graph
    edge, and no way for a later pass to cluster calls for
    monomorphization. #743, #744, #746, #905, #1046, #1121, #1126 all
    depend on such a record existing.

### What Is Broken / The Ceiling

Ceiling evidence, grouped by category. Each bullet cites either an
existing issue or a concrete source pattern.

**Fundamentally blocked without a middle-end IR**

- **Whole-program type flow / interprocedural propagation** (#743
  critical, #685 ready, #684 ready). The `performance` goal
  (`plan/goals/performance.md:3`) states the compiler's speed thesis
  ("type flow analysis eliminates externref overhead, monomorphization
  specializes hot paths") but both capabilities are filed as hard/critical
  because there is nowhere to host the solver. Every numeric test262 test
  that goes through an untyped JS helper pays externref cost today.
- **Function monomorphization for polymorphic call sites** (#744, sprint
  42, ready). Requires per-call-site type records + call graph edges that
  the emitter does not build.
- **Tagged-union representation for `number | string`, `number | null`**
  (#745, high). Requires deciding union shape globally; today every such
  value is boxed to `externref` via `mapTsTypeToWasm:79–80`.
- **Escape analysis / stack allocation** (#747, blocked). Needs a flow
  graph — neither local nor interprocedural analysis exists.
- **Link-time specialization for separately-compiled modules** (#904
  high, #1046 ready). Needs stable call-site metadata across modules;
  today, calls become `call`/`call_ref`/`call_indirect` at module boundary
  and the edge is gone.
- **Inline property tables / versioned shapes** (#746 blocked, #905
  ready). Needs per-object-site shape facts surviving lowering.
- **Numeric recursive-kernel inference without JSDoc** (#1121, #1122,
  sprint 42). The original motivation of this issue (#1124). Direct
  recursion with implicit-`any` parameters cannot be proven numeric
  without a recursive SCC analysis on an IR.
- **Safe int32 lowering for bitwise-coerced numeric loops** (#1120, #1126,
  sprint 42). Needs range / bit-flow facts.

**Fundamentally hard without a middle-end IR, independent of performance**

- **`eval` with scope injection.** Not in the source; TypeScript strict
  mode (all modules) rejects the assignable `eval` patterns at the front
  end (`src/compiler/validation.ts:244–467` bars assignment to
  `eval`/`arguments`). A full `eval` implementation would need either a
  runtime scope object or recompilation, neither of which has a landing
  place in a stream-emitter.
- **`with` statement.** Skip-filtered in the test262 runner
  (`tests/test262-runner.ts:194–199`: _"ES5 legacy: with statement (strict
  mode disallowed)"_). Dynamic binding across blocks requires explicit
  scope modelling.
- **`Proxy` / `Reflect`.** Skip-filter at
  `tests/test262-runner.ts:1934` and the `eval`/meta-object families
  around it. Implementing traps needs a meta-object dispatch that only
  makes sense if calls are uniformly routable — which in turn needs an IR
  boundary.
- **`FinalizationRegistry` / `WeakRef`.** Skip-filtered with explicit
  issue reference (`tests/test262-runner.ts:215–233`, issue #988). Needs
  GC finalizer callbacks and a runtime scheduling story.
- **`SharedArrayBuffer`** (`tests/test262-runner.ts:209–214`, issue
  #674). Needs shared Wasm memory; orthogonal to IR, listed for
  completeness.
- **Deep flow-sensitive type narrowing.** The current implementation is
  `FunctionContext.narrowedNonNull: Set<string>` — a single bit per
  variable, reset on branch join. Anything more (narrowing a union to
  each arm of a `typeof`/`instanceof`, refining after a `throw`, keeping
  narrowing alive across a loop back-edge) requires a CFG the compiler
  does not have.

**Partially broken today because of the ceiling**

- **Closure capture types collapse to `externref`** whenever the TS
  checker cannot prove a single Wasm kind — see `mapTsTypeToWasm:84–89`.
  Fixed for specific cases by #686 (done) but each fix is a per-feature
  hack rather than a general solution.
- **Union dispatch via host imports.** Binary ops on heterogeneous unions
  currently route through JS host imports (`__any_add`, `__box_number`,
  `__unbox_number`) instead of dispatch-in-Wasm, because there is no
  tagged-union representation (#745).
- **No cross-function inlining beyond the per-call-site inline-small pass
  (#465).** `InlinableFunctionInfo`
  (`src/codegen/context/types.ts:70–79`) stores a shallow copy of a
  compiled body and splices it at call sites with matching parameter
  arity. This is mechanical, not profile- or type-guided.

**Estimated ceiling of the no-IR approach**

Speculative, but bounded by the structure:

- **Current: ~52% pass.** (22,449 / 43,169 on `068186ad`.)
- **Probable ceiling without an IR: ~60–65%.** More of the remaining CE
  is from closure/type-capture edge cases, deeper narrowing, and numeric
  inference failures that today degrade to `externref` and then fail at
  runtime. Each of those can be pushed a little further with per-feature
  hacks like `applyShapeInference` and `narrowedNonNull`, but the cost
  curve is super-linear because each new hack has to interact correctly
  with `addUnionImports`, `savedBody`, `stackBalance`, and
  `repairStructTypeMismatches`.
- **Truly out of reach without an IR (based on the skip filters and the
  performance backlog): `eval`, `with`, `Proxy`/`Reflect`, finalization,
  general monomorphization, escape analysis, link-time specialization.**
  These are not "hard to prioritize" — they are "no natural location in
  the pipeline".

### Bottom line

The current architecture is a typed front end with a Wasm-shaped backend
IR and ten repair passes stitching them together. It is at ~52% test262
and can probably be pushed into the low 60s by continuing the existing
pattern of per-feature hacks. The cost is that each new feature compounds
with the existing repair passes and state-ful `FunctionContext` fields,
so the marginal cost of the next fix is rising — visible in the size of
`stack-balance.ts` (2,512 lines), `fixups.ts` (986 lines),
`calls.ts` (6,558 lines), and `destructuring.ts` (1,995 lines).

Every issue on the `performance` goal that is marked `feasibility: hard`
(#743, #744, #745, #747, #904, #1121, #1126) names the same missing
piece: a place between the TypeScript checker and Wasm emission where
typed program facts can live, be queried, and be mutated by passes. That
is the middle-end IR the earlier section of this issue specifies. The
evidence here is that the current compiler has reached the point where
its repair-pass surface is itself a bottleneck, and further compounding
will continue to slow per-feature work.
