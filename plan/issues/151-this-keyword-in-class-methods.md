# #151 — `this` keyword in class methods for test262

## Problem
In strict mode (used for .ts files), TypeScript's `noImplicitThis` check
produces diagnostic 2683 ("'this' implicitly has type 'any'") for class methods.
While this was already downgraded to a warning in the compiler, the unnecessary
diagnostic noise could confuse error reporting. More importantly, the checker
would resolve `this` to type `any` instead of the class instance type.

## Fix
- Set `noImplicitThis: false` in `src/checker/index.ts` compiler options
- Our codegen already handles `this` correctly by mapping it to the struct self
  parameter via `fctx.localMap.set("this", selfLocal)` in `compileClassBodies`
- This eliminates the diagnostic entirely rather than just downgrading it

## Status: Done
