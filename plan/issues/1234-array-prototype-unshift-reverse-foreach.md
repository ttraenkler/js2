# #1234 — `Array.prototype.{unshift,reverse,forEach,…}` should iterate over defined properties for non-Array receivers

See `plan/issues/backlog/1234.md` for full problem description and implementation plan.

## Summary

Two genuine runtime-infinite-loop CTs in the post-#1227 baseline:
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/unshift/length-near-integer-limit.js`
- `test/built-ins/Array/prototype/reverse/length-exceeding-integer-limit-with-object.js`

Root cause: shims iterate `[0, length)` where `length ≈ 9e15`, but the receiver
has only a handful of defined properties. The spec requires `HasProperty` per
index — the getter at the high index throws on the first real check and unwinds.

Fix: for non-Array receivers, collect defined integer-keyed properties first
(`Object.keys(O).filter(isIntIndex).sort()`), then iterate only those — `O(defined)`
not `O(length)`.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Both target CT tests pass
2. `forEach/15.4.4.18-7-c-ii-1.js` completes in <50 ms
3. No regression in equivalence array tests
4. CI compile_timeout count drops by 2

## Implementation summary

Added sparse-aware fast paths in `src/runtime.ts` for the three methods
when invoked via `__proto_method_call` on a non-Array receiver **with a
huge `length`** (`> 2^20`). For normal-sized receivers V8 native runs as
before — the threshold prevents the fast path from regressing tests that
worked correctly under V8's spec walk.

- `_arrayProtoUnshiftSparse` — collects defined integer-keyed own props
  via `Reflect.ownKeys`, iterates only those from highest-key down,
  copying each value to `key + argCount` and deleting the source.
- `_arrayProtoReverseSparse` — pairs `(k, len-1-k)` walks for each
  defined key, swapping/moving values; breaks at the midpoint.
- `_arrayProtoForEachSparse` — iterates only defined keys ascending,
  invoking the callback with `(value, index, O)`.

All three paths use plain `O[key]` syntax for reads, so accessor `get`
trap throws (where the compiler preserves them) propagate naturally.
Real-Array receivers continue to use V8's native (which has its own
dense fast path).

### Acceptance criteria status

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Both target CT tests pass | **Partial** — both no longer hang; status flips from `compile_timeout` to `fail` because the unrelated object-literal-getter compile bug means `Get(O, "9e15")` returns 0 instead of throwing. The full pass needs that compiler bug fixed in a separate issue. |
| 2 | `forEach/15.4.4.18-7-c-ii-1.js` <50 ms | **Not addressed.** The 5.3 s outlier uses a different codegen path (`compileArrayLikePrototypeCall` in `src/codegen/array-methods.ts`) that inlines an `__extern_length` + `__extern_get_idx` loop in Wasm — bypasses the runtime fast paths added here. Fixing that is a separate codegen change; tracked as a follow-up. |
| 3 | No regression in equivalence array tests | **Confirmed.** `tests/array-methods.test.ts` has 2 pre-existing failures (`pop returns last element`, `shift returns first element`) that reproduce on `main` without these changes. All other array tests still pass. |
| 4 | CI compile_timeout count drops by 2 | **Met.** The two genuine-hang tests (`unshift/length-near-integer-limit.js`, `reverse/length-exceeding-integer-limit-with-object.js`) now finish in <2 ms in isolation. |

## Test Results

`npm test -- tests/issue-1234.test.ts` — 3/3 pass:
- `Array.prototype.unshift.call` on length=2^53 sparse object completes in <100 ms ✓
- `Array.prototype.reverse.call` on length=2^53 sparse object completes in <100 ms ✓
- Real Array receivers continue to use V8's native (sanity) ✓

Direct probe of the two CT target test262 files:
- `unshift/length-near-integer-limit.js` — 1 ms (was hanging at 30 s)
- `reverse/length-exceeding-integer-limit-with-object.js` — 0 ms (was hanging at 30 s)

`npx tsc --noEmit -p .` — clean.

## Follow-up issues to file

1. **Object-literal getter handling** — `var o = { get x() { throw } }` then `o.x` returns `0` (default) instead of throwing. Compiler emits the getter as a plain `i32` struct field, dropping the accessor body. Affects #1234's tests #1 (full pass) plus an unknown number of test262 cases. Not in scope here.
2. **`compileArrayLikePrototypeCall` sparse-aware path** — the inline-Wasm codegen for `Array.prototype.{forEach,every,some,find,…}.call(O, closure)` in `src/codegen/array-methods.ts` walks `[0, len)` directly via `__extern_length`, bypassing the runtime fast path. For receivers with `length > some-threshold`, should bail to `__proto_method_call` (slower but defined-property iteration). Closes the #1234 forEach honourable mention.
