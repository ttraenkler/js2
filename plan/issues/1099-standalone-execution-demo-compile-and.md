# #1099 — Standalone execution demo: zero-JS-host program on Wasmtime

## Source

External compiler engineer review (2026-04-12): "demonstrate a stronger standalone/non-JS-host execution story" — identified as a key milestone for production/infrastructure credibility.

## Problem

js2wasm has a `--target wasi` flag and a dual-mode architecture principle, but there is no end-to-end proof that a non-trivial TypeScript program compiles and runs on a standalone Wasm runtime (Wasmtime, Wasmer, or Wazero) with **zero JS host involvement**.

The existing pieces:
- `--target wasi` emits WASI imports (fd_write, proc_exit)
- `--nativeStrings` uses WasmGC i16 arrays instead of wasm:js-string
- #680 / #681 track pure Wasm generators and iterators (not yet implemented)
- #682 tracks standalone RegExp engine (not yet implemented)
- #1035 tracks a WASI hello-fs demo (not yet implemented)
- #1094 tracks shrinking runtime.ts host boundary

But no issue ties these into a concrete, demonstrable milestone with acceptance criteria.

## Goal

A TypeScript program that:
1. Takes input (WASI stdin or command-line args)
2. Performs non-trivial computation (string processing, array operations, control flow)
3. Produces output (WASI stdout)
4. Compiles via `npx js2wasm --target wasi --nativeStrings`
5. Runs on Wasmtime with correct output
6. Uses **zero JS host imports** — the import section contains only WASI interfaces

## Proposed demo program

```typescript
// standalone-demo.ts — FizzBuzz with string building
function fizzBuzz(n: number): string {
  const results: string[] = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 15 === 0) results.push("FizzBuzz");
    else if (i % 3 === 0) results.push("Fizz");
    else if (i % 5 === 0) results.push("Buzz");
    else results.push(String(i));
  }
  return results.join("\n");
}

console.log(fizzBuzz(100));
```

This exercises: number arithmetic, string operations, array push/join, conditionals, loops, function calls, console.log → WASI fd_write.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Demo program compiles with `--target wasi --nativeStrings` to a valid .wasm binary
- [ ] Binary's import section contains **only** WASI-preview-1 imports (no `env.*`, no `wasm:js-string`)
- [ ] `wasmtime run standalone-demo.wasm` produces correct FizzBuzz output to stdout
- [ ] Reproduction script in `scripts/standalone-demo.sh` (compile + run + diff expected output)
- [ ] CI job validates the standalone demo passes on each merge to main
- [ ] Documents which language features are supported in standalone mode vs. JS-host-only

## Blockers and dependencies

| Dependency | Status | Impact |
|------------|--------|--------|
| #1094 Shrink runtime.ts | Ready | Must identify which host imports the demo hits and compile them away |
| Console.log → WASI fd_write | Partially implemented (`--target wasi`) | Needs verification for string args |
| Native strings | Implemented (`--nativeStrings`) | Should work for simple string ops |
| Array push/join | Implemented | Needs verification without JS host |
| String() conversion | May need host import | Must compile away for standalone |

The demo is intentionally scoped to features that should *already* work in standalone mode. If compilation reveals missing standalone implementations, those become targeted sub-issues.

### Not needed for this demo (tracked separately for standalone mode)

These APIs need dedicated Wasm-native implementations, tracked in separate issues:

- **Proxy** — #1100
- **RegExp** — #682
- **WeakRef / FinalizationRegistry** — #1101
- **eval() / Function()** — #1102
- **Map / Set / WeakMap / WeakSet** — #1103
- **Error subclasses** — #1104 (demo uses console.log, not throw/catch)
- **String methods** beyond basic concat — #1105

The demo program is scoped to features that already work in standalone mode. These APIs are not permanent host dependencies — they all have Wasm-native implementation paths.

## What success proves

"js2wasm can compile TypeScript to a standalone Wasm binary that runs on industry-standard Wasm runtimes without any JavaScript runtime." This is the single strongest signal for infrastructure buyers (Wasm runtime companies, edge compute platforms, embedded systems).
