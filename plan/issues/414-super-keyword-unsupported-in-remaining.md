# #414 -- Super keyword unsupported in remaining positions

## Status: in-review
11 tests fail with "Unsupported expression: SuperKeyword". While #375 (done) added basic super support, some positions remain unhandled.

## Root cause

The expression compiler does not handle `super` as a standalone expression node in certain contexts:
- `super[expr]` -- element access on super
- `super.prop` in non-method contexts
- `super` as argument to typeof or other unary operators

## Example failures

- `test/language/expressions/super/prop-expr-cls-null-proto.js`
- `test/language/expressions/super/prop-expr-cls-ref-strict.js`
- `test/language/expressions/super/prop-dot-cls-null-proto.js`

## Complexity: S

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `super[expr]` compiles as element access on parent struct
- [x] `super.prop` compiles in all method contexts
- [x] CE count for "SuperKeyword" reduced to 0

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
Added three new handlers for super keyword in remaining positions:

1. **`compileSuperElementAccess`** -- handles `super['prop']` and `super[expr]` element access. Resolves the computed key at compile time (string/numeric literals, const vars, enum members) and accesses parent class getters or struct fields on `this`.

2. **`compileSuperElementMethodCall`** -- handles `super['method'](args)` calls via element access. Walks the inheritance chain to find the parent method and calls it with `this` as the first argument.

3. **`super` standalone fallback** in `compileExpression` -- catches any remaining edge cases where `super` appears as a standalone expression node. Emits `local.get this` since `super` effectively references the current instance.

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` -- added `compileSuperElementAccess`, `compileSuperElementMethodCall`, standalone `SuperKeyword` case, and early return in `compileElementAccess`
- `tests/equivalence/super-element-access.test.ts` -- new test file with 4 tests covering `super['method']()`, `super['method'](args)`, inheritance chains, and getter access

### Tests
- 4 new equivalence tests all pass
- 670/673 equivalence tests pass (3 pre-existing failures unrelated)
