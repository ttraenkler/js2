# Issue #576: Expand TEST_CATEGORIES to cover all test262 categories

## Problem

The `TEST_CATEGORIES` list in `tests/test262-runner.ts` was trimmed and only covered
~10,501 of the ~53,010 test files in the test262 suite. Many entire categories of
built-ins and language features were missing.

## Solution

Expanded `TEST_CATEGORIES` to cover 100% of test262 test files (53,010 files across
96 categories). Key changes:

1. Consolidated fine-grained entries (e.g., individual `built-ins/Math/abs`, `built-ins/Math/ceil`)
   into parent-level entries (e.g., `built-ins/Math`) where the `findTestFiles()` function
   walks recursively and covers all children.

2. Added all missing `language/` top-level categories (arguments-object, asi, block-scope,
   comments, identifiers, literals, module-code, etc.)

3. Added all missing `built-ins/` categories (Date, RegExp, Function, Error, Symbol,
   TypedArray, BigInt, WeakMap, WeakSet, Iterator, Temporal, etc.)

4. Added top-level categories: annexB, harness, intl402, staging

5. Fixed 4 entries that pointed to non-existent directories (Number/EPSILON, Number/NaN,
   Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, Number/MIN_SAFE_INTEGER) by using parent `built-ins/Number`.

## Implementation Summary

- **Files changed**: `tests/test262-runner.ts`
- **Before**: 248 entries covering ~10,501 files (with 4 broken entries pointing to non-dirs)
- **After**: 96 entries covering 53,010 files (100% of test262/test)
- **Approach**: Use parent-level entries for recursive walking instead of listing every leaf
