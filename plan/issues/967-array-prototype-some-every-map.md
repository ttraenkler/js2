# #967 — Array.prototype.some/every/map not a function

## Problem

30 tests fail with "some/every/map is not a function" after #799 prototype chain merge. Array prototype methods don't resolve through the new prototype lookup path.

## Sample files

- test/built-ins/Array/prototype/every/15.4.4.16-1-9.js
- test/built-ins/Array/prototype/some/15.4.4.17-8-10.js
- test/built-ins/Array/prototype/map/15.4.4.19-9-11.js

## Likely Cause

#799 changed property access in expressions.ts and property-access.ts. The prototype chain lookup intercepts Array method calls but doesn't fall through to the existing Array method handler.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Array.prototype.some/every/map resolve correctly
- No regressions vs sprint 37 baseline
