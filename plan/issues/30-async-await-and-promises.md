# Issue 30: Async/await and Promises

## Status: done

## Summary
Support `async function`, `await`, and `Promise` types.

## Motivation
Async code is ubiquitous in TypeScript. Without it, any code using `fetch()`, timers, or event-driven patterns cannot be compiled.

## Design

### Challenge
Wasm is synchronous — there is no native async execution model. Possible approaches:

### Option A: JSPI (JS Promise Integration)
The WebAssembly JS Promise Integration proposal allows Wasm functions to suspend and resume when a Promise resolves. This maps naturally to `await`:
- `async function` → Wasm function wrapped with JSPI
- `await expr` → call expr, suspend until Promise resolves, resume with result

Requires engine support (Chrome 123+ behind flag, not yet widely available).

### Option B: CPS transformation
Transform async functions into continuation-passing style at the IR level. Each `await` splits the function into segments connected by callbacks. This works on all engines but significantly increases code complexity and binary size.

### Option C: Host-delegated
Mark async functions as externref-returning and delegate the actual async orchestration to the JS host. The Wasm module produces synchronous building blocks, and the host chains them with Promises.

### Recommendation
Option C for near-term (practical, no engine requirements). Option A as the long-term target when JSPI ships.

## Scope
- `src/codegen/functions.ts` — handle `AsyncFunctionDeclaration`
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — handle `AwaitExpression`
- `src/ir/types.ts` — async-related IR constructs
- Tests: new `tests/async.test.ts`

## Complexity: L

## Acceptance criteria
- `async function fetchData(): Promise<string> { ... }` compiles
- `await` suspends and resumes correctly
- Returned Promise resolves with the correct value
