# #1022 — Array built-in methods throw "object is not a function"

## Problem

**640 test262 failures** (99%+ concentrated in `test/built-ins/Array/`) fail with `object is not a function`. This is a single concentrated bucket — almost certainly a single root cause in Array method dispatch.

## Investigation approach

1. Sample 10-15 failing tests from `test/built-ins/Array/` in `benchmarks/results/test262-current.jsonl`
2. Look for the common pattern — is it a specific Array method? Is it related to callback invocation? Is it a host import receiving the wrong type?
3. The error message `object is not a function` is JS-thrown — something is calling `.call()` or similar on a non-callable value

## Hypotheses

- `__extern_method_call` being called with a non-function receiver
- Array prototype method dispatch failing for custom iterables
- Callback argument being passed as a struct ref instead of a function ref
- Missing host import for some Array method (e.g. `Array.of`, `Array.from`)

## Expected impact

640 FAIL → likely 500+ pass if root cause is a single dispatch path.

## Key files
- `src/codegen/array-methods.ts`
- `src/runtime.ts` — Array method host imports
- `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts` — method call dispatch

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§23.1.3 Properties of the Array Prototype Object](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-array-prototype-object) — all Array.prototype methods must be callable as ordinary functions
- [§10.2.1 \[\[Call\]\]](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-function-objects-call-thisargument-argumentslist) — method dispatch requires a callable \[\[Call\]\] internal method


## Root Cause

When TypeScript compiles a named function like `function callbackfn(val, idx, obj) {}`, the compiler wraps it in a WasmGC closure struct. When `Array.prototype.every.call(obj, callbackfn)` falls through to the `__proto_method_call` host import, JS receives the opaque WasmGC struct as the callback — JS cannot call it as a function, hence "object is not a function".

## Fix

Added `compileArrayLikePrototypeCall` in `src/codegen/array-methods.ts` that:
1. Detects when the receiver is `any`-typed (no static array type info)
2. Detects when the callback will compile to a Wasm closure struct
3. Emits a Wasm-native loop that uses:
   - `__extern_length(externref) -> f64` to get the length property
   - `__extern_get_idx(externref, f64) -> externref` to get elements (new import, bypasses _safeGet's symbol ID check for indices 1-12)
   - `call_ref` to invoke the closure's funcref directly — no JS bridge needed

Added `__extern_get_idx` handler to `src/runtime.ts` with struct getter fallback (`__sget_N`).
Updated `__extern_length` in `src/runtime.ts` to fall back to `__sget_length` export for WasmGC structs.

## Test Results

### Phase 1: Fix "object is not a function" (PR #68)
- 10/10 custom issue tests pass (`tests/issue-1022.test.ts`)
- Sampled 5 actual test262 failing tests:
  - `15.4.4.16-3-24.js` → **PASS** (was "object is not a function")
  - `15.4.4.16-3-1.js` → **PASS** (was "object is not a function")
  - `15.4.4.16-2-10.js` → FAIL (assertion error, NOT "object is not a function") ✓
  - `15.4.4.20-2-6.js` → FAIL (assertion error, NOT "object is not a function") ✓
  - `15.4.4.18-1-14.js` → FAIL (assertion error, NOT "object is not a function") ✓
- CI result: net +199 pass, but 26 regressions introduced

### Phase 2: Fix 26 PR #68 regressions

**Root causes identified:**
- **Fix A** — map/filter/reduce in `ARRAY_LIKE_METHOD_SET` caused: `length:"Infinity"` objects → `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s(Infinity) = 2147483647` → compile_timeout; also WasmGC struct callbacks → assertion errors. Fix: removed map/filter/reduce/reduceRight from set (fall back to `__proto_method_call`).
- **Fix B** — 0-param callbacks pushed `elem` anyway → Wasm type validation error. Fix: guard `numParams >= 1`.
- **Fix C** — null/undefined receiver compiled to Wasm-native loop but no TypeError thrown. Fix: detect null/undefined receiver → return undefined (fall back to `__proto_method_call`).
- **Fix D** — void callbacks (`returnType === null`) with `[drop, i32.const 1]` → drop on empty stack → invalid Wasm. Fix: check `returnType === null` first → emit just `[i32.const 1]`.

**Results (13/13 regression tests pass):**
- Fix A: 18/18 regressions fixed (map/filter/reduce tests)
- Fix B+D: 3/3 regressions fixed (void `() => {}` callback for every/some/findIndex)
- Fix C: 2/2 regressions fixed (null receiver find/findIndex)
- 3 getter tests not fixable without sidecar property descriptor support (every/some/forEach `7-c-i-30.js`)
- All 10 original issue tests still pass (`tests/issue-1022.test.ts`)
