# #169 — Arrow function edge cases

## Problem
Arrow function IIFE patterns like `(() => 1)()` and `((a) => a + 1)(1)` were not supported. The compiler failed with "Unsupported call expression" when calling arrow functions or function expressions directly.

## Fix
Added IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) support in `compileCallExpression`:
- Unwrap `ParenthesizedExpression` to find arrow/function expressions being called
- For concise-body arrows (`() => expr`), inline the expression
- For block-body arrows/functions, compile into a wasm `block` with return patching
- Handle parameter binding by allocating locals for IIFE arguments

## Tests unblocked
- `language/expressions/arrow-function/syntax/variations.js` now passes
- Arrow function: 19 → 20 pass, 94 → 93 compile_error

## Status: Done
## Complexity: XS
