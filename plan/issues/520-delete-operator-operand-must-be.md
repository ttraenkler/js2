# #520 — Delete operator: operand must be optional (80 CE)

## Status: in-review
80 tests fail with "The operand of a 'delete' operator must be optional" (62) or "cannot be a read-only property" (18). TypeScript's strict mode rejects `delete obj.prop` unless the property is optional.

## Approach

For test262 compilation (allowJs mode), suppress these TypeScript diagnostics. The `delete` operator should compile to setting the field to a sentinel value (see #492).

## Complexity: S

## Implementation Summary

Added two TS diagnostic codes to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES` in `src/compiler.ts`:
- **2790** - "The operand of a 'delete' operator must be optional" (62 CE)
- **2704** - "The operand of a 'delete' operator cannot be a read-only property" (18 CE)

Code 2703 ("must be a property reference") was already suppressed. These two additional codes complete the set of delete-operator diagnostics that block valid JS from compiling.

### Files changed
- `src/compiler.ts` -- added codes 2704, 2790 to `DOWNGRADE_DIAG_CODES`
