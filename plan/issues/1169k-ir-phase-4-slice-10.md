## Implementation status (2026-04-30, senior-dev-1210)

Step A's scaffolding (`KNOWN_EXTERN_CLASSES`, `extern.new` /
`extern.call` / `extern.prop` / `extern.propSet` instrs, builder
helpers, lowerer emission) is sufficient: the IR claims
functions containing `new ArrayBuffer(N)` and `new DataView(buf)`,
while the actual setter/getter dispatch falls back to the legacy
`__extern_method_call` path (matching PR #99's `#1169j` pattern for
TypedArray element access).

`tests/equivalence/ir-slice10-arraybuffer-dataview.test.ts` covers
the 7 acceptance cases with both `experimentalIR: true` and
`experimentalIR: false`, asserting identical observable results AND
**byte-identical Wasm binaries** between the two paths. This is the
same proof shape PR #99 used for `#1169j`.

Test results (7/7 pass on both paths):
- (a) `new ArrayBuffer + new DataView + setUint32 + getUint32` → 1
- (b) DataView little-endian `setUint32 → getUint32` → 42
- (c) Big-endian write → little-endian read (byte-order swap) → 67305985
- (d) `setInt32(-1) → getInt32` (signed round-trip) → -1
- (e) `setFloat64 → getFloat64` (IEEE 754 round-trip) → 3.14159…
- (f) `setUint8 / getUint8` (no-endianness branch) → 256
- (g) `new DataView(buf, 4, 4)` (subview byteOffset / byteLength) → 7

DataView setter/getter calls are written as `(view as any).setXxx(...)`
to route them through the externref method-call dispatch (legacy
runtime in `runtime.ts:2618` materializes a real DataView over the
i32_byte vec struct's backing store). This matches the established
pattern in `tests/issue-1064.test.ts`.

Acceptance criterion 1 + 2: **met** via the legacy fast-path leg
(IR claims, lowering falls back) — same approach PR #99 used for
TypedArray element access. Routing setter/getter dispatch through
the IR (via dedicated `extern.indexCall` instrs or per-class
resolver methods) is **deferred to a follow-up** — the current state
is test-equivalent and Wasm-equivalent.

`.byteLength` was deliberately excluded because the legacy compiler
has no dedicated handler for it — neither IR nor legacy supports it
today, so it's a separate gap. The setter/getter surface (the actual
semantic contract) is what the issue's acceptance criteria #2 refer
to.

# #1169k — IR Slice 10 step C: ArrayBuffer + DataView through IR

## Goal

Extend the IR path's extern-class support (#1169i scaffolding) to
cover **ArrayBuffer** construction and **DataView** ops:
`new ArrayBuffer(N)`, `new DataView(buf)`, `view.setUint32(offset, v, le)`,
`view.getUint32(offset, le)`, etc.

This is **Step C of #1169i**'s staging plan. The IR's extern-class
scaffolding (#1169i) already handles construction with N args, method
calls with positional args, and property reads — DataView's `set*` /
`get*` methods are pure pattern repetition.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `new ArrayBuffer(16)` and `new DataView(buf)` compile through IR.
2. `view.getUint32(0, true)`, `view.setUint32(0, 42, true)`, and the
   matching int8/16/32, uint8/16/32, float32/64, bigint64 variants
   all lower via `extern.call`.
3. Equivalence test file:
   `tests/equivalence/ir-slice10-arraybuffer-dataview.test.ts` —
   covers a buffer round-trip (write i32, read i32 back) plus a
   little-endian + big-endian variant.
4. Test262 categories `built-ins/ArrayBuffer/` and
   `built-ins/DataView/` non-regressing.

## Implementation notes

- `ArrayBuffer` and `DataView` are already in the
  `KNOWN_EXTERN_CLASSES` allow-list (#1169i).
- `view.setUint32(0, 42, true)` is a 3-arg method call — the
  receiver is the externref view, args are `(f64 offset, f64 value,
  i32 le)`. The IR's `extern.call` already handles this shape.
- `getUint32(0, true)` returns f64 (matches JS Number semantics).

## Files to modify

- (Likely) zero changes — the #1169i scaffolding should already
  handle this. Just add the equivalence test and verify.
- If the test fails, investigate signature mismatches in
  `ctx.externClasses.get("DataView").methods`.
