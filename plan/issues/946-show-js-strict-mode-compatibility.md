# #946 — Show JS strict mode compatibility by default

## Problem

The landing page, report.html, and dashboard show total test262 pass rates without distinguishing strict vs sloppy mode. Since ECMAScript modules are always strict mode and most modern JS is strict, the default view should show strict mode compatibility.

## Requirements

1. **Default view**: Show only strict-mode test results on landing page, report, and dashboard
2. **Report page toggle**: Add a "Strict mode only" toggle button (checked by default) that filters results to strict-mode tests when enabled, shows all tests when disabled
3. **Data source**: test262 tests have a `flags` field in frontmatter with `onlyStrict` or `noStrict`. Tests without either flag run in both modes. The JSONL results should include this info.

## Implementation

1. In `tests/test262-runner.ts`: add `strict` field to JSONL output based on test frontmatter flags
2. In `scripts/run-test262-vitest.sh` report generation: add strict-mode breakdown to the report JSON
3. In report.html: add toggle UI, filter displayed results
4. In landing page + dashboard: use strict-mode counts by default
5. In `components/t262-charts.js`: support `strict-only` attribute on donut/edition components

## Acceptance criteria

- Landing page shows strict-mode pass rate by default
- Report page has working toggle between strict-only and all modes
- Dashboard shows strict-mode numbers
- Toggle state persists across page reloads (localStorage)
