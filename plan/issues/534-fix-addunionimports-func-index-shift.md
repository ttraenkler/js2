# #534 -- Fix addUnionImports func index shift for parent function bodies during nested closure compilation

## Symptoms

2 test262 tests fail with `WebAssembly.instantiate(): Compiling function #8:"test" failed: expected 0 elements on the stack for fallthru, found 2`:
- `language/expressions/addition/bigint-and-number.js`
- `language/expressions/subtraction/bigint-and-number.js`

## Root cause

When `addUnionImports` is called during nested closure compilation (e.g., compiling `function() { Object(1n) + 1; }` inside a test function), it shifts function indices in:
1. `ctx.mod.functions` (already-compiled functions)
2. `ctx.currentFunc.body` (the closure being compiled)
3. `ctx.currentFunc.savedBodies` (saved body arrays of the current function)

But it does NOT shift indices in **parent function contexts** saved on the call stack via `const savedFunc = ctx.currentFunc`. This means call instructions emitted earlier in the parent function (before the closure triggered `addUnionImports`) retain stale indices.

Example: `assert_throws` at index 0 (before imports) becomes index 7 (after imports). Closures compiled before `addUnionImports` correctly have their bodies shifted, but the parent function's `call 0` (to assert_throws) is NOT shifted, causing it to call `__unbox_number_import` instead. Since `__unbox_number_import` returns f64 while assert_throws returns void, each misrouted call leaves an extra f64 on the stack.

## Fix

Added `funcStack: FunctionContext[]` to `CodegenContext`. When `ctx.currentFunc` is saved/restored during nested function compilation (closures, nested function declarations, class methods, getters/setters), the parent context is pushed/popped to `funcStack`. `addUnionImports` now iterates `funcStack` and shifts indices in all parent bodies and their saved bodies, avoiding double-shifts via a `Set<Instr[]>`.

## Implementation Summary

### What was done
- Added `funcStack: FunctionContext[]` field to `CodegenContext` interface and both initializers
- Updated `addUnionImports` to iterate `ctx.funcStack` and shift all parent function body arrays
- Added `push`/`pop` calls at all 11 save/restore pairs in `expressions.ts` and `statements.ts`

### Files changed
- `src/codegen/index.ts` — added `funcStack` field, initialization, and shifting logic in `addUnionImports`
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — 9 save/restore pairs updated (closures, callbacks, class methods/getters/setters, object literal methods)
- `src/codegen/statements.ts` — 2 save/restore pairs updated (nested function declarations)
- `tests/bigint-cross-type.test.ts` — new test exercising the fix
- `tests/stack-cleanup-fallthru.test.ts` — new test for general stack cleanup

### Tests now passing
- `bigint-cross-type.test.ts` (3 tests) — validates Wasm binary for mixed bigint/number patterns
- `stack-cleanup-fallthru.test.ts` (5 tests) — general expression statement stack cleanup
- test262 `bigint-and-number.js` (addition, subtraction) — no longer compile_error
