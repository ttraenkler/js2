# #1927 — Single front-end pipeline driver

## Problem

The compile pipeline exists as three ~450-line near-clones with **divergent
feature sets** (`src/compiler.ts:467` `compileSourceSync`, `:894`
`compileMultiSource`, `:1195` `compileFilesSource`):

- `detectEarlyErrors`, `rewriteEvalSuperCall`, hardened mode,
  `preprocessImports`, the JS-mode retry, and the timer shim run **only** on
  the single-source path. Multi-file compiles silently skip ES early errors
  entirely.
- `compileFilesSource` also skips define substitution and the CJS rewrite.
- `generateMultiModule` is not passed `experimentalIR`, `nodeBuiltins`,
  `wasiNodeFsFuncs`, `allowFs`, or `jsxRuntime` (`compiler.ts:1013-1022` vs
  `:701-720`) — multi-file users silently get a weaker, different compiler.
- The ~25-line error-return object is copy-pasted **14 times** across the file.
- Doc drift: `index.ts:213-216` says `experimentalIR` "Defaults to off";
  `compiler.ts:714` defaults it on.

Every new option or phase must be added in three places; missing one is
silent.

## Proposed approach

1. Extract `runPipeline(ast: TypedAST | MultiTypedAST, opts)` with an
   explicit ordered phase list (rewrites → parse/check → diagnostic triage →
   early errors → safe/hardened validation → codegen → post passes → emit).
2. Entry points differ only in how they build the AST(s); everything below
   the parse is shared.
3. One `failResult(errors)` helper replaces the 14 copies.
4. Phase applicability (e.g. CJS rewrite per-file in multi mode) is data on
   the phase, not a fork of the driver.
5. Fix the `experimentalIR` doc/default mismatch while there.

## Acceptance criteria

- Multi-file compile reports ES early errors (regression test: duplicate
  `let` in a second file).
- Option-plumbing parity test: the options object reaching codegen is
  identical for equivalent single/multi invocations.
- `compiler.ts` shrinks by ≥800 lines; equivalence + test262 green.

## Source

Compiler quality review 2026-06. Related: #1931 (early-error decomposition
rides on this), #1929.

## Sprint-62 planning amendment (2026-06-12)

Verified at main 682e22d76: still 3 driver clones in `compiler.ts`
(`compileSourceSync:467`, `compileMultiSource:894`, `compileFilesSource:1195`)
**plus a 4th** — `generateMultiModule` (`codegen/index.ts:4151`) never runs
the IR overlay at all (`experimentalIR` consulted only in `generateModule:1195`),
and the multi paths skip `detectEarlyErrors` + hardened mode and drop
`experimentalIR`/`nodeBuiltins`/`wasiNodeFsFuncs`/`allowFs`/`jsxRuntime`.

Added acceptance criteria:
- multi-module paths gain IR / early-errors / hardened-mode **parity** (or
  a single driver makes the question moot);
- the ~14 copy-pasted ~25-line error-return objects collapse to one
  `failResult` helper;
- driver consumes the structured severities from #1921 (no
  `"Codegen error:"` prefix matching).

Scheduled sprint 62, `model: fable` (the proposal's "blocks nothing in the
June corpus" parking applied a conformance lens; under the architecture
lens this is the keystone).
