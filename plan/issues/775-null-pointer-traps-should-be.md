# #775 -- Null pointer traps should be catchable TypeError (1,604 tests)

## Problem

1,604 tests fail with "dereferencing a null pointer" — a Wasm trap that crashes the module. These should throw a catchable TypeError instead. The previous attempt (#728) was too broad and was reverted (commit 19cedca9).

## Root cause

When property access, method calls, or element access operate on null/undefined values, the Wasm `struct.get` or `ref.as_non_null` instruction traps. Unlike type-mismatch nulls (where ref.cast fails on wrong struct types), these are genuinely null values that need TypeError throws.

## CRITICAL: Lessons from #728 (reverted)

The previous attempt tried post-processing passes (inserting ref.test/ref.as_non_null guards after codegen). This was attempted 7+ times and ALL caused massive regressions (+5,000-7,000 CE). The Wasm type stack breaks when instructions are inserted after codegen.

**The correct approach is codegen-time guards:** add null checks at the point where expressions are compiled, when types are known. Do NOT add post-passes.

## Fix approach

At each dereference site, emit:
```wasm
local.tee $tmp
ref.is_null
if
  ;; throw TypeError via exception tag
  ref.null extern
  throw $exnTag
end
local.get $tmp
;; ... proceed with dereference
```

Priority order by impact:
1. `compilePropertyAccess` — property access on null (~500 tests)
2. `compileElementAccess` — element access on null (~300 tests)
3. `compileCallExpression` — method calls on null (~500 tests)
4. `compileForOfStatement` — iteration on null (~200 tests)
5. Remaining paths (~104 tests)

## Key constraint

- ONLY touch compilePropertyAccess, compileElementAccess, compileCallExpression, compileForOfStatement
- Do NOT touch compileIdentifier — that's #771's territory
- Do NOT use post-processing passes — codegen-time only

## Acceptance criteria

- Null dereferences throw catchable TypeError
- Type mismatches still return defaults or try alternate structs
- No regressions (run full test262 before declaring done)
- Net gain ≥800 tests (not all 1,604 will be fixed by null guards alone)

## Implementation Notes

### Changes made (codegen-time guards, no post-passes):

1. **`compileElementAccess`** (property-access.ts): Changed `ref_null` null guard from
   returning default values to throwing TypeError via `emitNullCheckThrow`. Also added
   null check for `externref` path. This is the simplest and most impactful change -
   replaces a complex if/else block with a concise null-check-then-proceed pattern.

2. **`compileForOfArray`** (statements.ts): Changed null guard from `br_if` (silently skip
   loop) to `throw $exnTag` (TypeError). In JS, `for (const x of null)` throws TypeError.

3. **`compileForOfString`** (statements.ts): Same pattern as ForOfArray - throw TypeError
   instead of silently skipping.

4. **`compileForOfIterator`** (statements.ts): Added null check on the externref iterable
   value before calling `__iterator` host import. Prevents passing null to the host which
   would cause "obj[Symbol.iterator] is not a function" at host boundary.

### What was NOT changed (already handled):

- **`compilePropertyAccess`** (property-access.ts): Already throws TypeError on null via
  `emitNullGuardedStructGet` (when propName is provided) and `typeErrorThrowInstrs` in
  the externref fallback path (line 1171-1179).

- **`compileCallExpression`** (expressions.ts): Method calls go through
  `compilePropertyAccess` first (to resolve the method), which already guards null.
  Direct function calls don't dereference an object, so no null guard needed.

### Pattern used:
All guards use the existing `emitNullCheckThrow` / `typeErrorThrowInstrs` infrastructure
from property-access.ts, which emits: `local.tee $tmp; ref.is_null; if (throw); end; local.get $tmp`

### Post-implementation status (2026-03-25)

The null guard system is working but over-triggering. The `emitNullGuardedStructGet` function uses `ref.test $Struct` to check for null, but this also fails for valid objects of a different struct type. This causes 15,630 tests to fail with "TypeError (null/undefined access)" for valid property accesses.

**Follow-up issue: #789** -- Fix the guard to only fire for actually-null references, not type mismatches.
