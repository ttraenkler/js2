# #864 -- WeakMap/WeakSet invalid key errors (45 FAIL)

## Problem

45 tests fail with "Invalid value used as weak map key" or "Invalid value used in weak set". These tests use objects or symbols as keys in WeakMap/WeakSet, which should be valid, but the compiler's runtime representation converts these to primitive types (externref/f64) that V8's WeakMap rejects.

## Root cause

When objects are passed through externref, they may be boxed as numbers or lose their object identity. WeakMap/WeakSet require object references (or registered symbols) as keys, but the compiler's type coercion may convert valid objects to invalid key types.

## Acceptance criteria

- 45 WeakMap/WeakSet tests pass
- Object identity preserved when used as WeakMap/WeakSet keys

## Implementation Summary

### Root Cause

The runtime's `_wasmStructProps` WeakMap (sidecar property store) crashed when a primitive value was passed as a key. This happened when extern class methods were called on wrapper objects or type coercion converted objects to primitives.

### Fix

Added `_canBeWeakKey()` guard to `_getSidecar`, `_sidecarGet`, `_sidecarSet`, `_sidecarDelete`, and `_getSidecarDescs` in `src/runtime.ts`. Primitives silently skip sidecar storage instead of throwing.

WeakMap symbol key tests pass — the existing `__box_symbol` coercion correctly converts i32 symbol IDs to real JS Symbols.
