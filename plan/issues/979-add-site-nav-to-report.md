# #979 — Report page: add nav bar + landing page styling

## Problem

The report page (`public/benchmarks/report.html`) has its own standalone styling that doesn't match the landing page. It also lacks the shared `<site-nav>` component.

## What to build

1. Add `<script src="../../components/site-nav.js"></script>` and `<site-nav base="../../"></site-nav>` to the report page
2. Update the report page CSS to match the landing page:
   - Background: `#060a14` (from `#0d1117`)
   - Surfaces: white-opacity based (`rgba(255,255,255,0.05)`)
   - Borders: `rgba(255,255,255,0.12)` 
   - Text: white / `rgba(255,255,255,0.68)` / `rgba(255,255,255,0.46)`
   - Font: Inter for body, JetBrains Mono for code
   - No rounded corners on panels
   - Chart colors: white-opacity palette (matching edition charts on landing page)
3. Add `padding-top: 64px` to body to clear fixed nav
4. Ensure the strict mode toggle and all interactive features still work

## Reference

- Landing page CSS variables in `index.html` `:root` block
- Dashboard styling (already adapted) in `dashboard/index.html`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Report page has the same nav bar as landing page and dashboard
- Color scheme matches landing page (dark blue bg, white-opacity surfaces)
- All existing features (chart, table, strict toggle) still work
- Responsive on mobile
