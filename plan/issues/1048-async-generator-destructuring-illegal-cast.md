# #1048 — async-generator destructuring: illegal cast inside __closure_N

## Problem

Async-generator parameter/body destructuring emits a ref.cast inside one of the generator state-machine closures (`__closure_N`) whose runtime value is a different ref type, trapping with `illegal cast`.

## Evidence from harvest

- **Test count:** 75 tests currently failing with this pattern
- **Top path buckets:**
  - `75 test/language/expressions/async-generator/dstr/*`
- **Top error messages:**
  - 24× `L64:3 illegal cast [in __closure_2()]`
- **Sample test files:**
  - `test/language/expressions/async-generator/dstr/ary-ptrn-rest-id-iter-step-err.js`
  - `test/language/expressions/async-generator/dstr/named-ary-ptrn-elem-id-init-unresolvable.js`
  - `test/language/expressions/async-generator/dstr/named-dflt-obj-init-null.js`

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§27.6.3.2 AsyncGeneratorStart](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-asyncgeneratorstart) — initializes async generator execution context
- [§15.8.4 Runtime Semantics: EvaluateAsyncFunctionBody](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-evaluateasyncfunctionbody) — async generator body evaluation with yield/await interaction


## Root cause hypothesis

The dstr lowering path stores the iterator/result in a cell with a narrowed ref type, but the async-generator state machine reloads that cell in a sibling closure where the captured type is wider (e.g. `anyref`/externref). The reload emits a `ref.cast` to the narrow type which fails for values produced by the async pause/resume transform.

## Fix

Unify the capture type for iterator/step-result cells used in async-generator dstr so the reload path does not need a narrowing cast, or replace the cast with `ref.test` + branchless fallback.

## Expected impact

~75 FAIL.

## Key files

- src/codegen/expressions.ts (dstr lowering)
- async-generator codegen (state machine closure emission)
