# #812 -- Test262Error "no dependency provided for extern class" (801 tests)

## Problem

801 tests fail with `No dependency provided for extern class "Test262Error"`. The test harness injects `Test262Error` as a global class, but the compiler doesn't recognize it as a known class and emits an extern class reference that can't be resolved at instantiation.

## Root cause

The preamble/harness injection provides `Test262Error` as a JavaScript class, but when the test code does `new Test262Error(...)` or `throw new Test262Error(...)`, the compiler treats it as an unknown extern class constructor instead of using the host-provided constructor.

## Fix approach

1. In the test262 preamble, register `Test262Error` as a known constructor that maps to `new Error(message)` or a dedicated host import `__new_Test262Error(msg) -> externref`
2. Alternatively, add `Test262Error` to the list of recognized global constructors (like `Error`, `TypeError`, `RangeError`)
3. The constructor should accept a string message and produce an object with `.message` property

## Files to modify
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — recognize Test262Error as a known constructor
- `tests/test262-runner.ts` or preamble — ensure Test262Error is available

## Acceptance criteria
- `new Test262Error(msg)` compiles without extern class dependency error
- `throw new Test262Error()` works in try/catch
- 801 tests unblocked

## Complexity: XS
