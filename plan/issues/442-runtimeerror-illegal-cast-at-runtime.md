# #442 -- RuntimeError: illegal cast at runtime (6 fail)

## Problem

6 tests fail at runtime with "RuntimeError: illegal cast". The compiler emits a `ref.cast` instruction that fails because the actual runtime type does not match the expected cast target.

This typically happens when:
- The compiler infers a more specific type than the actual runtime value
- Union types are narrowed incorrectly, and a ref.cast to a specific struct type fails on a value of a different struct type
- Externref values are cast to internal ref types without proper conversion

## Priority: low (6 tests)

## Complexity: XS

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Identify the specific cast sites causing failures
- [ ] Fix type narrowing or add runtime type checks before cast
- [ ] All 6 illegal cast failures resolved
