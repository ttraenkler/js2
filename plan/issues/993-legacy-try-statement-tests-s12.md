# #993 -- Legacy try-statement tests S12.14_A9/A11/A12_T3 hit 30s compiler timeout

## Problem

The latest full recheck (`benchmarks/results/test262-results-20260407-005506.jsonl`)
contains **3 compile timeouts** in the same old `try` statement family:

- `test/language/statements/try/S12.14_A9_T3.js`
- `test/language/statements/try/S12.14_A11_T3.js`
- `test/language/statements/try/S12.14_A12_T3.js`

This cluster costs another **90s worker time** per full run.

## Why this is a real bucket

These files are from the same legacy `try` statement section and likely share a
single problematic lowering path in:

- abrupt completion handling
- nested try/catch/finally control flow
- catch/finally value propagation

## Existing context

The repo already has multiple historical `try`/`catch` issues, but these
specific files are currently timing out rather than surfacing as CE/FAIL. That
means they are not well covered by existing correctness issues.

## ECMAScript spec reference

- [§14.15 The try Statement](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-try-statement) — TryStatement with catch/finally clauses
- [§14.15.2 Runtime Semantics: CatchClauseEvaluation](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-catchclauseevaluation) — binds caught value


## Suggested fix

1. Reproduce `S12.14_A9_T3.js` in isolation with compile timing
2. Inspect whether `try` lowering or stack-balance/finally rewriting explodes
3. Fix the shared pathological path and recheck all three files together

## Acceptance criteria

- all 3 `S12.14_*_T3` tests compile in <5s locally
- no `compile_timeout` remains for this cluster in a full recheck
