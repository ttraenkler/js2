# #611 — Compiler crash: Cannot read 'kind' of undefined (2,995 CE)

## Status: in-progress

2,995 tests crash the compiler with "Internal error compiling expression/statement: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'kind')". Split:
- 2,750 in expression compilation
- 245 in statement compilation

### Root cause analysis

The compiler accesses `.kind` on an AST node that is `undefined`. Common triggers from test file analysis:

1. **`not-a-constructor.js` tests** (Math.sqrt/cbrt/etc.): These test `assert.throws(TypeError, () => new Math.sqrt())`. The `new` expression on a non-constructor hits a code path where the callee AST node's type is not resolved. **Line L33:5** across ~200 Math method tests.

2. **Class elements with private getters/setters**: `static-private-getter-access-on-inner-class.js` — nested class with private member access produces an AST shape the compiler doesn't expect. **Line L47:7**.

3. **import.meta in async/generator contexts**: `goal-async-function-params-or-body.js` — import.meta inside async function params. **Line L40:5**.

### Fix

Add defensive null checks in `compileExpression` and `compileStatement` before accessing `.kind`:
```typescript
if (!node) {
  ctx.errors.push({ message: "unexpected undefined AST node", ... });
  return VOID_RESULT;
}
```

This won't fix the underlying issue (missing AST handling) but prevents crashes and reports errors properly.

## Complexity: S (null guard) + M (fix underlying patterns)
