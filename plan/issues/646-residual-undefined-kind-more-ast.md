# #646 — Residual undefined .kind: more AST node handlers (5,329 CE)

## Status: open

5,329 tests still hit the null guard from #611/#619. The remaining unhandled AST node types include:
- Async generator method parameters
- Decorator expressions
- Computed class field initializers with complex expressions
- Optional chain in various positions
- Template literal expressions in certain contexts

### Fix
Analyze the most common line numbers to identify which AST patterns need handlers. Add cases to compileExpression/compileStatement switch.

## Complexity: M
