# dev-c — Session Context Summary

**Session span**: 2026-04-25 17:48 → 18:06 UTC (sprint 45 ci team)
**Branch worked**: `issue-906-compile-away-tdz`
**Shutdown trigger**: team-lead `shutdown_request` while PR #28 CI in flight

## Current state at shutdown

### Issue #906 — Compile away TDZ tracking → PR #28 OPEN, CI in progress
- **Worktree**: `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-906`
- **Branch**: `issue-906-compile-away-tdz` HEAD `9662ac0cb71ec54331b45db3c27026208d673858`
- **PR**: https://github.com/loopdive/js2/pull/28 (base=main, head=9662ac0cb)
- **Status**: 16 test262 shards + quality + benchmarks `IN_PROGRESS` at shutdown time

### What I did this session

1. Read dev-e's handoff (`plan/agent-context/dev-e-906.md`) and issue spec (`plan/issues/sprints/45/906.md`).
2. Confirmed pre-existing worktree `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-906` (initial HEAD `f05bd0e97`, dev-e's last merge of main).
3. `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main` — clean merge, no conflicts. New HEAD `9662ac0cb`.
4. Acquired `/tmp/ts2wasm-test-lock`, ran:
   - `npm test -- tests/issue-906.test.ts` → **11/11 pass** in 8.41s
   - `npm test -- tests/equivalence/` → **105 failed / 1186 passed** in 642.80s (vs dev-e's main baseline of 106F / 1185P → **+1 improvement, 0 regressions**)
   - Released the lock.
5. `git push origin issue-906-compile-away-tdz` (delta `f05bd0e97..9662ac0cb`).
6. Opened **PR #28** with full context referencing dev-e's drift analysis and current equivalence delta.
7. Started background CI watcher `bgkry2mz3` polling `until [ -s /workspace/.claude/ci-status/pr-28.json ]; do sleep 60; done`. **This watcher is still running at shutdown.**

### What's left for the next dev

1. **Wait for CI**. Either:
   - Resume the background poll: `until [ -s /workspace/.claude/ci-status/pr-28.json ]; do sleep 60; done; cat /workspace/.claude/ci-status/pr-28.json`
   - Or check `gh pr checks 28` directly.
2. **Verify SHA match**: the file's `sha` must equal `9662ac0cb71ec54331b45db3c27026208d673858`. If not, my push raced or someone else pushed; re-evaluate.
3. **Self-merge gate**:
   - `net_per_test ≥ 0` AND no single error bucket >50 regressions AND no >10% regression-to-improvement ratio → `gh pr merge 28 --admin --merge`
   - Otherwise sample regressions locally from `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-906`. Per dev-e's prior drift analysis (PR #19), 17/17 sampled CI regressions passed locally; identical equivalence results vs main. Treat any cluster that passes locally as drift.
4. **After merge**:
   - Move issue file `plan/issues/sprints/45/906.md` to done state (frontmatter `status: done`).
   - Update `plan/log/dependency-graph.md` (remove #906).
   - Update `plan/issues/backlog/backlog.md` if relevant.
   - TaskUpdate task #3 → completed.
   - Notify team-lead: "PR #28 merged, #906 done."

## Tooling note (recurring)

This session's agent did NOT have `TaskUpdate` or `SendMessage` tools exposed — only `Read/Edit/Write/Bash/Agent`. All status reporting went through the conversation channel. If next dev has the same toolset, they'll need to either (a) use the harness's higher-level tools, or (b) report status via their reply channel and not block on TaskUpdate.

## Branch / PR audit

- Commits ahead of `origin/main` at shutdown:
  - `9662ac0cb` Merge origin/main (this session)
  - `f05bd0e97` Merge origin/main (dev-e)
  - `bb1b65289` plan(#906): mark status review and add implementation notes (dev-e)
  - `f625f8743` fix(#906): compile away TDZ tracking for definite-assignment top-level let/const (dev-e)
- Working tree clean. No uncommitted changes.

## Files touched (carried over from dev-e, no new edits this session)

- `src/codegen/expressions/identifiers.ts` — `computeElidableTopLevelTdzNames` helper (+66 lines)
- `src/codegen/expressions.ts` — re-export (+6/-1)
- `src/codegen/declarations.ts` — call site + import (+15)
- `tests/issue-906.test.ts` — 11 regression tests (+157)
- `plan/issues/sprints/45/906.md` — implementation notes

This session's net contribution: refresh-merge of main + fresh PR + equivalence sweep validating 0 regressions. Code unchanged from dev-e's commit.
