# Scrum Master Context — Sprint 31

**Last active**: 2026-03-29
**Sprint**: 31 (in progress)

## What was done this session

1. **Sprint-30 retrospective written** — `plan/issues/sprints/30/sprint.md`
   - 7 incidents documented with root causes and 12 action items
   - Key themes: #822 merged/reverted twice (no architect spec), devs treating "code done" as "task done", stale dependency graph wasting cycles

2. **Action items applied** (committed as `1f08809d`):
   - A1/A2: equivalence tests mandatory before signaling completion (developer.md)
   - A3: tech lead MUST run equiv tests post-merge (pre-merge-checklist.md)
   - A5/A6: "completed" = merged, wait for merge confirm before next task (developer.md)
   - A8: smoke-test candidate issues before dispatch (session-start-checklist.md)
   - A10: batch doc commits after agent merges (CLAUDE.md)
   - A11: remove `git fetch origin main` from rebase instructions (developer.md)

3. **Sprint-31 planning input given to PO**:
   - 1 task per dev at a time (not 2) — enforced via task dependencies
   - Stretch goal (#828) kept but not pre-committed
   - Smoke-test all candidates before dispatch (PO confirmed done)
   - Flagged: #822 needs architect spec (A4) — verify spec exists before dev work

## Still open (not yet applied)

- **A4**: #822 needs-architect tag — verify an architect spec was written before current wave completes
- **A7**: Post-merge issue completion enforcement — process discipline, no file change needed
- **A9**: PO re-validates top issues at planning — PO confirmed they did this for sprint-31

## Process state

- CLAUDE.md updated with refined interaction flow (sprint planning as collaborative PO+Architect+TL process)
- Checklists: pre-commit, pre-completion, pre-merge, session-start all exist and have retro improvements
- Task list has duplicate entries (#3/#4, #5/#6, #7/#9, #8/#10) — minor, tech lead should clean up

## Next retro should check

- Did the "1 task at a time" + task dependency gates eliminate the rebase-churn pattern?
- Did A5/A6 (wait for merge confirm) actually change dev behavior, or do agents still move on?
- Did #822 get an architect spec this time? Did the spec-first approach produce better results?
- Were there any stale issues dispatched despite the smoke-test step?
- Did doc commit batching (A10) reduce unnecessary rebases?
