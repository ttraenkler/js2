## CURRENT STATE (as of 2026-04-27)

### Baseline
- **25,802 pass / 43,168 total = 59.8%**
- Baseline refreshed 2026-04-27T14:57Z (forced refresh after 618-test drift)
- Sprint 45 started at ~25,387, ended at 25,802+

### What shipped in Sprint 45 (today's session)
4 PRs merged:
- PR #72 (#1185 IrLowerResolver refactor, net=+1398, ratio=7.2%)
- PR #73 (#1169f IR slice 7b generators/async, net=+1202, admin-merged at 10.8%)
- PR #74 (#1186 str-charat-fix, merged but superseded by #75)
- PR #75 (#1186 forof-string-charat, net=+1234, ratio=8.7%) — canonical fix

### Open PRs (do NOT admin-merge without investigation)
- **PR #76** (`issue-1177-tdz-closure`): net=+1159, regr=199, ratio=14.7%, snapshot_delta=-31
  — Hold. Negative snapshot_delta is a red flag. TDZ closure Stage 1.
  — Branch HEAD: `fe1225f5`, CI is fresh and accurate.
- **PR #77** (`issue-1192-ct-classification`): CI tooling only (3 files, no compiler changes)
  — Branch merged with main on 2026-04-27T15:44. Wait for fresh CI result.
  — If ratio <10% after fresh CI: self-merge. It should be near-zero regressions.

### Sprint 46 — ready to dispatch
9 issues in `plan/issues/sprints/46/`:
- 1169g (IR slice 8 — destructuring/rest/spread)
- 1169h (IR slice 9 — try/catch/finally)
- 1169i (IR slice 10 — remaining builtins: RegExp, TypedArray, DataView)
- 1169 (IR Phase 4 umbrella — retire legacy AST→Wasm once all slices done)
- 1180 (WASI unbox: env::__unbox_number host imports on --target wasi)
- 1187 (test-runtime: JS-string → native-string coercion helper)
- 1188 (Setup js2.loopdive.com custom domain for GitHub Pages)
- 1080 (CI baseline-drift umbrella)
- 1126 (Infer int32/uint32 lowering from flow)

Also in ready/ for S46/S47:
- 1177 (after PR #76 regressions are fixed)
- 1193 (ci-status-watcher.sh fix — easy, S46)
- 1195-1200 (array perf sprint — escape analysis, bounds elim, i32 specialization)
- 1189-1192 (from dev-1125-bench array benchmark work)

### Agent context summaries
⚠️ All 3 dev agents had broken inbox delivery this session — could not process messages.
No context summaries were written by agents. State captured here instead:
- **dev-1125-bench**: Worked on #1186 (PR #75 merged), #1192 (PR #77 pending CI), 
  filed issues #1189-1200 for S47 array perf work.
- **dev-1182**: Worked on #1185 (PR #72 merged). Did not investigate PR #76 (unresponsive).
- **dev-1169f-7a**: Worked on #1169f slice 7b (PR #73 admin-merged). 
  145 real regressions remain from slice 7b — need followup issue for S46.

### Tooling shipped this session
- `scripts/statusline-sprint.mjs` — sprint progress script (used by statusline-command.sh)
- `scripts/next-issue-id.mjs` — read-only PREVIEW of the next free issue number (`pnpm run preview:issue-id`); does NOT reserve. To ALLOCATE an id, use the atomic reserver `node scripts/claim-issue.mjs --allocate` (`pnpm run new:issue-id`).
- `.claude/statusline-command.sh` — updated with sprint bar + days-left bar
- `.claude/settings.json` — statusLine wired to statusline-command.sh with 30s refresh

### Key protocol notes
- Baseline refresh: use `refresh-baseline.yml` with `force_baseline_refresh=true` + `confirm_force=YES`
- The "refresh-benchmarks" CI job fails on all PRs (missing playground baseline) — this is infra noise, not a test failure. Ignore `conclusion: failure` and look at net/ratio/snapshot_delta instead.
- Weekly token budget resets: check `rate_limits.seven_day.resets_at` in statusline JSON input — current reset was Apr 30, 10am Europe/Berlin

## 2026-07-21 — Sprint 74 pause / v0.65.0 release boundary

### Delivered

- #3529 and #3519 complete the IR retirement R0 boundary: typed terminal
  outcomes, complete unit accounting, and the honest `check:ir-only` policy
  gate are delivered.
- Full equivalence is back to zero new failures without baseline expansion.
  One baseline-known case now passes and was intentionally left unratcheted.
- The bounded hybrid lane is green at 31 / 37 IR-emitted units, with six typed
  Unsupported units, zero Invariants, and no unaccounted units. Strict is
  intentionally red on the same six typed blockers and all 37 legacy-emitted
  bodies.
- v0.64.1 is the verified starting release. After this sprint-close change
  lands, cut v0.65.0 from fresh `origin/main`; do not publish its tag until the
  release commit is itself on `main`.

### Resume point

- Execution is paused at the clean R0/release boundary. #3518 remains open.
- #3520 is ready and is the only next IR-retirement slice: source-qualified
  `IrUnitId` plus the whole-program `ProgramAbiMap`.
- Keep R2–R8 blocked until #3520 and their declared dependency chain land. Do
  not interpret the hybrid-green gate as permission to flip the default or
  weaken the six strict typed blockers.
