| #55 | docs(benchmarks): split deployment-size view into raw vs cwasm; soften wording (#1125) | **MERGED** at 02:04:00Z | `010793e71` |
| #56 | docs(benchmarks): add deployment-savings analysis (storage, CPU time, $) (#1125 follow-up) | **MERGED** at 02:12:58Z | `0d25e197a` |

All five PRs were self-merged after CI confirmed `quality` SUCCESS + `cla-check` SUCCESS. The `refresh-benchmarks` FAILURE was systemic baseline drift hitting every recent PR (#50, #51, #52, #54, #55, #56 identically — also other open PRs like #53). README-only PRs cannot have introduced this drift. Plan/README-only PRs were excluded from test262 by path filter.

Each PR's correction was prompted by user (project-lead) review:
- PR #55 fixed an inconsistency in PR #51/#52's "Total deployment size for N functions" table (mixed measurement units across columns) and softened tone.
- PR #56 added the deployment-savings analysis (storage savings, cumulative CPU-time savings, parameterised Fastly $/CPU-sec formula, Shopify Functions limit-based "what fits in the envelope" framing) — translates the runtime+size data into operational savings figures customers can verify.

## Key decisions

- **wasmtime version pinned to "latest" not v40**. The user explicitly asked
  not to pin to 40.0.0. Verified against `https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/latest` — latest is `v44.0.0` at session time, used for all benchmark runs. The harness comment documents the floor as `>= 40` (because that's when `--invoke "fn(args)"` syntax for components shipped) but no upper pin.
- **`-W exceptions=y` is required and re-added.** Was removed in v31, came back in v40. Required because the StarlingMonkey embedding emits Wasm exception bytecode for SpiderMonkey's exception machinery.
- **Component invocation works via wasmtime 40+'s parenthesized syntax**: `--invoke "run(5000)"` and `--invoke "run-hot(5,20000000)"`. Older wasmtimes (30, 31) reject `--invoke` against components — verified this directly. Two new helper functions added (`measureWasmtimeComponentInvocation`, `measureWasmtimeComponentHotInvocation`).
- **Javy uses Shopify-style dynamic mode by default.** New env var `JAVY_DYNAMIC` (default `1` when plugin available). Builds with `-C dynamic=y -C plugin=…`, runs with `--preload javy-default-plugin-v3=…`. Per-function module shrinks from ~1.2 MB (static) to ~3 kB (dynamic) — matches Shopify Functions' production deployment shape.
- **Naming cleaned up**: "StarlingMonkey" used consistently for the embedding (the deployed Wasm component, the WIT bindings, the WASI shim). "SpiderMonkey" reserved for engine-internal references (interpreter loop, exception machinery). Documented the distinction in the README.
- **Wizer + Weval verified empirically, not just by metadata sidecar**. A/B comparison on fib (`STARLINGMONKEY_COMPONENTIZE_AOT=0` vs `=1`): +137 % compile time, +24 % component size when AOT is on. The +24 % matches the README's documented ~25 % expectation.

## Open threads / unresolved

- **All PRs from this session are merged.** Nothing left to ship.

- **Three new sprint-45 issues filed and ready for pickup** (created in PR #54, all `priority: high`, `status: ready`):
  - **#1173** — array-sum benchmark crash. js2wasm output uses 'exact' reference types that wasmtime 44 rejects (*custom descriptors required for exact reference types*). Fix: drop the `exact` modifier in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` (array-literal / `__vec_*` emission) or `src/codegen/type-coercion.ts`.
  - **#1174** — object-ops benchmark crash. js2wasm leaks `string_constants::a,b,c` host import on `--target wasi`. Fix: route object-literal property keys through `nativeStrings` in `src/codegen/expressions.ts::compileObjectLiteralExpression`.
  - **#1175** — string-hash benchmark crash. String `+=` codegen routes through numeric type-coercion (`f64.convert_i32_s` → `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s`) and lands wrong-typed args at `__str_flatten`/`concat` calls. Fix: classify RHS of string `+=` as a string-typed value in `src/codegen/expressions.ts` / `type-coercion.ts`.

- **StarlingMonkey dynamic-link mode (Shopify-equivalent)**: user asked whether StarlingMonkey supports a Javy-style dynamic mode. **Answer: not as of `componentize-js` 0.20.0 / wasmtime 44.** Building blocks exist (`wasm-tools compose`, library components, weval cache) but no first-class flow yet. Could be a future issue: "implement dynamic-linking adapter for ComponentizeJS to amortize the 14 MB embedding across functions". The fib hot-runtime delta (StarlingMonkey 1242 ms vs Javy 1453 ms) and per-function size (14 MB vs 3 kB) make this an obvious follow-up.

- **Optional follow-up: `node --jitless` baseline lane.** During the JIT-discussion thread the user pointed out that the Node.js baseline IS using V8's full JIT, while Javy / StarlingMonkey are interpreter-only inside Wasm. Adding a `node --jitless` lane (~30 lines in the harness) would isolate "interpreter quality" vs "JIT availability" and make the four-lane comparison fully apples-to-apples on the language-runtime layer. The js2wasm-vs-Javy ratio itself wouldn't change — but the explanation of where the speedup comes from would become much clearer in the README. Not filed as an issue; recorded here for whoever picks up future benchmark work.

- **Optional follow-up: real RSS instrumentation in the harness.** The PR #56 savings section includes a caveat noting that runtime memory savings are not currently measured — cwasm size is a *floor*, not the full picture. Wrapping `wasmtime run` in `/usr/bin/time -v` or polling `/proc/<pid>/status` `VmRSS` from each `measure*Invocation` helper, capturing peak and steady-state RSS into the JSON, and rendering memory columns in the runtime tables would close that gap. ~80–120 lines in `compare-runtimes.ts` plus a fresh benchmark run on wasmtime 44 to capture per-lane peak memory. Plausible numbers: js2wasm ≈ 200 kB cwasm + small linear memory; Javy ≈ 200 kB user cwasm + 4.87 MB shared plugin + few-MB QuickJS heap; StarlingMonkey ≈ 53 MB cwasm + ~10–30 MB SpiderMonkey heap. Could be ~50–100× RAM ratio at 100 concurrent instances. Worth filing as a sprint-45 issue if benchmark-realism matters for sales/customer conversations.

- **Optional follow-up: a `compute-savings.mts` script.** The PR #56 savings tables are derived inline by hand from the per-call hot deltas. A small TypeScript helper (e.g. `scripts/compute-savings.mts`) that reads `runtime-compare-latest.json` and emits the savings tables for any (workload, monthly-invocations, $/CPU-sec) tuple would future-proof the math and let customers / sales engineers regenerate the tables without re-doing the arithmetic by hand. ~50 lines.

- **An earlier statement I made was wrong and should not be repeated:** I claimed "js2wasm's 80× advantage over Javy on fib would shrink to ~1× when comparing against Node --jitless" — that's false. The 80× ratio is independent of the Node baseline. The user caught it; the corrected framing lives in the conversation transcript and the cleaned-up README in PR #52. The corrected take: js2wasm and Javy/StarlingMonkey both run "no JIT", but for different structural reasons (compile-time-only design vs sandbox-forbidden guest JIT). The 80× gap measures "compiled Wasm vs interpreter-running-on-Wasm" overhead.

- **Component invocation hot-runtime numbers vary across runs.** First fib-only run reported `hot=9337 ms`; subsequent full-suite run reported `hot=1111-1241 ms`. Likely Weval cache state difference between runs (the cache is in `node_modules/.../weval/`). Not a correctness problem, but worth noting if a follow-up wants stable hot numbers — could pin the Weval cache or warm it before each run.

## Proposed and accepted

- Use latest wasmtime (v44, not pinned to v40).
- Add Javy lane with Shopify-style dynamic linking.
- Clean up SpiderMonkey vs StarlingMonkey naming.
- Take "ours" for `runtime-compare-latest.json` conflicts on every merge from main (the file is regenerated by CI so it conflicts every time main moves).

## Proposed and not pursued

- Modifying ComponentizeJS to emit a `wasi:cli/run` world for direct `wasmtime run` invocation. Not needed once v40's `--invoke "fn(args)"` syntax was discovered.
- Adding a Node-side `jco transpile` invocation path for components. Not needed for the same reason.

## Files written/modified (now all on main via PR #51, #52, #54)

- `benchmarks/compare-runtimes.ts` (3 commits worth)
  - `WASMTIME_WASM_FLAGS` updated for v40+ (`gc=y,function-references=y,component-model=y,exceptions=y`).
  - `measureWasmtimeComponentInvocation` / `measureWasmtimeComponentHotInvocation` added.
  - `JAVY_DYNAMIC`, `JAVY_PLUGIN_PRELOAD_NAME` added.
  - `buildJavyRunArgs`, plugin precompile, `--preload` wiring.
  - `evaluateStarlingMonkeyComponentize` dispatches to module-style or component-style invocation based on `metadata.kind`.

- `benchmarks/competitive/README.md`
  - Verified-results section with all four lanes (Node.js, js2wasm, Javy dynamic, StarlingMonkey + ComponentizeJS Wizer+Weval).
  - Total deployment size table for N functions.
  - "JIT and serverless Wasm" explainer (clarifies why hot numbers are interpreter-only).
  - Wizer-only vs Wizer+Weval A/B verification (proves Weval is doing real work).
  - Shopify Functions production setup documented.
  - SpiderMonkey/StarlingMonkey naming clarified.

- `benchmarks/results/runtime-compare-latest.json`
  - Verified run on wasmtime 44.0.0, all four lanes, all five programs.

- `plan/issues/sprints/45/1173.md`, `1174.md`, `1175.md` (PR #54)
  - Three issue files for js2wasm benchmark crashes, all priority: high, ready.

- `plan/issues/sprints/45/sprint.md` (PR #54)
  - Goal section updated with "crash bucket surfaced by #1125 verification" reference.
  - Issue table auto-regenerated via `node scripts/sync-sprint-issue-tables.mjs`.

## Note on Sonnet vs Opus model usage

This was a straightforward dev task (benchmark harness fix + documentation), not a compiler-architecture problem. Sonnet handled it end-to-end. No need to escalate to Opus on resumption unless the StarlingMonkey-dynamic-mode follow-up is taken on (that one needs design + `wasm-tools compose` work, which would benefit from Opus).

# Resume session — 2026-04-27 ~05:30 UTC

Picked up the labs-restructure / PR-#59 cleanup thread the same morning. Two tasks delivered.

## Task 1 — labs-restructure push + PR validation

- Worktree `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/labs-restructure`, branch `labs/restructure-private-to-labs-folder`, HEAD `0c7c654e9` (the bench refresh commit).
- `git push labs HEAD:labs/restructure-private-to-labs-folder` → **Everything up-to-date** (already pushed at 04:32 UTC during the original session).
- PR `loopdive/js2wasm-labs#1` already open with that exact head SHA. Updated its body to add a `## Benchmark refresh on top of the restructure` section: fib 17.7 ms (slightly beats Node 18.4 ms hot), fib-recursive ≈ Node, object-ops ~2.7× slower than Node, array-sum ~9.2× slower than Node and ~14% slower than Javy (tracked as #1179), string-hash compiles after #1175 but traps at runtime (tracked as #1178). Also clarified that **PR #59 (public) and labs PR #1 are companions, not alternatives** — both should land.

## Task 2 — PR #59 sync with main

- Worktree `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/public-cleanup`, branch `chore/remove-private-content-from-public` was 39 commits behind `origin/main` and CONFLICTING.
- `git merge origin/main` produced 2 conflicts, both `deleted-by-us`:
  - `benchmarks/compare-runtimes.ts` → `git rm` (PR #59's whole purpose is to delete it; the moved copy lives at `labs/benchmarks/compare-runtimes.ts` in the private repo).
  - `benchmarks/results/runtime-compare-latest.json` → `git rm`.
- `.claude/hooks/check-cwd.sh` auto-merged cleanly to `origin/main`'s **TECH_LEAD env-var** version (verified byte-identical via `git diff origin/main`). The new gate replaces the older CHECKLIST-FOXTROT-string check; agents spawn without sourcing `~/.zshrc` so they can't inherit `TECH_LEAD=1`, which prevents the prior CHECKLIST-FOXTROT-string spoofing vector.
- Verified the staged diff contains zero private content: no `benchmarks/competitive/`, no `blog/`, no `docs/`, no `scripts/setup-benchmark-vendors.mjs`, no `scripts/generate-wasmtime-chart-data.mjs`, no `scripts/starlingmonkey-componentize-adapter.mjs`.
- Committed as `bf1fbff85` (`merge: sync with main, take TECH_LEAD hook version [CHECKLIST-FOXTROT]`) and pushed to origin (`b9cfc23f3..bf1fbff85`).
- `gh api` post-push: PR #59 head_sha `bf1fbff85`, **mergeable: true** (was CONFLICTING), mergeable_state `unstable` (CI running on new HEAD).

## Operational note for next time

The team-lead initially asked me to "open a PR" for the labs-restructure branch. There were two structural confounders I had to surface twice before it became actionable:

1. The branch's own first commit installs a `.husky/pre-push` hook that **refuses** to push `labs/` paths to `loopdive/js2.git`. So a PR for that branch on origin isn't producible without `--no-verify`. Confirmed via `git push --dry-run origin HEAD` — hook listed all 28 labs/ paths and exit 1.
2. The "PR doesn't exist" perception was because the existing PR is on **`loopdive/js2wasm-labs`** (the private fork), not origin. Both repos have a `main`; `gh pr list` defaults to the origin remote and so didn't surface labs PR #1.

Future labs-side work: verify PR existence via `gh pr list --repo loopdive/js2wasm-labs` rather than relying on default-remote `gh pr list`. Also: the labs repo's CI is broken (labs/main itself fails the "CI Status Feed" workflow), so the "self-merge on net_per_test ≥ 0" criterion doesn't apply over there — labs PRs need a human merge call.

## Final state at shutdown

| PR | Repo | Head | State | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1 | loopdive/js2wasm-labs | `0c7c654e9` | OPEN, mergeable | Restructure + bench refresh; CI on labs is systemically failing (preexisting) |
| #59 | loopdive/js2 | `bf1fbff85` | OPEN, mergeable | Public-side path deletions; CI running on new HEAD |

Per team-lead message at end of session: PR #59 merged successfully with the TECH_LEAD hook version preserved, private content removed from the public repo, labs branch already on the labs remote. Shutting down.

# Sprint-46 dev session — 2026-04-27 ~13:00 → 16:00 UTC

Pulled into a new round of work after the labs/public-cleanup thread closed. Three concurrent threads:

## Thread 1 — labs PR merge

User asked whether `loopdive/js2wasm-labs#1` (the labs side of the public/private split) was actually merged. I had earlier reported it as "ready, awaiting human merge call." User said "yes" → ran `gh pr merge 1 --repo loopdive/js2wasm-labs --admin --merge`. Merge commit `26b432adabbdb1d6f65831c51bd632e92b1ab5a3` at 10:59:30 UTC.

**Result**: private/public split now complete on both sides:
- `loopdive/js2` (public): competitor benchmarks, blog/, docs/, vendor scripts gone
- `loopdive/js2wasm-labs` (private): same paths under `labs/` + bench refresh + path-based pre-push hook

Verified zero `labs/` paths on origin/main and zero competitor content on origin/main. Caveat: git history on origin/main retains the original commits (PR #59 changes live state, not history).

## Thread 2 — competitive bench rerun (failed) → string-hash O(N²) finding

User asked for a fresh competitive bench run on the latest origin/main after #1173/#1174/#1175/#1177/#1178 fixes landed. Setup:
- New worktree `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/bench-rerun-2026-04-27b` from origin/main HEAD `9ccdda768`
- `git read-tree --prefix=labs/ -u refs/remotes/labs/main:labs` to splice the labs harness in
- Built `scripts/compiler-bundle.mjs` via esbuild
- Ran `node --experimental-strip-types labs/benchmarks/compare-runtimes.ts`

**Outcome — abandoned mid-run.** The js2wasm `string-hash.cwasm` lane with `runtimeArg=20000` ran for **10:52 of wasmtime CPU time** without finishing or crashing. Node does the same workload in ~162 ms. js2wasm is roughly **4,000× slower than Node** here.

**Interpretation**: PR #64's iterative `__str_flatten` (the #1178 fix) corrected the *crash* but the runtime is now pathologically slow — almost certainly O(N²) in the number of `+=` operations because the iterative version flattens the rope on every concat instead of deferring to read time.

**Action**: messaged team-lead asking for #1178 to be reopened (or filed as #1178-followup). Acceptance criterion proposed: `string-hash` `runtimeArg=20000` completes in ≤ 1.6 s. Likely fix direction: defer flatten until the rope is *read* (ConsString-tree style); accumulate `+=` operands as cons-tree nodes.

User then asked to filter out `string-hash` and re-run. Filtered run completed in 14:16 wall time with clean numbers in `labs/benchmarks/results/runtime-compare-latest.json` (timestamp 2026-04-27T14:09:37.854Z):

| Program | Node | js2wasm-wasmtime | Javy-wasmtime | StarlingMonkey-wasmtime |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| fib | 16.70 | **17.96** | 1349.58 | 1173.57 |
| fib-recursive | 9.97 | **9.85** | 102.91 | 190.75 |
| object-ops | 4.93 | **15.97** | 221.53 | 233.33 |
| array-sum | 15.68 | **145.51** | 132.35 | 153.01 |

**Headline**: js2wasm decisively wins numeric workloads vs Javy / StarlingMonkey (60–75× on fib, 10–19× on fib-recursive, 14–15× on object-ops). On `array-sum` we're tied with Javy and ~9× behind Node — file as #1179 follow-ups (which I did, see Thread 4).

## Thread 3 — issue #1186 (legacy compileForOfString stale __str_charAt)

Picked up #1186 from the TaskList. Worktree `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-1186-forof-string-charat`, branch `issue-1186-forof-string-charat`. Issue file in `plan/issues/ready/1186.md` had a clear problem statement and recommended Option A fix.

**Implementation**: replaced the early funcIdx capture in `compileForOfString` (`src/codegen/statements/loops.ts`) with two operations:
1. Fail-fast validation at the top (`ctx.nativeStrHelpers.has("__str_charAt")`)
2. Fresh name walk (`ctx.mod.functions[i].name === "__str_charAt"` → `ctx.numImportFuncs + i`) **just before emitting** the `call` instruction. Mirrors the IR resolver's #1183 pattern.

**Tests**: `tests/issue-1186.test.ts` with 7 cases including a deliberate late-imports trigger (typeof on a non-trivial value before the for-of). All 7 pass; #1183 + 125 adjacent tests still pass.

**Outcome**: PR #75 merged as commit `f3489e90e` at 15:38:46 UTC. **HOWEVER**: another agent on PR #74 had filed and merged the equivalent fix as commit `d21b81962` while my PR was resolving merge conflicts. The two fixes are functionally equivalent (their version captures once at top, mine re-resolves at emit). Took theirs via `git checkout --theirs` to avoid a duplicate-work merge fight; my PR's remaining contribution is the array-perf sprint follow-ups in Thread 4. Both PRs are reflected in main; commented on #74 to explain the cross-pollination.

## Thread 4 — six sprint follow-ups for array-sum perf gap

User triaged the four-loop array-sum analysis into Tier 1 + Tier 2. Filed all six issues. **Two rounds of ID collision** with parallel-agent activity required renumbering:

| Topic | Tier | Initial ID | Final ID | Sprint |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Escape-analysis scalarization (eliminate non-escaping arrays via loop fusion) | 1 | 1189 | **1195** | 47 |
| Bounds-check elimination via SSA on monotonic-index loops | 1 | 1190 | **1196** | 47 |
| i32 element specialization for `number[]` (`\| 0` / `& mask` / `>> n`) | 1 | 1191 | **1197** | 47 |
| Pre-size dense arrays at allocation site | 1 | 1192 | **1198** | 47 |
| Linear-memory backing for typed numeric arrays | 2 | 1193 | **1199** | 48 |
| Loop-invariant code motion in optimizer pass | 2 | 1194 | **1200** | 48 |

**Why two rounds**: between filing and merging:
- Round 1: another agent's CI/test262 batch landed at #1189–#1192 (forced renumber to #1195–#1198)
- Round 2: another agent filed a `ci-status-watcher` issue at #1193 (forced rename to #1199, took #1200 for #1194 to keep IDs clustered)

**Tier 1 expected impact**: combined, bring `array-sum` hot runtime from ~145 ms → ~30 ms (within ~2× of Node, 5–6× ahead of Javy / StarlingMonkey).

## Thread 5 — answered architectural question: linear memory vs WasmGC

User asked whether linear-memory backing (#1199) is *strictly* better than WasmGC arrays. Answer: **no, it's a trade-off**:
- Linear memory wins on per-element throughput (i32.load/i32.store ~2 cycles vs WasmGC array.get ~3-5 cycles), SIMD readiness, cache-layout control, no write barriers.
- WasmGC wins on safety, GC interop, polymorphism (mixed-type arrays), JS↔Wasm boundary semantics, and free perf wins as engines improve.
- For internal-only, non-escaping, i32-only arrays in hot loops: linear memory IS materially better today (2–5×).
- For everything else: WasmGC is the right choice.

#1199's spec is hybrid (Part 1 only — internal-only specialisation) for exactly this reason. Strategic angle: walking away from WasmGC for any non-trivial workload would weaken js2wasm's "compiled JS through WasmGC" story.

## Thread 6 — handed statusline work to team-lead

User asked for a Claude Code statusline sprint progress bar (e.g. " sprint 45 " colored by % done). I held off because it's outside #1186 scope and recommended team-lead spawn the `statusline-setup` agent. Statusline shipped on main during my session as commit `5d5d61f97` (`feat(statusline): sprint progress badge in Claude Code statusline`) — confirmed via merge log.

## Operational notes for next session

1. **Allocate an issue ID atomically with `node scripts/claim-issue.mjs --allocate` (`pnpm run new:issue-id`) BEFORE creating any issue file** — it RESERVES the id (first-push-wins on the `issue-assignments` ref) against main + open PRs, so concurrent branches can't collide. `scripts/next-issue-id.mjs` (`pnpm run preview:issue-id`) only PREDICTS `max+1` without reserving and races; use it for read-only visibility only, never to allocate. (Historical note: this session predated the atomic reserver and used the predictor `next-issue-id.mjs`, which landed as commit `e002a706f`.)

2. **Two agents working the same issue independently is a real failure mode.** PR #74 and PR #75 both fixed #1186 with functionally-equivalent patches. The `file-locks.md` mechanism gave both agents (me with `compileForOfString`, the other agent with whatever they claimed) false confidence. Consider:
   - File-locks should claim by ISSUE number, not just by function-in-file.
   - Or: TaskList claims should be enforced before starting work, with a single owner per issue.

3. **CI re-trigger via `git merge origin/main`** worked smoothly when baseline drift was suspected. Cleaner than `--allow-empty` because it brings the fresh baseline directly onto the branch. Worth adding as the recommended action in `.claude/skills/dev-self-merge.md`.

4. **The `bench-rerun-2026-04-27b` worktree** at `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/bench-rerun-2026-04-27b` is left in place per agent-don't-clean-own-worktrees rule. Tech-lead can `git worktree remove` when convenient. The labs splice in it (`git read-tree`) leaves no commits — the worktree is throwaway.

## Final state at shutdown

| Item | State |
