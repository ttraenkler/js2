# PO Context — Sprint 50 Planning Handoff

## What I delivered

Sprint 50 planning, approved by tech lead 2026-05-07 14:32 UTC.

### Decisions made

1. **S49 closed** (status `closing` in sprint file). 8 issues actually
   merged. Two of them (#1301, #1304) had stale `in-progress` status
   that was misleading the sprint board — corrected during this
   session via direct edits to the issue frontmatter.
2. **S50 opened** with theme: *closure / call dispatch correctness
   wave 2 + #1126 IR Stage 3.*
3. **Committed scope (6)**: #1298, #1306, #1126 Stage 3, #1302, #1303,
   #1305.
4. **Stretch (1)**: #1292 (un-skip Tier 2b/c/d after blockers land).
5. **#1223 demoted to backlog** by tech lead — third deferral
   stopped the carry. Tech lead to action the move.

### Routing decisions confirmed

- **#1298 + #1306** → architect for a shared spec (sibling bugs in
  `src/codegen/expressions/calls.ts`).
- **#1126 Stage 3** → senior-developer (Opus). Architect spec already
  in issue file lines 282-331 — no new spec needed.
- **#1305** → dev-actionable. Two-layer plan in issue file.
- **#1302** → dev-actionable. Suspended-work notes in worktree
  `issue-1302-flow-global-idx`. Resume in place.
- **#1303** → dev-actionable. Pair with #1305 (same legacy codegen
  layer gap).

## Files written this session

- `plan/issues/sprints/50/sprint.md` — sprint file (theme, goals,
  committed + stretch backlog, DoD).
- `plan/issues/sprints/50/sprint-planning.md` — discussion record
  (validation pass, decisions, routing rationale, open questions).
- `plan/issues/sprints/49/sprint.md` — added closure note, set status
  to `closing`, listed the 8 closed issues + carry-overs.
- `plan/issues/1301-closure-env-f64-anyref-mismatch.md` —
  status `in-progress` → `done`, completed 2026-05-04 (PR #216).
- `plan/issues/1304-typeof-externref-function-classification.md` —
  status `in-progress` → `done`, completed 2026-05-04 (PR #219).

## Outstanding wrap-up actions (tech-lead-owned)

1. Physical move of carry-over files from `sprints/49/` to
   `sprints/50/` via `git mv` for: #1126, #1199 (deferred to backlog),
   #1292, #1298, #1302, #1303, #1305, #1306.
2. Move #1223 to `plan/issues/backlog/` (tech-lead-approved during
   shutdown handoff).
3. Push `sprint/49` end tag and `sprint-50/begin` start tag.
4. Run `node scripts/sync-sprint-issue-tables.mjs` to refresh the
   generated tables in both sprint files.
5. Dedupe #1126 and #1199 between `sprints/49/` and `backlog/` (the
   sprint copy is authoritative).
6. Populate the TaskList in dispatch order:
   `#1298 → #1306 → #1126 S3 → #1302 → #1303/#1305 paired → #1292`.

## Key state for next PO session

- **test262 baseline**: 27,769 / 48,171 (57.7%) as of S48 close.
- **Active sprint**: 50 (started 2026-05-07).
- **Active worktrees with PO-relevant suspended work**:
  `issue-1302-flow-global-idx` (concrete findings in suspended-work
  notes — 212 imported + 46 declared globals = 258, but
  `__closure_837` references indices 258-266).
- **Goal-graph status**: npm-library-support is the active goal that
  S50's #1298/#1306 cluster directly serves; performance is served by
  #1126 Stage 3.
- **Watch list for next planning cycle**: once S50 closes, expect new
  failures to surface from un-skipping lodash Tier 2 fully and
  pushing into Hono Tier 6 / lodash Tier 3 (#1242 WeakMap strong-ref,
  #1243 for-in over compiled objects).

## Open process improvements (worth raising with SM at S50 retro)

1. **Status drift between issue files and sprint board**: #1301 and
   #1304 had been merged for ~3 days but their issue frontmatter
   still said `in-progress`, which made S49 look 33% less complete
   than it was. Suggest tech lead run a mechanical post-merge sweep
   that flips `status: in-progress` → `status: done` whenever a PR
   referencing the issue lands.
2. **Issue-number duplication across `sprints/{N}/` and `backlog/`**
   for #1126 and #1199 — the sprint copy is authoritative but both
   are listed in dashboards. Suggest the sync script flag
   duplicates.
3. **#1223 deferred 3 sprints**: a "two-deferral rule" would force a
   commit-or-close decision at the second carry-over instead of the
   third. Tech lead's S50 decision (move to backlog) sets the
   precedent.

## How to resume PO work

A new PO session can pick up by:

1. Reading this file + `plan/issues/sprints/50/sprint-planning.md` +
   `plan/issues/sprints/50/sprint.md`.
2. Checking S50 sprint progress via `git log --since='2026-05-07'`
   and the issue `status` fields in `plan/issues/sprints/50/`.
3. Watching for new failure patterns from `benchmarks/results/` and
   from devs reporting completion of S50 carry-over work.

## Approved shutdown 2026-05-07

Tech lead approved shutdown 2026-05-07 14:32 UTC after plan
acceptance. No outstanding work owned by PO. Replacing prior 2026-03-30
S31 stub.
