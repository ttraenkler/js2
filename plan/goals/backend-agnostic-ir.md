# Goal: backend-agnostic-ir

**The typed middle-end IR (`src/ir/`) is decoupled from any single backend, so it can lower to (1) WasmGC today, (2) linear memory, and (3) a future bytecode interpreter — without the IR presuming WasmGC.**

- **Status**: Active
- **Track**: Supporting / architecture track (parallel to conformance)
- **Target**: A documented backend-trait seam in `src/ir/lower.ts`; at least one node kind lowered through that seam to two backends; one proof point of a non-WasmGC backend.
- **Dependencies**: `compiler-architecture` (activatable). Builds on #1131 (SSA IR), #1527/codegen-axes doc, #1530 (phase out the warning fallback).

## Why

The codegen-axes doc (`docs/architecture/codegen-axes.md`) names two orthogonal
axes and makes one explicit admission:

> Today, IR adoption gives you a typed front-end on a **WasmGC backend**. The
> architecture admits an IR adoption on the linear backend (a
> `lower-linear.ts` sibling), but no AST node kind has demanded it yet.

In other words: the IR's `lower.ts` (~2,460 lines) emits `struct.new`,
`struct.get`, `array.get`, `ref.cast` *inline in its node switch*. There is no
backend boundary — the IR-node→Wasm-op mapping is hardcoded to WasmGC. The doc
itself lists the exact leak points (the "Current hidden bias" table). This is
acceptable as a one-backend-old state, but it blocks two strategic directions:

1. **The bytecode interpreter (#1584)** needs the IR to be lowerable to a
   *non-Wasm* target (a bytecode opcode stream executed by a dispatch loop).
   That is impossible while lowering is hardwired to emit Wasm GC ops.
2. **IR adoption on the linear backend** — `src/codegen-linear/` reads the AST
   directly today, duplicating front-end work the IR already does. Routing
   linear lowering through the IR removes that duplication for the node kinds
   where the front-end concern is identical and only the *op emission* differs.

The user's intent is to make the IR's instruction contract **backend-agnostic**
so a backend is a *visitor over IR nodes*, not a hardcoded switch arm. The IR
declares *what* (build a closure cell, read a vec element, box a scalar); the
backend decides *how* (WasmGC struct vs linear-memory offset vs bytecode op).

## Approach

This is a multi-sprint goal. Sprint 57 lands the first three issues — the
audit/seam, one two-backend proof, and a minimal bytecode proof point:

1. **Audit + seam definition** (#1713, `feasibility: hard`, needs architect
   spec) — enumerate every WasmGC-specific emission in `lower.ts` against the
   codegen-axes "hidden bias" table; define a `BackendEmitter` trait (the set
   of operations a backend must implement: `emitStructNew`, `emitFieldGet`,
   `emitArrayGet`, `emitBoxScalar`, `emitCallRef`, …) that captures the
   *intent* of each emission without naming Wasm ops. Deliver the trait
   interface + a `WasmGcEmitter` implementation that is behavior-identical to
   today's inline emission (pure refactor, zero conformance delta).
2. **Two-backend proof** (#1714) — pick ONE already-IR-owned, structurally
   simple node kind (recommend the vec/array length+element-read path, which
   `lower.ts` already lowers and which has a clean linear analogue) and lower
   it through the trait to BOTH the WasmGC emitter and a new
   `src/ir/lower-linear.ts` emitter. Prove the same IR node produces correct
   output on both backends via a focused equivalence test. This is the first
   node kind to "demand" the linear lift the codegen-axes doc anticipates.
3. **Bytecode proof point** (#1715) — a minimal bytecode emitter + TS dispatch
   loop for a *tiny* IR subset (arithmetic + locals + return + one branch),
   proving the trait can target a non-Wasm backend. This is the de-risking
   first slice of #1584's Phase 1, scoped down to "does the seam admit a
   bytecode backend at all" — NOT the full interpreter.
4. **#1530 alignment** (tracked, not a sprint-57 issue) — driving IR-owned
   node kinds forward feeds backend-agnosticism: a kind can only be lowered by
   multiple backends once it is IR-owned end-to-end.

## The bytecode-vs-extend-linear decision

Both #1714 (extend linear coverage via the trait) and #1715 (bytecode proof)
are in scope for Sprint 57 because they de-risk *different* claims:

- **#1714 (linear-via-trait)** proves the trait abstracts a backend that
  *already exists and is exercised by WASI*. Low risk, high architectural
  payoff, directly retires front-end duplication. This is the **primary**
  proof point — it must land.
- **#1715 (bytecode)** proves the trait can target a backend with a
  *fundamentally different execution model* (dispatch loop, not structured
  Wasm). Higher risk, scoped to a throwaway-grade minimal subset, gated behind
  #1713. This is the **stretch** proof point — it validates the #1584
  direction before that 8–12 week investment is committed.

Reasoning: extending the linear backend is the higher-value *first* proof
because it is grounded in a real, shipping target (WASI) and immediately
removes duplicated front-end work, whereas the bytecode interpreter is a large
speculative investment. But doing a *minimal* bytecode slice in the same sprint
is cheap insurance: if the trait cannot cleanly express a bytecode target, we
learn that for ~1 issue of effort instead of discovering it 8 weeks into #1584.

## Success criteria

- `lower.ts` no longer emits WasmGC ops inline for the audited node kinds;
  emission goes through a `BackendEmitter` trait whose `WasmGcEmitter`
  implementation is behavior-identical (zero conformance delta).
- At least one node kind is provably lowered to two backends (WasmGC + linear)
  from the same IR.
- A minimal bytecode backend exists as a proof point, executing a tiny IR
  subset through a dispatch loop, validating the #1584 direction.
- The codegen-axes "hidden bias" table is updated to reflect which leaks are
  now behind the trait.
