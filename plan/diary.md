## 2026-05-20 — Sprint 51 close / Sprint 52 start

**Sprint 51 closed** (2026-05-08 → 2026-05-20, 12 days including a week-long pause from context limit + Codex restructuring overlap).

**Results**: 26,777 → 28,147 pass (**+1,370 net**, 65.2%). 70 PRs merged. 34/50 issues done. 16 carried to S52.

**Key wins**: IR retirement gate (#1376) now enforced in CI. Spec-gap wave (#1358–#1382) closed array callbacks, string methods, iterator helpers, promise combinators, class builtins. IR slices #1370–#1374 retired class methods, extern whitelist, destructuring params. Branch audit recovered 10 unmerged PRs (#341–350) now in CI queue.

**Process issues**: Codex force-pushed to origin/main mid-sprint (rolled back); sprint file status drift (4 issues marked wrong); 10 issue files existed only in labs. Labs migration done this session: js2wasm-labs/main now = labs/ (private) + public/ (subtree).

**Sprint 52 started** (2026-05-20). Theme: spec-completeness continuation + wasm closure bridge. 7 dev agents dispatched day 1 on #1396 (+400 passes), #1431–#1434, #1437–#1438. 10 audit PRs in CI. Baseline: 28,147 / 43,160 (65.2%). Target: +1,500 → ~29,650.

## 2026-05-07 — Sprint 49 close / Sprint 50 start

**Sprint 49 closed.** 4-day sprint (2026-05-03 → 2026-05-07). 8 issues merged.

**Landed**: #1290 TS7 forEachChild compat, #1296 dashboard Wasm dogfood, #1297 Hono Tier 5 (Application + middleware), #1299 virtual dispatch fix, #1300 closure outer-param fix, #1301 closure env field-type fix, #1304 typeof externref function fix. Plus #1241 triage.

**Deferred to S50**: closure call dispatch wave 2 (#1298, #1306), lodash Tier 2 blocker cluster (#1302, #1303, #1305), #1126 IR Stage 3, #1292 lodash Tier 2 un-skip.

**Demoted to backlog**: #1223 TDZ async/gen sharing (third deferral, no test262 leverage).

**Sprint 50 started.** Theme: closure/call dispatch correctness wave 2 + #1126 IR Stage 3. Architect spec gating #1298+#1306; senior-dev on #1126 Stage 3. test262 baseline: 27,769 / 48,171 pass (57.7%).

## 2026-05-03 — Sprint 47 close

**Sprint 47 closed.** 3-day sprint (2026-05-01 → 2026-05-03). 631 commits, 50+ issues completed.

**Key results:**
- 26,247 / 43,088 = 60.9% pass (test suite trimmed from 46,632; ~2% net conformance gain)
- **IR migration complete**: Slices 11–14 landed — switch/operators, element access/array literals, String+Array prototype methods, legacy codegen (`expressions.ts`/`statements.ts`) retired
- **Performance**: escape-analysis scalarization, bounds-check elimination, i32 element specialization, pre-size dense arrays, struct field type inference Phase 2, eval/RegExp LRU cache
- **npm library support**: CJS module.exports + require(), optional chaining, ESLint Tier 1/2/3 stress tests, Hono Tier 2/3 stress tests, WeakMap fix, extern round-trip identity fix
- **TypeScript 7**: forEachChild compat helper + TS7 feature flag (#1288, #1290) — 132× cold parse speedup in test262 runner
- **CI quality**: wasm-hash noise filter (#1222), differential test262 (#1246), baseline drift prevention (#1235), runner pool timeout fix (#1227) — 156 false compile_timeouts eliminated
- **Conformance**: class/dstr defaults (408 failures), private fields, logical assignment, WeakMap dispatch, SameValue f64, OrdinaryToPrimitive TypeError, __any_eq i31ref vs HeapNumber

**Carries to Sprint 48:**
- #1223 TDZ async/gen writer+reader (blocked on #1177 Stage 1)
- #1126 int32/uint32 inference (needs architect spec)
- #1177 Stage 1 (needs senior-dev Opus)

**Baseline**: 26,247 / 43,088 = 60.9%
**Sprint 48 begins.** IR Slice 13d (Array methods), int32 inference, Function.bind, compile-timeout cluster, and standalone readiness are the headline priorities.

## 2026-05-01 — Sprint 46 mid-sprint session

**Sprint 46 active.** Started 2026-04-30; this session ran 2026-04-30 → 2026-05-01.
Context at 73% / weekly budget at 19% when compacting.

**PRs merged this session (PRs #94–#118):**

| PR | Issue | Description |
|---|---|---|
| #94 | #1187 | test-runtime JS-string→native-string coercion helper |
| #95 | #1211 | fib-recursive hosted Wasm validator fix |
| #96 | #1210 | string-hash GC pressure (str_copy_tree O(n²) → buffer) |
| #99 | #1169j | IR Slice 10 step B: TypedArray |
| #100 | #1169l | IR Slice 10 step D: Date/Error/Map/Set |
| #101 | #1169k | IR Slice 10 step C: ArrayBuffer + DataView |
| #102 | #1169m | IR Slice 10 step E: Promise (best-effort) |
| #103 | #1212 | Promise resolve/reject regression fix |
| #104 | #1201 | Per-path test262 scores + landing page |
| #105 | #1213 | refresh-benchmarks path fix (LFS migration) |
| #106 | #1203 | Differential testing harness vs V8 |

| #113 | #1198 | Pre-size dense arrays at allocation site (+15 tests) |
| #118 | #1184 | __str_copy_tree depth-bounded worklist (nativeStrings fix) |

**In CI / in progress at compact time:**
- PR #112 (#1218): baseline validator — awaiting baseline refresh then re-run
- PR #114 (#1220): Promise snapshot + prototype cleanup (+29 tests)
- PR #115 (#1221): WasmException outer-catch fix (~256 flaky tests)
- PR #117 (#1219): ArrayBindingPattern iter-close hang fix (26 CT tests)
- dev-3 → #1196 (bounds-check elimination)
- dev-4 → #1197 (i32 element specialization)
- senior-dev-1210 → #1216 (auto-commit benchmark baseline)
- dev-2 → #1217 (smoke-canary CI)
- senior-dev-1205 → #1205 PR #98 (TDZ boxing, in-progress)

**Key findings from investigation sprint:**
- `compile_timeout` in test262 is a **runtime** timeout (combined compile+execute), not a compile-only timeout. The 30s timer in compiler-pool.ts covers both. ~26 are genuine runtime hangs (iter-close bug), ~70+ are load-induced flakes.
- `[object WebAssembly.Exception]` flakiness (256 tests): fork-state poisoning. Outer catches in test262-worker.mjs missed instanceof WebAssembly.Exception → misclassified as compile_error. Fixed in PR #115.
- `Promise.resolve is not a function` (26 tests): Promise missing from _STATIC_SNAPSHOTS → fork contamination. Fixed in PR #114.
- `Cannot redefine property` (23 tests): mixed isolation bugs (3 fixable in PR #114) + real compiler bugs (instanceof TypeError, mapped arguments — deferred to S47).

**Baseline at session compact:** ~27,000 pass (60.2% adjusted for drift); committed baseline shows 25,813 due to runner variance in the latest promoted run. PRs #114/#115/#117 expected to push real rate to ~61%+ once CI confirms.

**Sprint 46 scope expanded mid-sprint:**
- Added credibility track issues (#1201, #1203, #1204) that were originally deferred to S47
- Added CI health issues (#1213, #1214, #1217, #1218, #1219, #1220, #1221) surfaced by investigation
- Added perf issues (#1196, #1197, #1198, #1184, #1216) from sprint 47 to keep team loaded
- Sprint = 1 week of token budget (new rule); pull next sprint's work when current issues drain

**Drift pattern documented:** Every PR today showed the same drift signature: net positive, but 22-30% regression ratio from Promise flakes + Temporal/annexB skip-list baseline staleness. Physical-impossibility override approved for all (PRs #94, #106, #109, #110, #113, #118).

## 2026-04-29 — Sprint 45 close

**Sprint 45 closed.** 6-day sprint (2026-04-23 → 2026-04-29).

**Key results:**
- +554 net test262 tests (baseline 25,276 → 25,830 = 59.8%)
- IR Phase 4 slices 6–10 all landed: generators (#1169f), destructuring (#1169g), try/catch (#1169h), RegExp/extern-class scaffolding (#1169i step A)
- IrLowerResolver refactor (#1185) cleared the per-feature shortcut debt across the IR system
- Competitive benchmark harness built in labs/ — 5 programs × 9 toolchain lanes; Javy static+dynamic split; Porffor and AssemblyScript lanes wired up
- Architecture Decision Records (#1202) and landing page architecture section (#1208) shipped
- CI baseline-drift hardening complete (#1076–#1080, #1192, #1191, #1193)
- #1177 (TDZ closure captures) reverted after 14.7% regressions — deferred to S46
- 3 new benchmark issues filed: #1209 (hosted ESM error), #1210 (string-hash GC timeout), #1211 (fib-recursive type mismatch)

**Baseline**: 25,830 / 43,168 = 59.8%
**Sprint 46 begins.** IR Slice 10 steps B–E, #1177 investigation, credibility track, and benchmark bug fixes are the headline priorities.

## 2026-04-23 — Sprint 43 close / Sprint 44 setup

**Sprint 43 closed.** Short 3-day sprint (2026-04-20 → 2026-04-23). 3 PRs merged:
IR Phase 1 + 2 (#1131, PRs #231 + #258) and CI merge split (#1076, PR #160).
Baseline held at 24,483 / 43,172 = 56.7% — all IR work is infrastructure.

Also in this session:
- **LFS migration** for `*.jsonl`, `*.log`, `*.wasm`, benchmark JSON files
- **GitHub Pages fixed** after LFS migration broke CI checkout (added `lfs: true` to all 6 affected workflows)
- **All GitHub Actions bumped** to Node.js 24-compatible versions (configure-pages v6, upload-pages-artifact v5, checkout v5, setup-node v6, download-artifact v7)
- **labs remote** (`js2wasm-labs`) set up as private repo for experimental/commercial development; `labs/*` branches blocked from origin via pre-push hook
- **Sprint 44 planned** with #1153 (compiler crashes) + #1168 (IR frontend widening) as headline priorities

**Baseline**: 24,483 / 43,172 = 56.7%
**Sprint 44 begins next.**

## 2026-04-24 — Sprint 44 close

**Sprint 44 closed.** 2-day sprint (2026-04-22 → 2026-04-24).

**Key results:**
- +793 net test262 tests (baseline 24,483 → 25,276 = 58.6%)
- IR Phase 3 complete: monomorphize + tagged-unions (#1167c, PR #13)
- IR infrastructure PRs (#1168, #1167a, #1167b, #1167c) all merged — 0 direct test gain but Phase 4 now unblocked
- LFS budget exhausted mid-sprint → baseline promotion CI job failed; fixed with `continue-on-error` workaround (#1078)
- Sprint grew too large (74 issues); 55 carried over to sprint 45

**Baseline**: 25,276 / 43,172 = 58.6%
**Sprint 45 begins with IR Phase 4 (#1169) now unblocked.**

## Sprint 48 — 2026-05-03

Single-day sprint running on ~15% remaining weekly budget. Focus: WebAssembly.Exception cascade (lodash/Hono), stress test tier expansion, CI infrastructure.

**Landed**: #1233 (IR Slice 13d), #1236 (i32 saturation), #1269/#1280 (struct field inference Ph3/Ph3b), #1282 (ESLint Tier 1), #1291 (lodash Tier 1b), #1293 (Hono Tier 4), #1294/#1295 (WasmException reclassification + re-throw), #1290 (TS7 forEachChild helper), #1200 (LICM closed with measurement).

**Infrastructure**: agent idle counter in statusline; CI-wait fast-path for test-only PRs; variance escalation pattern calibrated.

**Deferred to S49**: lodash Tier 2 (#1292), closure/virtual-dispatch gap fixes (#1299–#1304), Hono Tier 5 (#1297), GitHub Pages Wasm dogfood (#1296). Hard issues (#1126 int32 inference, #1199 linear-memory) → backlog.

## Sprint 50 — 2026-05-07 → 2026-05-08

Sprint 50 ran as a transition sprint: began as "closure/call dispatch wave 2" but pivoted into a large spec-completeness audit. Ended at ~28,140 test262 passes (~58.5%).

**Key work landed**:
- #1311–#1319 wave: await passthrough, closure stack underflow, error message context, Symbol.toPrimitive, import.defer early error
- #1321 Number.prototype formatting — pure Wasm (eliminated JS host)
- #1322 Math.random() — WASI random_get in standalone mode
- #1327 Landing page: per-feature test stats + playground deep-link
- #1334 Spec compliance audit: architect-s51 reviewed all ECMAScript sections, filed 17 targeted spec-gap issues + 7 IR retirement tasks → becomes sprint 51 backbone
- #1343 Boolean/Symbol coercion TypeErrors, #1344 Date formatters, #1347 for-of IteratorClose
- Timeout raised 8s → 30s: eliminates ~36 false compile_timeout regressions per PR

**Infrastructure wins**:
- Per-test compile timeout increased from 8s to 30s (eliminates false CI noise)
- `sprint/50` tag pushed; `sprint-51/begin` tag pushed

**Carry-overs** (blocked or regressions):
- #1311 (PR #264 -5 net), #1312 (PR #257 38 real regressions — function-index shift bug), #1324, #1325, #1326 (CI failures)
- Structural issue #1382 filed: Wasm closures not JS-callable from host (blocks #1338, #1339, #1358)

**Sprint 51 begins**: 25 issues, theme = spec-completeness wave + IR retirement gate. Target: +1,500–1,800 net passes.

## Sprint 61 (2026-06-05 → 2026-06-12) — npm-library support + architecture hardening

Began at 30,585 / 43,135 test262 passes (70.9%); closed at 31,267 / 43,135
(72.5%), **+682 net** over the cycle. 91 issues done (0 wont-fix), 84 carried to
sprint 62.

**Key work landed**:
- AnyValue host-bridge cluster (#2063 → #2058 → #2059): per-site externref tag
  dispatch (`__host_eq`/`__host_add`/`__host_compare`) — the −788 comparator
  trap structurally avoided.
- ~45 deep-audit fixes (optional chaining, spread, switch, block scope,
  for-of/for-in, regex VM opcodes, native strings, linear backend, IR reordering,
  fmod/hypot/isStaticNaN).
- Object-literal cluster #2126–#2132; presence-predicate joint spec (#2130+#1991,
  PR #1394).
- Pipeline hardening: 4 queue-rot mechanisms fixed (PR #1408) + baseline-meta SHA
  fix (PR #1413).
- Two architect specs (optional-chain undefined repr PR #1393; presence predicate
  PR #1394), adversarially reviewed.

**Infrastructure / process**:
- Symphony takeover: claims released, acorn gate #1712 blocker landed.
- Wrap-up debt flagged: sprints 55–60 lacked formal closure; sprint 61 closed
  retroactively 2026-06-15 with full wrap_checklist, retro, and this entry.

**Sprint 62 begins**: "Fable architecture sprint" — clean/maintainable/trustworthy/
consistent compiler architecture (one pipeline driver, one coercion engine, value-rep
doctrine, IR verifier, backend symmetry). Flat test262 headline accepted by design;
conformance payoff lands in sprint 63.
