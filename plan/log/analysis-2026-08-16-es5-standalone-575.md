# ES5 standalone — the 575 nonpasses (2026-08-16 census)

**Provenance**: CI baseline `test262-standalone-current.jsonl` fetched fresh
2026-08-16 (48,735 entries, loopdive/js2wasm-baselines main). Corpus pinned at
`b363f29d3c43` (matches the es5 goal doc). Classifier:
`scripts/generate-editions.ts` `classifyEdition` (post-#3626 window fix).
Pass definition: host-free (a `pass` with `host_import_leak_class` set is NOT
a pass). Population: the ES5 edition bucket, denominator **9,029**.

**Standalone ES5: 8,454 pass / 575 nonpass (93.6 %).**
The ≤ES3 legacy residue bucket (273 files) is 273/273 in standalone — no work.
The "Unclassified (untagged)" bucket (5,445 files, all carrying `esid:`) is a
different population and NOT part of this goal's denominator (see
`reference_goal_scope_is_not_the_landing_page_es5_bucket`).

**Method**: each nonpass row assigned to exactly ONE cluster by path+signature
rules (first match wins; rules in `.tmp/es5-standalone/report.mjs`). Cluster
sizes are routing labels, not shared-mechanism claims — signature counts inside
each cluster are the floor, the cluster size is the ceiling (#3626 §2.1 method).

## language-misc sub-triage (110 → mechanisms)

First-match path split with dominant signature per bucket (files in the
language-misc list above):

| sub-bucket | n | dominant mechanism hypothesis |
|---|---|---|
| types/object + expressions/in | 15 | `in` operator on plain `{}` (prototype-chain membership, `"valueOf" in __obj` false) |
| expressions/assignment | 10 | compound assignment + descriptor interplay |
| equals/does-not-equals/relational/addition/less-than… | ~12 | ToPrimitive (valueOf/toString) on objects in binary operators; function-to-string in `f1 + ""` |
| expressions/instanceof | 7 | `[[HasInstance]]` on non-Function / Function objects |
| property-accessors + call | 11 | member access on undefined/null must throw TypeError (not Test262Error path); `undefined.toString()` |
| arguments-object | 7 | `callee` own property, strict descriptor, arguments existence in nested scopes |
| statements/variable | 5 | function-vs-var binding shadowing (`__func === undefined`) |
| do-while/while/return/switch | ~11 | completion values / evaluation order (`__evaluated`) |
| prefix/postfix ++/-- + types/reference | ~10 | ReferenceError on unresolvable reference; ToNumber ordering |
| statements/try | 3 | property access on null in catch paths |
| misc singletons | ~19 | individually diffuse |

These are hypotheses from signatures — verify per-file before sizing (the #3626
method warnings apply: signature = where the test stopped, not which defect).

## Coverage map (2026-08-16 sweep vs issue inventory + claim ledger)

Live claims (2026-08-15, DO NOT DISPATCH): `ttraenkler/claude-es5-standalone`
holds #4465/#4479/#4483/#4484/#4485 (String generic-methods, plain-object
descriptor attrs, Function residual, instanceof, builtin-surface smalls);
`claude/es5-team-with` holds #4206 (with). Reserved-only (id taken, nobody
working): #4491, #4492, #4500.

| cluster | owner issue(s) | dispatchable now |
|---|---|---|
| with-statement (44) | #4206 (live claim), #671, #4231 | route around |
| defineProperty-family (86) | #4479 (live), #4491 (reserved), **#2668 (unclaimed)**, #3475 (stale) | #2668 |
| array-prototype (60) | fragmented: #4119 (stale), #4492 (reserved), #4366/#3531 (near-dups), #4160, #2036, #3446 (array-too-large) | consolidate first — no owner |
| function-prototype (57) | #4483 (live), #4043, #3544 (stale), #4196 (stale), #4265; substrate: **#1888 (unclaimed)** | #1888 substrate; avoid #4483's ~30-file bucket |
| string-prototype (43) | #4465 (live), **#4056 (unclaimed)**, #4095 (easy/S, unclaimed), #4005 | #4056/#4095 with care vs #4465 |
| annexB-b33 (8) | #2552/#2200 (June claims, stale; #2552 carries a −1180 regression warning — re-ground before touching) | cautious |
| toString/valueOf standalone (≈18) | Number: **#3175 (unclaimed)**; Object: #4119; String: **#3524 (re-scoped today)** | #3175, #3524 |
| scope-chain (27) | #4206 + #4232 (folded into with/10.4.3 lanes) | route around |
| harness-files (11) | #4251 (standalone cohort, in-progress) — asyncHelpers + verifyProperty-restore-accessor added to its scope via #4516 note | extend #4251 |
| annexB date/escape/unescape (10) | #4485 §C (live) owns getYear/setYear; escape/unescape had NO open issue → #4516 | #4516 (escape/unescape only) |

Duplicates cleaned this pass: #4168 → wont-fix (≡ #4025, done);
#4171 → wont-fix (≡ #4021). Both edits in this PR.

## Banked slice (measured 2026-08-16, opus-es5-b) — NOT mission-metric work

The `'Array.prototype.<m>' is not yet callable as a value in --target
standalone` class is **133 rows corpus-wide, 0 of them in the ES5 bucket**
(edition split: 2015:5, 2016:8, 2019:4, 2020:1, 2022:29, 2023:18,
untagged(-3):68). One refusal site: `src/codegen/array-object-proto.ts:791`
(`emitArrayProtoMemberBody`). The substrate to fix it already exists —
`hof-native.ts`'s `__extern_length`/`__extern_get_idx` array-like loop
pattern plus the `memberParamSlots` hook in `native-proto.ts` (optional
trailing-arg ABI). Clean first slice: pure-read members indexOf(12)/
lastIndexOf(13)/includes(3)/join(4)/at(2)/toString(1) = 35 rows. Belongs to
an ES2015+/untagged-scoped lane under #1888's umbrella; deliberately NOT
picked up by the ES5-standalone team.

Instrument note for this container: the QuickJS eval provider cannot be
built here (no clang-18/cmake, no prebuilt artifact) — the runner fails
LOUDLY ("provider is not built"), so eval-shaped rows are identifiable and
must be excluded from local measurements, never counted as failures. Under
load, local standalone compiles run 30–120 s/file and can hit the compile
timeout where CI's baseline shows a clean runtime error — trust the baseline
for the error class and say so.
