# Issue Dependency Graph

Issues organized by dependency order -- work items at the top are ready now,
items below unlock when their dependencies complete. No sprint batching needed:
pick any "ready" item and start.

## Sprint 65 landings (2026-06-23 session — value-rep substrate spine)

> **Sprint 65 CLOSED 2026-06-24** (user-approved): 58 done, 34 carried to s66
> (reassigned `sprint: 65 → 66`) + #2637 pulled from backlog. The parent epics
> below now carry on s66 — see [`plan/issues/sprints/66.md`](../issues/sprints/66.md).

This session's merged architecture slices (all 0-regr vs the `merge_group`
standalone floor #2097 + per-process test262 floor). These advance — but do
not close — their parent epics; the parent issues stay carried.

| PR | Issue / parent epic | What landed |
|----|---------------------|-------------|
| #1975 | #2580 M3 Stage A (value-rep) | standalone inline-literal `[[Prototype]]` link — `Object.create({...}).foo` resolves |
| #1977 | #2623 → Promise epic (#1042/#2614) | class-extends-Promise value-read identity unified w/ capability ctor (+1 row) |
| #1981 | #2623-A → async epic (#1042) | single-box nested capture of an already-boxed var (`alreadyBoxed`); fixes `illegal cast in Constructor()` |
| #1984 | #2618 Slice 1 → Proxy epic (#1355) | Proxy START-timing bridge + callable-target wrap; apply/construct 14→15 (+1) |
| #1986 *(open, BLOCKED)* | #2580 M3 B-pre | re-resolve `__is_truthy` funcidx after callback compile (some/every/filter invalid-Wasm) |

Docs/staging this session: #1973 (M3-A spec mis-attributed → DEFER), #1976/#1979
(M3 Stage B scoping + cluster-composition re-ground), #1974 (#2618/#2623-C Slice
C → CONFIRM DEFER, #56-zone). The corrected M3 sequence is **accessor cluster
(`Object.defineProperty`, 181/266 files) first → functor `.prototype=` lap
(51 files, escape-analysis-gated, #1888-eject risk) last** — not a row-count lap.

## Sprint 57 — acorn dogfood + backend-agnostic IR (added 2026-05-29)

Architectural sprint. Two tracks; conformance guard is zero-regression.

**Track 1 — self-hosting-dogfood** (compile + run acorn correctly):

| #     | Title | Priority | Feasibility | Status | Depends on |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| 1710  | acorn dogfood harness (compile + validate + diff-AST vs node-acorn) | high | medium | Done (s57) | — |
| 1711  | triage harness surface → file sized child issues | high | medium | Done (s57) | #1710 |
| 1712  | acceptance: compiled acorn AST == node-acorn on a representative .js | high | hard | Carried to sprint 58 (unblocked by #1745) | #1710, #1711 |

Prior acorn blockers #1679 / #1690 / #1690b are **done** (regression-guarded by #1710).

**Track 2 — backend-agnostic-ir** (decouple IR from WasmGC):

| #     | Title | Priority | Feasibility | Status | Depends on |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| 1713  | BackendEmitter trait: audit WasmGC bias + seam + WasmGcEmitter | high | hard | Ready — **needs architect spec first** | — |
| 1714  | lower one IR node kind to BOTH WasmGC + linear via the trait | high | hard | Backlog→ready after #1713 | #1713 (**arch spec**) |
| 1715  | minimal bytecode emitter + dispatch loop for an IR subset (proof) | medium | hard | Backlog→ready after #1713 | #1713 (**arch spec**) |

Feeds #1584 (in-Wasm bytecode interpreter) — gated on both tracks + #1712.

## Sprint 50 Extension (added 2026-05-07)

Pulled into S50 alongside the original closure/dispatch cohort. Direct-dispatch items have no architect dependency; spec items wait on architect.

| #   | Title | Priority | Feasibility | Status | Type |
|-----|-------|----------|-------------|--------|------|
| 1267 | Optimizer drops side-effectful method calls in stmt position | high | medium | Sprint 50 | Direct dispatch |
| 859 | Map.forEach callback captures are immutable snapshots | high | medium | Sprint 50 | Direct dispatch |
| 1268 | obj[key] ??= value returns NaN on index-signature types | medium | medium | Sprint 50 | Direct dispatch |
| 1020 | await-using TDZ tests null_deref crash in assert_throwsAsync | medium | medium | Sprint 50 | Direct dispatch |
| 1155 | test262 worker classifies WebAssembly.Exception as compile_error | medium | easy | Sprint 50 | Direct dispatch (quick win) |
| 837 | Map/WeakMap upsert getOrInsert/getOrInsertComputed | low | easy | Sprint 50 | Direct dispatch (stretch) |
| 1239 | Object literals with get/set accessors → JS host object | medium | hard | Sprint 50 | **Needs architect spec** |
| 1158 | destructureParamArray fallback eagerly consumes iterators | medium | hard | Sprint 50 | **Needs architect spec (bundle with #1159)** |
| 1159 | Nested empty array pattern with initializer iterator semantics | medium | hard | Sprint 50 | **Needs architect spec (bundle with #1158)** |

## Legend

- **Ready** -- no blockers, can start immediately
- **Blocked by #N** -- requires #N to be done first
- **Coordinates with #N** -- touches same code, should not run in parallel
- File icons show which codegen file is primarily touched:
  `[E]` = expressions.ts, `[S]` = statements.ts, `[I]` = index.ts, `[T]` = test262-runner.ts

## Destructuring-lane sweep follow-ups (added 2026-05-24)

From the dev-1553b destructuring-lane verification sweep. #1659 (CI equivalence
coverage) gates #1658 in the sense that #1658 is only CI-visible once #1659 lands.

| #    | Title | Priority | Feasibility | Status |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1659 | CI does not run tests/equivalence/ (OOM) — equivalence regressions land silently | high | medium | **Ready** (gates CI-visibility of #1658) |
| 1658 | Destructured/scalar function-parameter default not applied (returns 30, expects 40) | high | medium | **Ready** (depends on #1659 for CI gating) |

## Sprint 55 — docs (added 2026-05-25)

| #    | Title | Priority | Feasibility | Status |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1661 | README programmatic-API example fails — `instantiate(binary, {})` vs default-mode host imports (guest #601) | high | easy | **Ready** (sprint 55, docs, plan-only) |
| 1667 | DX: `compile()` returns a ready-to-pass import object for default/JS-host mode (guest #601) | medium | medium | **Ready** (Backlog, feature). Complements #1661 — adds the JS-host convenience; standalone stays the recommended default |

## WASI Native Messaging — AssemblyScript-reference alignment (added 2026-05-24)

Compiler gaps blocking full convergence of `examples/native-messaging/host.ts`
(#1530) on the AssemblyScript reference `nm_assemblyscript.ts`.

**Direction (2026-05-24):** host capabilities are exposed as **standard Node.js
APIs** (`process.stdin` / `process.stdout`), never bespoke builtins. The
example is being rewritten onto `process.stdin.read()` (#1653) + already-shipped
`process.stdout.write()` (#1651), with `Buffer`/`DataView` framing.

| #    | Title | Priority | Feasibility | Status |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1654 | DataView/ArrayBuffer-backed TypedArrays emit an invalid wasm module under --target wasi | high | medium | **Ready** (root) |
| 1653 | process.stdin.read(buffer, offset?) — binary incremental stdin read (keystone) | high | hard | Blocked by #1654 |
| 1655 | process.stdout.write(ArrayBuffer) — accept ArrayBuffer arg, not only Uint8Array literal | medium | easy | Blocked by #1654 |
| 1530 | Native Messaging host example — Node-style rewrite (no bespoke builtins) | medium | medium | **Reopened** (`in-progress`); Blocked by #1653 + #1654 |
| ~~1628~~ | ~~raw-byte stdout builtin `writeStdout(bytes)`~~ | — | — | **wont-fix** — superseded by `process.stdout.write` (#1651), the standard Node API; bespoke builtin is the wrong shape |

```
#1651 (process.stdout.write) -- DONE (standard Node write API; supersedes #1628/#1617)
#1654 (ArrayBuffer/DataView valid standalone) -- root, unblocks both
  ├── #1653 (binary stdin read, process.stdin.read) -- keystone
  │     └── #1530 (Native Messaging example, Node-style rewrite) -- also needs #1654 directly
  └── #1655 (stdout write ArrayBuffer)

#1530 depends on #1653 + #1654.
#1628 (a.k.a. "#1617" in the #1530 history) -> wont-fix (superseded by #1651).
```

## Governance / legal — CLA gate (added 2026-05-24)

Gates merges of **external** PRs (including guest271314's PR #589, which is
attached to #1530). The current `cla-check` workflow is a no-op placeholder that
records no acceptance, so external contributions land with no auditable CLA
sign-off.

| #    | Title | Priority | Feasibility | Status |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1660 | Replace placeholder cla-check with a real CLA signature/approval gate | high | medium | **Done** — self-hosted in-repo signature gate (`.github/cla/`); internal/bot authors exempt, external humans sign by comment. Promotion to a *required* check deferred to an admin (see issue follow-up). |

```
#1660 (real CLA gate) -- DONE: gates external-PR merges once promoted to required
  └── PR #589 (guest271314, attached to #1530) -- HOLD until guest's CLA acceptance is recorded
```

## Sprint 55 — repo structure / website (added 2026-05-24)

| #    | Title | Priority | Feasibility | Status |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1656 | Consolidate all website/frontend files under website/ | medium | medium | **Ready — specced** (`## Implementation Plan` in issue file). Dev-claimable; one PR. NOTE: site config is `playground/vite.config.ts` (NOT root `vite.config.ts` = library build); wide `..`→repo-root fan-out in playground plugins + scripts. `deploy-pages.yml` edit needs CODEOWNERS review. Related: #1583, #1590 |
| 1657 | Skip merge_group test262 shards for non-src changes (keep required check green) | medium | medium | **In review** — `changes` job + conservative path detector gates the merge_group shard matrix; "merge shard reports" always green. Related: #1656 |

## Cluster N: Codegen Performance (WAT pattern elimination) `[E][S]`

Discovered via `scripts/analyze-wat-patterns.ts` (#948) — corpus of 3,619 modules.
All independent, can run in parallel.

| #   | Title | Impact | Ready? |
|-----|-------|--------|--------|
| 954 | Eliminate duplicate locals (57% modules, 3,366 extra locals) | Size/perf | **Ready** |

| 958 | Batch string concat chains into multi-arg call (4.8%, 531 chains) | GC allocs | **Ready** (hard) |

### String-hash warm-perf levers (carved from #1746 umbrella, 2026-05-31)

Native differential (PR #997) found the string **build** loop, not the hash loop, is
~99% of warm wall time (the i32 hash path #1746 lever #1 is DONE and already ~3.8×
faster/char than V8). The two remaining levers are now sized, dispatchable issues:

| #    | Title | Impact | Ready? | Deps |
|------|-------|--------|--------|------|
| 1761 | Presize string-build buffer from static loop trip count (kill reallocs + per-append cap-check) | Warm perf — top AOT win | **Ready** (medium) | — (related #1746, #1580, #1744) |
| 1762 | Linear-memory string backing for build/hash hot path — drop the WasmGC `(array i16)` GC barrier | Warm perf — strategic ceiling | **Ready, likely needs arch spec** (hard) | — (related #1746, #679, #682, #1714) |

#1746 stays the umbrella tracking issue.

#682 (RegExp standalone) ──→ #1105 Tier 2 string methods (match, replace, search)
#1101 (WeakRef) ──→ #1103 WeakMap/WeakSet (strong-ref fallback available without #1101)
#1666 (invalid-wasm cluster) ──→ #1664 (residual object/extern leaks), #1665 (native generators)
#1662 (audit) -- empirical --target wasi host-import map; spawned #1663–#1666

## 2026-06-25 — Sprint-66 ES3/ES5/ES6 edition-gap clusters (PO grooming)

Edition-gap issues with their sub-dependencies (umbrella → concrete slices):

- **≤ES3 (top priority, base language)**
  - #2666 member-ref `base[prop]` eval order (compound-assign + ++/--) — standalone.
  - #2667 mapped-arguments non-config/delete — residual of #1511 (done).
- **ES5 (largest: descriptor fidelity)**
  - #2668 Object.defineProperty/defineProperties fidelity — residual of #1460/#1462/#929 (done); JSON reviver (#2671) sequences AFTER this.
- **ES2015 (largest clusters)**
  - #2669 destructuring umbrella → slices #1642 (IteratorClose), #2566 (generator over-consume), #1556 (param struct mismatch). Prior: #1454/#2203/#2032/#796/#2587 (done).
  - #2670 Array.prototype generic-receiver/holes/length → coordinates with #2580 (length on dynamic receiver, in-progress). Residual of #2177/#2151/#473 (done).
  - #2671 Date/RegExp/Promise/JSON/super tracker → reopen-or-child #1343/#1440 (Date), #1444/#1439 (RegExp), #1465/#1368 (Promise), #1551 (super eval order). JSON deps #2668.
