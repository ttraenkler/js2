# Sprint 3: Eliminate remaining runtime failures and reduce compile errors by ~1500

## Sprint Goal

Fix all 62 remaining test262 runtime failures (achieving ~100% pass rate on compilable tests) and reduce compile errors from 3,465 to ~2,000, moving from 1,413 passing to ~2,500+ passing tests.

## Current Baseline (post Sprint 2, 2026-03-11)

- **Pass: 1,413** | **Fail: 62** | **Compile Error: 3,465** | **Skip: 15,873**
- Pass rate of compilable tests: 95.8% (1,413 / 1,475)
- Pass rate of all non-skipped: 28.6% (1,413 / 4,940)
- Total test files: 20,813

## Sprint 2 Results

Sprint 2 delivered 18 issues across 12 merged PRs:
- Runtime failures reduced from 167 to 62 (63% reduction)
- Compile errors reduced from 5,700 to 3,465 (39% reduction)
- Passing tests increased from 1,509 to 1,413 (slight decrease due to rebalancing from skip filter changes and re-measurement)
- 170/170 equivalence tests pass

## Expected Impact

| Metric | Before | After (estimated) |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------ |
| Pass | 1,413 | ~2,500+ |
| Fail | 62 | ~0 |
| Compile Error | 3,465 | ~2,000 |
| Skip | 15,873 | ~15,800 |
| Pass rate (compilable) | 95.8% | ~100% |
| Pass rate (all non-skip) | 28.6% | ~50% |

## Complexity Breakdown

- **XS (< 50 lines)**: 3 issues (#231, #240, #255)
- **S (< 150 lines)**: 16 issues
- **M (< 400 lines)**: 11 issues
- **L (> 400 lines)**: 2 issues (#232, #234)

Estimated total effort: ~2-3 weeks with 6-8 developers working in parallel worktrees.

## Risks and Blockers

1. **Unsupported call expression (#232)** is the largest single issue (1465 CE). Sprint 3 targets Phase 1 only (~200 fixes), focused on valueOf/toString method calls. Full resolution will span multiple sprints.
2. **ClassDeclaration (#234)** has 681 errors but many combine with other errors. The standalone cases should be tractable but the combined cases will only be fixed when all contributing errors are resolved.
3. **allowJs type flexibility (#236)** touches type coercion broadly -- care needed to avoid regressions in typed code paths.
4. **Yield in modules (#241)** may require changes to the test wrapper approach, which could affect all test results.
5. **Member expression skip (#231)** is a band-aid (moves tests to skip, not pass). These ultimately need Shape Inference Phase 4 (#130) for a real fix.

## Not in Sprint (deferred to backlog)

| # | Title | Reason |
| - | ----- | ------ |
| [130](issues/130.md) | Shape inference Phase 4 -- hashmap fallback | Too large, foundational |
| [146](issues/146.md) | Unknown identifier/scope (~684 CE overlap with #233) | Large, #233 handles subset |
| [149](issues/149.md) | Unsupported call expression (full, ~1465 CE) | #232 Phase 1 only in Sprint 3 |
| [153](issues/153.md) | Iterator protocol for destructuring | Depends on Symbol.iterator |
