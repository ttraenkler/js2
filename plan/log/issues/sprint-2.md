# Sprint 2: Eliminate remaining runtime failures and reduce compile errors

## Sprint Goal

Fix all 167 remaining test262 runtime failures (achieving ~100% pass rate on compilable tests) and reduce compile errors by ~500+, moving from 1,509 passing to ~2,000+ passing tests.

## Current Baseline (from test262-results.jsonl, 2026-03-11)

- **Pass: 1,509** | **Fail: 167** | **Compile Error: 5,700** | **Skip: 13,437**
- Pass rate of compilable tests: 90.0% (1,509 / 1,676)
- Pass rate of all non-skipped: 20.4%
- Total test files: 20,813

## Issue List

### Group A: Runtime failures (P0) -- 167 failures to zero

These tests compile and run but produce wrong results. Highest ROI since they are closest to passing.

**Subtotal: 3 issues**

## Total: 30 issues

## Developer Worktree Grouping

Issues grouped by code area to minimize merge conflicts:

1. **Unicode/property resolution** (1 dev): #214, #176 (property name decoding)
2. **Comparison/coercion** (1 dev): #208, #174 (comparison operators, BigInt)
3. **Object/class codegen** (1 dev): #212, #207, #140 (computed props, class runtime)
4. **Loop/control flow** (1 dev): #209, #213, #210 (for-loop, while, for-of)
5. **Function codegen** (1 dev): #211, #184, #177, #141 (function edge cases, arity, spread, templates)
6. **Binary emitter** (1 dev): #203, #178 -- separate from codegen, safe to parallelize
7. **Assignment/operators** (1 dev): #190, #195, #142 (destructuring, increment, assignment targets)
8. **Type coercion** (1 dev): #182, #183, #193, #185, #186, #175 (wasm type mismatches)
9. **Test infrastructure** (1 dev): #187, #191 (test262-runner.ts only, no codegen conflicts)
10. **Scope/error handling** (1 dev): #180, #196, #197 (var scope, try/catch, if)
11. **Built-in methods** (1 dev): #200, #205, #181 (JSON, indexOf, Object constructor)

## Expected Impact

| Metric | Before | After (estimated) |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------ |
| Pass | 1,509 | ~2,000+ |
| Fail | 167 | ~0 |
| Compile Error | 5,700 | ~5,200 |
| Skip | 13,437 | ~13,000 |
| Pass rate (compilable) | 90.0% | ~100% |
| Pass rate (all non-skip) | 20.4% | ~26% |

The primary goal is **100% pass rate on compilable tests** by fixing all 167 runtime failures. The secondary goal is reducing compile errors by ~500 so more tests become compilable.

## Complexity Breakdown

- **XS (< 50 lines)**: 2 issues
- **S (< 150 lines)**: 15 issues
- **M (< 400 lines)**: 10 issues
- **L (> 400 lines)**: 3 issues

Estimated total effort: ~2-3 weeks with 4-5 developers working in parallel worktrees.

## Risks and Blockers

1. **Unicode escape (#214)** is the single highest-impact fix (44 failures). It should be straightforward but touches property resolution which is pervasive.
2. **Comparison valueOf coercion (#208)** requires runtime dispatch to valueOf/toString methods on object operands. The coercion infrastructure from Sprint 1 (#126, #138, #139) may need extension.
3. **Assignment target patterns (#190)** is large (136 CE, L complexity). Consider splitting into array destructuring and object destructuring sub-PRs.
4. **Try/catch (#196)** has 40 CE but the catch variable typing interacts with allowJs mode -- may conflict with other type flexibility fixes.
5. **For-of destructuring (#210)** produces TypeErrors at runtime, suggesting a fundamental issue with how destructured iteration variables are handled.
