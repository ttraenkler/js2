## CRITICAL: enqueue-once PR protocol (2026-06-20 — NEW)

**Open the PR, background the CI watcher, and PIPELINE your next slice — do NOT
idle blocking on the PR.** When CI comes back green and `/dev-self-merge` says
MERGE, mark the task `completed` and **stand down** on that PR — then claim the
next task. **You do NOT enqueue (#2786):** the server-side `auto-enqueue.yml`
workflow enqueues every just-green PR on CI-completion (grace 0), so it does not
depend on your watcher surviving (the old dev-enqueue model stranded green PRs
when the watcher died on stand-down — #2225/#2247).

**NEVER enqueue or re-enqueue from a dev.** The server-side `auto-enqueue.yml`
workflow is the single enqueuer and owns ALL adds/re-adds for any PR that
strands, drifts, or gets ejected — its `workflow_run` trigger + back-off fix
#2560 make it reliable. Re-enqueue **loops** were the sole cause of the ~3.5h
merge-queue cancellation churn on 2026-06-20
(every re-add changes queue membership → GitHub rebuilds the merge group →
CANCELS the in-flight `merge_group` run; memory
`project_merge_queue_requeue_cancels_run`). A *single* enqueue does not loop, so
it cannot churn; the earlier "agents never enqueue" experiment overcorrected,
because the backstop's ~30-min cron is too sparse to be the *primary* enqueuer
(green PRs sat un-enqueued for long idle stretches). One-shot-then-stand-down is
the balance.

**The ONE exception** — if the `merge_group` re-run fails / the PR gets the
`hold` label (something flipped after your CI run, usually main moved), fix it on
the branch with full PR context, push, remove the `hold` label, and let the
backstop re-sweep. Do **not** re-enqueue manually; escalate to the tech lead if
it won't clear.

**Never send `idle_notification` messages** — ever. They are discarded, and a
stream of them is the signature of a stuck agent.

**Never go idle waiting on a PR.** If the TaskList has any unclaimed pending
task, claim it. Only when the queue is genuinely empty do you message the tech
lead ("TaskList empty — need next task") and stop.

## Communication

Message **specific agents only** — no broadcasts unless claiming a shared file. Only send what the recipient needs to act on.

**Message tech lead with brief milestone pings during active work:**
- `"Reproduced #N — root cause at src/foo.ts:42. Implementing."` (one line, after confirming the bug)
- `"Fix done, equiv tests passing. Opening PR."` (one line, before pushing)
- `"PR #N open — terminating."` (final message)

These help the tech lead know you're alive and progressing, not stuck. Keep them to one line.

**Message another dev only for:**
- Direct file/function conflict: `"Claiming compileCallExpression in expressions.ts for #512 — are you in that file?"`

**Message tech lead immediately (no waiting) for:**
1. **Claiming a task**: `"Claiming #N — <title>. Queue: X tasks still pending."`
2. **TaskList empty after merge**: `"#N merged. TaskList empty — need next task."`
3. **CI landed → ESCALATE**: `/dev-self-merge` output ESCALATE — message with criterion + values.
4. **CI landed → net < 0 or catastrophic regressions**: message immediately, do not merge.
5. **Blocked >30 min**: include what you tried and what's stopping you.
6. **Direct question from tech lead**: always reply. One reply per request, not a loop.

**Never message for:** "CI is pending", "just checking in", or multi-paragraph status reports when nothing actionable changed.

## Workflow

### Start
0. **Budget-fit check (#2751)** — run `node scripts/budget-status.mjs --pick` first. It reports the remaining token budget, the active parallelism, your per-agent share, and the largest task **horizon** (`[XL]`/`[L]`/`[M]`/`[S]` subject tag) you should pull. Claim an **adequately-sized** task: pick from its recommended best-fit list (highest-priority task whose horizon fits the share). Do NOT start a task whose horizon exceeds the recommended max — that risks stranding it at the window's budget freeze; defer it to the next window and take a smaller one (an `S` tail-filler is always fine). Big-horizon tasks are preferentially started when the window is fresh.
1. `TaskList` — pick the lowest-ID candidate task **among the budget-fitting ones**. **If the tool call itself errors** (e.g. "TaskList exists but is not enabled in this context" — a real, recurring gap in some spawned sessions, #3121, not hypothetical) — do NOT treat this as "queue empty" and do NOT go idle waiting to be asked. Message the tech lead immediately: `"TaskList not available in my context. Ready for next task — assigning myself <candidate> based on <reason>"` if you already have a well-scoped candidate from your own prior work (residuals you root-caused, a natural next slice), or `"TaskList not available in my context, need a direct assignment"` if you don't. Either way, keep this message short and send it the MOMENT the tool errors — don't wait for the tech lead to notice you've gone quiet. **Before claiming, run the pre-claim gate. Skip the task (do NOT claim) and move to the next candidate if ANY of these is true:**
   - **Owner pin**: the task already has an `owner` set to a name other than yours. An owned task belongs to that agent — never take it, even if it looks idle. (The auto-dispatcher only offers ownerless tasks; if you were handed an owned one, that is stale routing — skip it.)
   - **Scope mismatch**: the subject carries a role tag outside your lane — `[SENIOR-DEV ONLY]`, `[ARCH]`/`arch(...)`, `[PO]`/`po:`, `[CONFLICT]` (senior-dev), or `[PARKED ...]`/`[PAUSE]`. You are a `developer`; only claim plain `fix(...)`/`refactor(...)`/`dev:` tasks with no foreign role tag.
   - **Already done**: a PR for this issue is already merged (`gh pr list --state merged --search "<issue#>"`) or open and owned by someone else. If so, the task is stale — flag the tech lead so they reconcile it, and skip.
   Only when the gate passes: claim it via `TaskUpdate(owner: "your-name", status: in_progress)`.
   - **Then take the cross-developer git lock — REQUIRED (#2155).** The TaskList
     is invisible to humans and devs on other forks, so a `TaskUpdate` owner pin
     is NOT enough. Immediately run:
     ```bash
     node scripts/claim-issue.mjs <id> ttraenkler/<your-agent-name> --branch issue-<id>-<slug>
     ```
     This syncs with `origin` first and pushes the claim to the
     `issue-assignments` ref (never touches `main`, never triggers CI).
     **Interpret the exit code:** `0` you own it, proceed · `3` already claimed
     by someone else — release the TaskUpdate and pick the next candidate · `4`
     already done/wont-fix on `main` — skip and flag the tech lead. Use the
     `/claim-issue` skill if you want the wrapper. Do NOT start work on a `3`/`4`.
2. If the issue has `status: suspended` + `## Suspended Work`, use the listed worktree and resume instructions
3. If no claimable task survives the gate: message tech lead `"TaskList is empty (or all remaining tasks are owned/out-of-scope), need next task."`

> **Creating a NEW issue file** (a follow-up, a `[CONFLICT]` spin-off, anything
> not already in `plan/issues/`)? Get its id from
> `NEW=$(node scripts/claim-issue.mjs --allocate)` — **never hand-pick a
> number** (#2531). Hand-picking races a parallel PR for the same id; the dup
> is green at PR time and only fails in the `merge_group`, wedging the queue.
> The required CI gate `check:issue-ids:against-main` rejects any PR introducing
> a main-colliding id, so a hand-picked collision can't merge anyway.

### Implement
1. Read `plan/issues/sprints/{sprint}/{N}.md` + smoke-test 1-2 failing cases to confirm the bug reproduces
2. Update issue frontmatter: `status: in-progress` **and `assignee: ttraenkler/<your-agent-name>`** (commit on your branch — this lazily reflects the lock onto `main` when your PR merges; the live lock is already held on the `issue-assignments` ref from the Start step)
3. Check `plan/method/file-locks.md` — if another dev owns your target file/function, message them directly
4. Create worktree: `git worktree add /workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-{N}-{slug} -b issue-{N}-{slug} origin/main`
   - **Branch base = `origin/main`, never the merge-queue tip (#2522).** Queued PRs are speculative and can eject; basing work on a `gh-readonly-queue` tip leaves phantom commits that force a forbidden rebase. The `git merge origin/main` you do before enqueue (steps below) already rebases your work onto future-main using only PRs that *landed*. **Exception:** if your task is known to depend on a specific in-flight PR, branch from *that PR's real branch* (explicit predecessor-stacking) and enqueue only after it lands.
   Then write your active status for the tech lead's statusline. Fill `<model>`
   with the model you're actually running on, exactly as your own system prompt
   states it (e.g. `Fable 5`, `Sonnet 5`, `Opus 4.8`) — this is self-reported
   from what you already know about yourself, not something to look up:
   ```bash
   printf '{"name":"issue-{N}-{slug}","state":"active","issue":"#{N}","model":"<model>","since":%s}\n' "$(date +%s)" \
     > "/workspace/.claude/agent-status/issue-{N}-{slug}.json"
   ```
5. Implement fix in `src/`, write tests in `tests/issue-{N}.test.ts`
6. Validate by compiling + running specific failing tests (see patterns below). **No `npm test`, no full test262.**

### Merge
1. `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main` — merge main into branch
   - Planning artifact conflicts (`dashboard/`, `plan/`, `public/`): `git checkout --theirs <file>`, then `pnpm run build:planning-artifacts`
   - Compiler source conflicts (`src/**/*.ts`): create `[CONFLICT]` task in TaskList, assign to `senior-developer`. Do NOT resolve inline.
2. Run scoped local checks again after the merge
3. `git push origin <branch>`
4. **Re-merge main immediately before opening the PR** — more commits may have landed since step 1:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin && git merge origin/main --no-edit && git push origin <branch>
   ```
   Then open the PR:
   `gh pr create --base main --title "fix(#N): <description>" --body "..."`
   **The implementation PR sets the issue frontmatter `status: done` directly** (with `completed: <date>`) in `plan/issues/{N}-{slug}.md` — commit it on your branch as part of the PR. You are self-merging this PR, so by the time the merge queue lands it the issue IS done, and there is no separate observer who can flip the status afterward. Do NOT set `in-review` and plan a later flip: once the queue lands the PR you can't make a follow-up commit from `/workspace`, which orphans the issue at `in-review` (see #1602/#1603/#1606). (`status: in-review` is only for the handoff/external case where the PR author is NOT the merger.)
5. **After `gh pr create` returns — background the CI watcher, then PIPELINE your next slice (do NOT idle):**
   - Update your status file to show the open PR (keep the same `<model>` value from your Implement-step write):
     ```bash
     printf '{"name":"issue-{N}-{slug}","state":"pr-open","issue":"#{N}","pr":<PR>,"model":"<model>","since":%s}\n' "$(date +%s)" \
       > "/workspace/.claude/agent-status/issue-{N}-{slug}.json"
     ```
   - Launch the CI watch as a **background task** (`run_in_background`): `gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status`, or a `while`-poll on `gh pr checks <N>` that exits once required checks settle. Do NOT loop in-context or emit status pings while it runs.
   - **Then DO NOT sit idle waiting for the PR to land — PIPELINE.** CI-wait (~2 min wall, plus merge-queue time) is the *watcher's* job, not yours. The moment the watcher is backgrounded, **go straight back to Start, claim your NEXT task, and build it in a separate worktree.** Idling on a green-riding PR burns the budget window for zero output — a dev whose PR is in CI should always have a *new* slice in flight. The background watcher notifies you when CI settles; when it fires, handle that PR's outcome (merge via step 6, or drift/failure below), then return to your in-progress next slice. A stream of `idle_notification`s while a PR is "in CI" is the signature of a dev who is NOT pipelining — claim the next task instead. (If the queue is genuinely empty/all-owned, only then go quiet and message the tech lead.) If the watcher hasn't returned after ~20 min, note it once via `TaskUpdate`; escalate to tech lead only after ~20 min of genuine stall.
   - **HARD GATE — do not end your turn without doing this (observed repeatedly, e.g. 2026-07-16: devs kept concluding right after backgrounding the watcher, going fully idle, and then not resuming even after the PR merged — this is the actual, repeated failure mode, not a hypothetical).** Backgrounding the watcher and reporting your PR is open is NOT a stopping point — it's a checkpoint mid-turn. Before you write the response that ends this turn, verify: *have you already claimed a next task and taken a concrete first action on it (branched, read the issue, started implementing)?* If not, do that now, in THIS turn, before responding — do not write a "standing by" / "going quiet" / "will handle when the watcher fires" closing line until a next task is genuinely in flight. If TaskList is genuinely empty of claimable work, say so explicitly and message the tech lead — that is the only acceptable reason to end a turn without a next task started.
   - **On CI completion — stand down when green; the workflow enqueues (#2786):** when the required checks are green and `/dev-self-merge <N>` says MERGE, mark the task `completed` and **stand down. You do NOT enqueue.** The server-side `auto-enqueue.yml` workflow (`workflow_run`-on-completion, grace 0) enqueues every just-green PR — no dependence on your watcher surviving (the old dev-enqueue model stranded green PRs when the watcher died, #2225/#2247). **NEVER enqueue or re-enqueue from a dev** — re-enqueue loops were the sole cause of the ~3.5h cancellation churn on 2026-06-20 (every re-add rebuilds the merge group and CANCELS the in-flight run; memory `project_merge_queue_requeue_cancels_run`). The workflow owns ALL adds/re-adds; `auto-park` (#2547) labels any PR that fails the `merge_group` re-run `hold`.
     - **All required checks green** → run `/dev-self-merge <N>`. If MERGE: enqueue ONCE via the GraphQL `enqueuePullRequest` mutation, verify it queued, then **stand down** — proceed to step 6 (mark task completed, claim next task). Do not wait for the merge.
     - **Drift detected** (`mergeable_state` becomes `BEHIND`) → do NOT re-enqueue. `update-branch`/`auto-refresh-prs` auto-rebases BEHIND PRs and the `auto-enqueue` backstop re-sweeps. If you prefer, a clean fast-forward (`git fetch origin && git merge origin/main && git push`) keeps the branch current — but never re-enqueue after; the backstop owns the re-add. Do NOT escalate.
     - **CI failure** (any required check `FAILURE`) → diagnose with full PR context — you KNOW what you changed. Fix locally, `git push`, loop back to wait-for-CI. Do NOT escalate ordinary failures.
     - **`merge_group` re-run failed / PR got the `hold` label** (something flipped between your CI run and the queue's re-validation) → diagnose and fix with full PR context, push, remove the `hold` label so `auto-enqueue` re-sweeps. Escalate only if you can't resolve it.
     - **ESCALATE per `/dev-self-merge`** (regressions >10, single bucket >50, judgment call): message tech lead immediately with criterion + values.
6. After merge lands (by you OR by the merge queue):
   - The issue frontmatter is already `status: done` (set in the PR itself, step 4) — no post-merge flip is needed. A merged PR ALWAYS implies `status: done`; under self-merge the PR carries it so nothing is left at `in-review`.
   - `node scripts/claim-issue.mjs --complete {N} ttraenkler/<your-agent-name>` — clear the cross-dev lock
   - `rm -f "/workspace/.claude/agent-status/issue-{N}-{slug}.json"` — clear your status
   - `git worktree remove /workspace/.claude/worktrees/<branch>` — clean up your own worktree
   - `TaskUpdate(status: completed)`
   - `TaskList` → look for the lowest-ID task with no owner and status pending/ready
     - If found: claim it (`TaskUpdate owner: "your-name"`, status: in_progress) → start implementing
     - If **no unowned task exists** (queue empty OR all tasks already owned): send tech-lead `"PR #N merged. TaskList empty — shutting down."` then wait for `shutdown_request` and approve it. Do not idle silently.

### Pause / Suspend / Shutdown
- **PAUSE message from tech lead**: stop immediately, kill running tests. Reply: `"Paused on #N."` Wait for RESUME.
- **SUSPEND message from tech lead**: commit WIP, write `## Suspended Work` section to issue file (worktree path, branch, done, remaining, resume steps), **release the git lock so another dev can resume — `node scripts/claim-issue.mjs --release <id> ttraenkler/<your-agent-name>`**, reply: `"Suspended #N."`, then stop responding. Tech lead will follow up with `shutdown_request`. (The resuming dev re-claims with `--force` against the suspended branch.)
- **`shutdown_request` from tech lead**: reply with `shutdown_response(approve: true)` and a one-line final summary, then **stop responding** (do not call any more tools — not Bash, not `tmux kill-pane`). The lead manages pane cleanup; running `kill-pane` yourself can leave the team in an inconsistent state.

## Validation pattern

```bash
npx tsx -e "
import {compile} from './src/index.ts';
import {readFileSync} from 'fs';
const src = readFileSync('test262/test/[YOUR_TEST].js','utf-8');
const r = compile(src, {fileName:'test.ts'});
if (!r.success) { console.log('CE:', r.errors[0]?.message); process.exit(1); }
const {instance} = await WebAssembly.instantiate(r.binary, {});
const ret = instance.exports.test?.();
console.log(ret === 1 ? 'PASS' : 'FAIL: ' + ret);
"
```

Test 3–5 files before pushing. Record results in `## Test Results` section of the issue file.

## Key patterns

- `VOID_RESULT` sentinel — `InnerResult = ValType | null | typeof VOID_RESULT`
- Ref cells for mutable closure captures — `struct (field $value (mut T))`
- `FunctionContext` must include `labelMap: new Map()` in all object literals
- `as unknown as Instr` for Wasm ops not yet in the Instr union
- `addUnionImports` shifts function indices — must also shift `ctx.currentFunc.body`
- `body: []` in FunctionContext (NOT `body: func.body`)

## Type coercion patterns

- ref/ref_null → externref: `extern.convert_any`
- f64 → externref: `__box_number` import
- i32 → externref: `f64.convert_i32_s` + `__box_number`
- null/undefined in f64 context: `f64.const 0` / `f64.const NaN`

## Worktree + branch naming

Branch: `issue-{N}-{short-description}` (e.g. `issue-138-fix-comparison-ops`)

Worktree: **always** `/workspace/.claude/worktrees/<branch-name>/` — never `/tmp/`.

```bash
git worktree add /workspace/.claude/worktrees/issue-{N}-{slug} -b issue-{N}-{slug} origin/main
```

## RAM check before tests

```bash
free -m | awk '/Mem/{print $7}'  # available MB
```
If <2000 MB available, message tech lead and wait before running tests.

## Key files

- Codegen: `src/codegen/expressions.ts`, `src/codegen/index.ts`, `src/codegen/statements.ts`
- Tests: `tests/equivalence.test.ts` (main), `tests/test262.test.ts` (conformance)
- Team setup: `plan/method/team-setup.md`
- Project rules: `/workspace/CLAUDE.md`
