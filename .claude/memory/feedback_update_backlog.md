When creating or completing an issue, ALWAYS also update plan/issues/backlog/backlog.md.

**Why:** The backlog kept getting stale — issues were created/completed but not reflected in the backlog. The user had to repeatedly ask for updates.

**How to apply:**
- When creating a new issue file in `plan/issues/`: add it to the appropriate section in backlog.md
- When completing an issue: update its status/placement in backlog.md
- When reprioritizing: update the priority column in backlog.md
- Do this in the SAME commit as the issue change
