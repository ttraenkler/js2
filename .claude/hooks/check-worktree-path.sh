# PreToolUse hook: enforce worktree path convention.
#
# Worktrees MUST live under /workspace/.claude/worktrees/<branch-name>/ so
# they're visible to the tech-lead statusline and gitignored. Reject any
# `git worktree add <path>` whose target is outside that root.
#
# Allowed path roots:
#   - /workspace/.claude/worktrees/    ← canonical location
#   - /workspace/test262               ← legacy test262 sharded worktree
#
# Anything else (notably /tmp/worktrees/) is rejected with a hint.
#
# This hook only fires on `git worktree add` — `git worktree remove` /
# `list` / `move` / `prune` / `repair` are unaffected. The block is
# advisory: agents can still bypass it by cd'ing into a directory that
# the previous `cd` would resolve to, but the message + log entry give
# the user a chance to course-correct.

BLOCKED: git worktree add target "$ABS_PATH" is outside the canonical worktree root.

Convention: worktrees MUST live under ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-/workspace}/.claude/worktrees/<branch-name>/
so they're visible in the tech-lead statusline and covered by .gitignore.

Suggested fix:
  git worktree add "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-/workspace}"/.claude/worktrees/$(basename "$ABS_PATH") <branch-args...>

(See CLAUDE.md / team-lead memo on worktree convention.)
