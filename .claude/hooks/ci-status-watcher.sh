# FileChanged hook: watches .claude/ci-status/pr-*.json and injects a
# system reminder when a file matching the current dev's own PR is
# created or updated.
#
# Stdin: Claude Code FileChanged hook payload (JSON with .file_path).
# Output: JSON with hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext when the dev
# should react (PR finished and it's theirs); empty otherwise.
#
# How the dev "owns" a PR:
#   The hook reads `head_branch` from the ci-status JSON and compares it
#   to the session's current git branch (`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
#   in the hook's cwd, which is the agent's worktree). If they match, the
#   dev agent owns this PR and the reminder is injected.
#
#   In a multi-agent / single-token setup we cannot use `gh pr list
#   --author @me` here: every PR is GH-authored by the human running the
#   orchestrator, so `@me` would either match every PR (when run from the
#   orchestrator's session) or none (in dev sessions where the gh token
#   is shared but identity is still the human's). See #1193.
#
#   The orchestrator session (cwd is the main repo, branch `main` or
#   `master`) sees notifications for ALL PRs so the human-facing view is
#   unchanged; dev agents see only their own.
#
# Dev protocol on reacting:
#   - If conclusion=success and net_per_test is positive: no action needed,
#     the tech lead will merge. Safe to stay on current task.
#   - If conclusion=success but net_per_test is negative or regressions look
#     real: context-switch back to the PR and investigate.
#   - If conclusion=failure: context-switch back and fix.
#
# Note: `snapshot_delta` is an absolute pass-count diff vs the committed
# baseline file. It is NOT the merge gate (see #1082). The authoritative
# per-test metric is `net_per_test = improvements − regressions`.
