// (#2984 Phase 2) Standalone `<Builtin>.prototype.<member>` VALUE-read
// resolution policy — the subsystem module behind
// `tryCompileStandaloneBuiltinProtoMemberRead` (property-access.ts).
//
// A builtin-proto member value read resolves in three tiers:
//
//   1. OWN member (advertised in the receiver brand's glue CSV) — the
//      brand-keyed native-method/getter closure. Members whose native body is
//      not wired yet reify through the factory's `refusalBodyFallback`
//      (methods only): an identity-stable closure with spec `.name`/`.length`
//      whose INVOCATION throws a catchable TypeError (the #2193/#2651
//      degrade-to-catchable pattern). This is what makes the ES5 gOPD
//      identity assertion (`gOPD(Date.prototype, "getTime").value ===
//      Date.prototype.getTime`) hold — the #2885 Site-2 descriptor synthesis
//      (calls.ts) and this value read share one singleton per (brand, member).
//   2. INHERITED member — not own, but advertised by `Object.prototype`'s
//      glue. Every builtin prototype ultimately inherits Object.prototype's
//      methods, and the spec value of the inherited read IS the
//      Object.prototype member itself: `Function.prototype.valueOf ===
//      Object.prototype.valueOf` (Sputnik S15.3.4_A4). Resolve through the
//      OBJECT-brand singleton so both syntactic reads yield the same value.
//      NOTE: gOPD keeps own-property semantics — the Site-2 synthesis gates on
//      the receiver's OWN CSV and returns `undefined` for inherited members.
//   3. UNKNOWN member — `null`: the caller falls through to the dynamic path
//      (runtime `undefined`), never minting a phantom closure. (Pre-#2984 the
//      Array family could mint a throwing closure for an unknown member — the
//      `emitArrayProtoMemberBody` non-slice arm accepts any name — so the own-
//      CSV gate here also tightens that latent hole to spec `undefined`.)
//
// The reflective `.call(...)` route (`emitReflectiveNativeProtoClosureCall`,
// calls.ts) deliberately does NOT use this resolver: it relies on the
// factory's null return to fall through to its working legacy lowering
// (`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o, k)` — the propertyHelper.js
// idiom), and a throwing refusal body would regress it.
