 * (#4010 S3) Own-property **VISIBILITY** over the carrier bags — the four
 * reflective surfaces (`hasOwnProperty`/`Object.hasOwn`, `in`,
 * `getOwnPropertyDescriptor`, `Object.keys`/for-in/`getOwnPropertyNames`) made
 * able to see the own-property side table of a non-`$Object` receiver.
 *
 * ## Why this slice comes LAST, and what had to land first
 * #4010's ordering law:
 *
 * > Own-property VISIBILITY cannot ship before own-property DELETABILITY.
 *
 * That is a receipt, not a preference. #4055 v1 widened `__hasOwnProperty` /
 * `__object_hasOwn` to see the bag; every flip held, the PR was green, and the
 * `merge_group` parked it for **-684** host-free passes — 682 of the 713 losses
 * were `built-ins/**\/{name,length}.js`, 696 failing with *"descriptor should be
 * configurable"*. S2 (`carrier-bag-delete.ts`) made `delete` real on these
 * receivers, which removes the `configurable` wall; this module is the widening
 * that finally pays out against it.
 *
 * ## The -684 mechanism, isolated at last (it never was in #4055)
 * #4055's header records that three candidate mechanisms were measured and none
 * reproduced outside the full harness assembly. Measured here, standalone,
 * host-free, on current main:
 *
 * ```js
 * const f = Array.prototype.push;
 * f.name = "unlikelyValue";   // REFUSED by the read path (#2896 meta arm wins)
 * f.name;                     // => "push"      — looks correct
 * delete f.name;              // #2896 arm clears the meta bit
 * f.name;                     // => "unlikelyValue"   <- THE BAG KEPT IT
 * ```
 *
 * `__extern_set` had no builtin-fn arm, so a write to a **non-writable** builtin
 * `name`/`length` was silently deposited in the #3468 closure bag while the read
 * lane shadowed it. `propertyHelper.js` writes exactly that: `isWritable` does
 * `obj[name] = "unlikelyValue"` BEFORE `isConfigurable` does
 * `delete obj[name]; return !__hasOwnProperty(obj, name)`. Widen
 * `hasOwnProperty` over a bag polluted that way and `isConfigurable` answers
 * **false** for ~700 files whose descriptor is `configurable: true`. That is the
 * -684, exactly.
 *
 * The fix is at the SOURCE, not at the query: {@link buildBuiltinFnSetRefusalArm}
 * makes `__extern_set` refuse a key the #2896 metadata still owns — §10.1.9
 * OrdinarySet over an existing non-writable own data property is a no-op, so the
 * bag never sees the write. After `delete fn.name` the metadata is gone and an
 * assignment lands normally, which is also what the spec says.
 *
 * ## Composition — the helper answers FIRST, the bag only on a miss
 * Every wiring point preserves #4055 v2's pattern: the existing answer is
 * computed first and returned when it is affirmative; the bag is consulted
 * **only** where today's answer is "absent". So this can add a `true`, never
 * override one, and every receiver/key the old code answered for keeps its
 * answer bit-for-bit. The #2896 builtin-fn arms keep running first and
 * returning, so `{name,length}` on a builtin never reaches the bag.
 *
 * ## LOOKUP, never ENSURE
 * `__carrier_bag_of` uses the carrier-specific LOOKUP helper. A
 * *query* must never allocate a bag: merely asking whether a receiver has a
 * property would otherwise hand a later `__integrity_bag` consumer a carrier
 * that previously had none (the `carrier-bag-hasown.ts` rule).
 *
 * ## Tombstones come for free
 * `__obj_find`, `__obj_ordered` and `__obj_ordered_all` all skip
 * `FLAG_TOMBSTONE` entries, so a key deleted by S2 stays invisible to all four
 * surfaces. Nothing here re-implements delete semantics.
 *
 * ## What deliberately does NOT move
 * - **Date / RegExp** have no bag, so
 *   `__carrier_bag_of` answers null and every surface keeps its current answer.
 *   Native Error values now use their existing `$Error_struct.$props` slot;
 *   class-instance expandos use the identity-keyed instance substrate.
 * - **Builtin internals never leak into `keys`.** #4071 measured a -5 for
 *   letting closed-struct fields into `Object.keys` and reverted it. The bag is
 *   not a struct: it only ever holds keys a user assignment put there, so
 *   enumerating it cannot surface an internal field. The screen is structural,
 *   not a name-shape heuristic (#4086: `startsWith("__")` is NOT a safe screen).
 * - **`Object.defineProperty(fn, k, d)` still lands nowhere.** Widening gOPD
 *   does not make it lie: gOPD reads the same bag the define did not write, so
 *   an undefined descriptor stays undefined.
 * - **#4099's direction is the opposite one.** It is about `Object.keys`
 *   failing to EXCLUDE non-enumerables on `$Object` receivers; this includes
 *   bag entries, and honours `FLAG_ENUMERABLE` via `__obj_ordered` while
 *   `getOwnPropertyNames` uses `__obj_ordered_all`. Adjacent, not the same.
 *
 * ## Byte-neutrality
 * Reserved only when a carrier predicate exists (standalone/wasi — in gc/host
 * mode the `env::__extern_*` imports own the dynamic-property path), and every
 * placeholder body is the "nothing to add" answer, so a skipped fill degrades to
 * exactly today's behaviour instead of trapping.
