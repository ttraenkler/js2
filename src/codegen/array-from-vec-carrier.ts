/**
 * (#6422) Carrier admission for the `Array.from` array-copy fast path.
 *
 * That arm picks its `$Vec` from the CHECKER type (`resolveArrayInfo`), then
 * `local.set`s the compiled argument into a `ref null $Vec` local. A declared
 * or inferred `Uint8Array` resolves to a `$Vec` — but two real carriers behind
 * that same static type are NOT one:
 *
 *  * the shared-backing `$__ta_view` struct that `new Uint8Array(<ArrayBuffer>)`
 *    builds (#3054), in both lanes; and
 *  * a genuine host `Uint8Array` (EXTERNREF) — in the JS-host lane
 *    `hostTaBufferArgSymName` answers `"dynamic"` for an untyped buffer
 *    argument, so `emitHostTaBufferConstruct` constructs the real thing through
 *    `__construct_closure`.
 *
 * Storing either into that local is a validation mismatch, and
 * `repairStructTypeMismatches` silently repairs it with
 * `any.convert_extern; ref.cast_null $Vec` — a cast that TRAPS with
 * "illegal cast" at runtime for both, taking the whole module down.
 *
 * This module answers the one question the arm has to ask after it has
 * speculatively compiled its argument: does this value belong in that `$Vec`
 * local? A `$__ta_view` is admitted by DE-VIEWING it first (#3054 B1's
 * `emitTaViewToVec`, the same materialization the TypedArray prototype methods
 * take), which keeps the fast path AND the element values. A non-GC value
 * (externref, a scalar) is refused, and the caller rolls the probe back into
 * the native/host `Array.from` fallback rather than widening the cast.
 *
 * **It admits every OTHER WasmGC ref unchanged, on purpose.** The first cut
 * admitted only an exact `typeIdx === vecTypeIdx` match and refused the rest. A
 * GC struct whose index differs from the checker-derived vec is routinely
 * cast-compatible with it; the repair's `ref.cast` SUCCEEDS there and the
 * `array.copy` path was correct all along, so diverting those to the fallback
 * changed a working lowering for no reason. Only the two carriers that provably
 * TRAP are diverted or materialized; everything else keeps the pre-#6422
 * behaviour byte for byte.
 *
 * (The narrowing was prompted by a #2097 standalone high-water park on PR
 * #5894 — which turned out NOT to be this change: the same `pass=35567` was
 * reported for unrelated concurrent PRs, main-side drift. See the issue file's
 * Resolution for the correction. The narrowing was kept on its own merits.)
