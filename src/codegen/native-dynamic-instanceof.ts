 * (#2916 Slice B) The host-free substrate for the FULLY-DYNAMIC `instanceof`
 * right-hand side under `--target standalone` / `--target wasi`.
 *
 * ## The leak this closes
 *
 * `emitDynamicInstanceOf` (identifiers.ts) is the residual arm for an RHS whose
 * constructor identity is NOT knowable at compile time — an `any`-typed local, a
 * function-valued parameter, a property access, a call result, a comma
 * expression. Every static rule ahead of it (the #2998 primitive-LHS fold, the
 * #2916 non-callable-RHS throw, the builtin-alias rewrite, #3962's user-fnctor
 * arm, Slice A's builtin membership) declines there by construction, so the arm
 * fell through to `ensureLateImport(ctx, "__instanceof_check", …)` and emitted
 * `env::__instanceof_check`. A host-free binary cannot satisfy that import, so
 * the module does not instantiate and the #2961 leak guard refuses the test.
 *
 * **Scale, measured on the branch base rather than quoted from the baseline.**
 * The 2026-08-15 standalone baseline lists 59 files naming
 * `env::__instanceof_check` as their SOLE host import, and ~1,500 more naming it
 * alongside others. Both figures are STALE and neither should be quoted. Compiled
 * on current main: **20** of the 59 still emit it, and of a 150-file
 * deterministic sample of the ~1,500, **zero** do — earlier slices (#2998,
 * #3962, Slice A, #4276) resolve those sites statically now.
 *
 * So the live population is **20 files**, and this closes all of them. It is the
 * single import standing between ordinary `instanceof` code and a genuinely
 * host-free module — which is the deliverable. Conformance rows are the secondary
 * metric (see the issue's tiering); the measured yield is +3.
 *
 * ## What the runtime can actually decide, and what it cannot
 *
 * The helper is a DEFINED function, so every question it asks must be answerable
 * from the VALUE. Three classifiers already exist and are shared rather than
 * re-derived here (a second, silently-diverging copy is the hazard
 * `closure-classifier.ts` was created to end):
 *
 *  - `__typeof_function` — IsCallable. Finalize-corrected
 *    (`typeof-natives-finalize.ts`), so it sees EVERY closure root registered
 *    anywhere in the module plus the #4120 `OBJ_FLAG_CALLABLE`-branded builtin
 *    constructor carriers. Calling it instead of snapshotting
 *    `closureInfoByTypeIdx` at build time is what makes this helper immune to
 *    the order-dependence that #4276 documents for a membership list.
 *  - `__typeof_object` / `__typeof_undefined` — Type(V) is Object, and the
 *    `undefined` singleton (#2106 S1).
 *  - `__isPrototypeOf` — the §7.3.20 step 6/7 chain walk over `$Object.$proto`
 *    with `ref.eq` per level (object-runtime-prototype.ts). ONE walk, shared
 *    with #3962 and Slice C; no parallel `[[Prototype]]` mechanism.
 *  - The two tri-state identity probes below — the canonical `Object` carrier
 *    and `$NativeProto`'s `Object` brand. They answer only exact identities;
 *    an unknown probe leaves the ordinary conservative path untouched.
 *
 * ## The closure → prototype edge (#2660 M3) — and the remaining gap
 *
 * Until #2660 M3, `Get(C, "prototype")` was unanswerable for a **closure**: a
 * standalone function value is a WasmGC closure-wrapper struct, and its
 * prototype object lives in a module GLOBAL keyed by the COMPILE-TIME symbol
 * name (`fnctor-prototype.ts`, and `ctx.protoGlobals` for classes), with no
 * runtime edge from the value. So a closure RHS answered the conservative
 * `false` and the arbitrary runtime-`Function(...)` prototype cases remained
 * unresolved. The explicit `FACTORY.prototype = Object.prototype` join is a
 * separate, exact `$NativeProto` identity that the probes below can answer.
 *
 * Three arms close the modeled cases, in this precedence order:
 *
 * 1. **Own `prototype` on a NON-`$Object` callable.** The `ref.test $Object`
 *    branch below gained an `else`. `__hasOwnProperty`/`__extern_get` dispatch
 *    on the receiver kind themselves and route a closure into its own-property
 *    bag (#3468), where `F.prototype = v` actually lands — so the read is
 *    exactly as authoritative there as on a branded carrier. This is what lets
 *    `FACTORY.prototype = undefined` / `= "error"` on a `new Function` value
 *    reach the §7.3.20 step-5 TypeError (`S15.3.5.3_A2_T2` and `_A2_T6`,
 *    measured fail→pass) instead of the conservative `false`.
 * 2. **The identity edge**, `__closure_proto_of`
 *    (`closure-prototype-edge.ts`), consulted when NO own `prototype` exists —
 *    which is why the hasOwn miss now falls through instead of returning 0. It
 *    matches the value against the canonical singleton global for each user
 *    constructor / class by `ref.eq` and answers the SAME object the
 *    `[[Prototype]]` seeding uses, so a hit is the genuine `Get(C,"prototype")`
 *    and a miss is `null`. It is also consulted on the NOT-callable tail,
 *    because a CLASS value is `typeof "object"` in this backend (reason 2
 *    there) yet is callable per spec.
 * 3. **The canonical `Object.prototype` identity.** A runtime-created
 *    `Function()` can be joined to that native prototype by an own-property
 *    assignment. The Object-brand probe recognizes that exact value and
 *    answers the ordinary object-family membership without guessing about any
 *    other runtime-created prototype.
 *
 * The closure edge emits NOTHING when the module has no edges, and neither
 * identity arm can produce a wrong `true`: the closure edge is an exact
 * singleton match, the Object-brand arm is an exact native-proto brand match,
 * and the own-property arm reads a property the program itself wrote.
 *
 * ## The answers, and why each is the least-wrong one available
 *
 * The tri-state is the one `emitInstanceofThrowGuard` already consumes: 0 false,
 * 1 true, 2 throw a wasm-level TypeError.
 *
 * | RHS at runtime                                 | answer       | why                                                                                                       |
 * | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | `null` / `undefined`                           | 0            | host dynamic-path parity (`runtime.ts:2353`). This backend still lowers some `Function(a,b)` forms to null, and `primitive instanceof FACTORY` must stay `false`, not throw (`S15.3.5.3_A1_T1…T8`). |
 * | callable, OWNS a `prototype` property          | full §7.3.20 | an own-property read on a real `$Object` is authoritative: a present-but-non-object `prototype` is genuinely the program's state ⇒ 2, otherwise the chain walk decides. |
 * | callable, no modelled `prototype`              | 0            | **documented residual**, see below.                                                                        |
 * | anything else (incl. genuine primitives)       | 0            | there is no SOUND runtime primitive test in this backend — see the "no wrong throws" section.               |
 *
 * ### The residual, stated plainly
 *
 * `obj instanceof FACTORY` where `FACTORY` holds a runtime closure still
 * answers **`false`, not the spec's true/TypeError**, unless its own
 * `prototype` is a modelled value (including the exact `Object.prototype`
 * identity). `S15.3.5.3_A2_T2/T5/T6` (which want a TypeError for an arbitrary
 * non-object `F.prototype`) remain residuals; `_A3_T1` is the expected initial
 * false, while `_A3_T2` is closed by the Object-brand join. That is deliberate.
 * Both alternatives are WORSE: answering `2` asserts "F.prototype really is a
 * non-object", and answering `1` asserts membership — neither is known. A
 * missed conversion is a missed conversion; a wrong `true` passes a test
 * vacuously and a wrong throw is observable in a `catch`. Closing the remaining
 * cases needs a general runtime closure→prototype edge, not a guess in this
 * module.
 *
 * ### No wrong throws — the second thing this module measured and changed
 *
 * §13.10.2 steps 1/4 mandate a TypeError for a non-object / non-callable RHS,
 * and the first cut emitted one whenever the target was not classifiable as an
 * object. That is unsound HERE, because an unmodelled builtin constructor is
 * lowered to a boxed-primitive carrier: the shared classifiers answer
 * `typeof Int8Array === "boolean"` (probe-verified on this branch). So every
 * "is the target a primitive" predicate built on them mistakes a real
 * constructor for a primitive. Measured consequence:
 * `typedArray instanceof TypedArray` threw "Right-hand side of 'instanceof' is
 * not callable" where the host predicate answers `false`
 * (`built-ins/TypedArrayConstructors/ctors/object-arg/iterator-is-null-as-array-like.js`).
 *
 * Nothing PROVABLE was lost by dropping it: a statically-primitive RHS and a
 * provably non-callable object RHS both still throw at codegen, one dispatch
 * step earlier, where the evidence is the static TYPE rather than a runtime
 * representation the backend gets wrong.
 *
 * ## Why this cannot regress a passing test
 *
 * The arm runs ONLY under `noJsHost`, and ONLY where the code it replaces
 * emitted `env::__instanceof_check`. Under the authoritative measurement (the CI
 * worker / `scripts/test262-worker.mjs`, which applies `standaloneHostImportError`)
 * every reaching test is already a `compile_error`: a leaking module never
 * instantiates. So a native answer can only CONVERT such a test, never turn a
 * passing one into a failure. The JS-host lane never enters this module and is
 * byte-identical.
 *
 * NOTE for anyone re-measuring locally: `runTest262File`'s ORIGINAL-HARNESS lane
 * does NOT apply that guard, so a leaking module still runs there with the host
 * supplying the import. A local pass/fail on a leaking file is therefore an
 * upper bound on the host answer, NOT the lane CI scores.
 *
 * ## Index-space discipline
 *
 * The helper is minted with `mintDefinedFunc` (a STABLE handle — no shifter
 * touches it, `resolveLayout` resolves it once at emit) and pushed in the same
 * call, so its baked callee indices are walked by the late-import body shifter
 * like any other defined function. Nothing is minted at finalize (the #4221
 * hazard); the only finalize-time correction it depends on is a BODY rewrite of
 * `__typeof_function`, which changes no index at all.

 * are published by operand lowering, which runs AFTER the dynamic helper's body
 * is baked. The unfilled answer is `0` ("not proven to be the carrier"), which
 * keeps the helper's existing conservative path byte-for-byte.
 *
 * ## Why the helper needs it at all
 *
 * `%Function.prototype%` IS a function object (§20.2.3), but it is the one
 * callable this backend models as a `$NativeProto` carrier rather than as a
 * closure — so `__typeof_function` answers `false` for it and every §7.3.20
 * step past IsCallable was skipped: `V instanceof Function.prototype` came back
 * a silent `false`, whatever `Function.prototype.prototype` held.
 *
 * ## Why a probe here, not a widened classifier
 *
 * Teaching `__typeof_function` to answer `true` for the carrier would be
 * corpus-wide and a wrong `true` out of that classifier is observable
 * everywhere (`typeof`, every callable gate, every brand check). The probe is
 * an EXACT `$NativeProto` brand match consulted only on the helper's
 * not-callable tail, so no target the classifier already answers for changes
 * path.
 *
 * ## What the arm then does, and what was measured before writing it
 *
 * `__extern_get(C, "prototype")` is §7.3.20 step 5 in full on this carrier —
 * measured on this slice's base, it reads a data expando
 * (`Function.prototype.prototype = ""`) and it INVOKES an accessor installed by
 * `Object.defineProperty(Function.prototype, "prototype", {get})`. That
 * disproves the slice-I2 handoff's assumption that an accessor on a
 * `$NativeProto` carrier could not run ("the expando table stores values, not
 * attributes"); it holds for TypedArray carriers, not for this one. An ABSENT
 * `prototype` reads undefined, which `ordinaryHasInstanceTail` turns into the
 * spec's step-6 TypeError rather than a `false`.

 * (#6644) `Get(C, "prototype")` for an `instanceof` target the LINKED PROVIDER
 * owns — the last-resort arm of {@link ensureNativeDynamicInstanceOf}'s body.
 *
 * Every other ingredient of §7.3.20 already crossed the seam correctly.
 * Measured on the branch base with the real two-module fixture
 * (`.tmp/s66/probes/p3.mts`): `typeof T` is `"function"`, `T.prototype` reads
 * back the provider's own prototype object, `T.prototype.isPrototypeOf(V)` is
 * `true` (the #6622 class-instance seed composed with #6617's link hop), and
 * `Object.getPrototypeOf(V) === T.prototype` is `true`. The ONE step that
 * missed was the own-property GATE: `hasOwnProperty(T, "prototype")` answers
 * **false** for a provider-minted class object, because the consumer's
 * own-property bag is a module-local `ref.test` ladder that a foreign struct
 * matches nowhere. So the helper fell past both `prototype` arms to the
 * closure identity edge (module-local by construction), missed there too, and
 * answered the conservative `false` — for a DIRECTLY constructed provider
 * instance as much as for a subclass of one.
 *
 * The peer's `callableKind` is the ownership answer the gate needs: a value
 * with neither [[Call]] nor [[Construct]] over there is not a provider
 * function object, and this emits NOTHING at all in a module that consumes no
 * standalone provider. Bit 0 alone is not enough — a provider CLASS publishes
 * construct-only (`fillStandaloneLinkBoundaryLateTerminals`'s encoding), and a
 * class object is precisely the target every `x instanceof Temporal.Foo` names.
 *
 * `guardedTail` is §7.3.20 steps 3 + 5-7 for a `prototype` value already in
 * `L_PROTO`, passed in already-built so each call site owns a FRESH instruction
 * array (the index-finalization discipline every tail factory in this module
 * follows). Emitted LAST, after every local answer has declined, so it can only
 * replace a `false` that was a miss — never pre-empt an answer the consumer

/**
 * (#6651 I2) §13.10.2 InstanceofOperator steps 2-4 — the `@@hasInstance`
 * dispatch — as a WRAPPER around `__instanceof_dynamic`, not as an arm inside
 * it.
 *
 * ## Why a wrapper
 *
 * `__instanceof_dynamic` IS §7.3.20 OrdinaryHasInstance, and
 * `%Function.prototype%[@@hasInstance]` (`function-proto-has-instance.ts`) is
 * that abstract operation's public spelling — it calls the helper directly.
 * OrdinaryHasInstance must NEVER consult `@@hasInstance`; an arm inside the
 * helper would make `Function.prototype[Symbol.hasInstance].call(F, x)`
 * re-enter `F`'s own handler, which no step of the spec does. The handler
 * dispatch therefore belongs one level up, in the OPERATOR, and the ordinary
 * helper stays byte-identical for every existing caller.
 *
 * ## The steps, and what each one costs at runtime
 *
 *   2. `instOfHandler = GetMethod(C, @@hasInstance)` — `__extern_get` against
 *      the interned well-known `$Symbol` carrier `__box_symbol(2)`, the same
 *      identity a user's `F[Symbol.hasInstance] = …` write lands on. A
 *      THROWING accessor propagates: there is no catch here, which is exactly
 *      §13.10.2 step 3's `?` (`symbol-hasinstance-get-err.js`, which measured
 *      "Expected a Test262Error but got a TypeError" before this).
 *   4. `ToBoolean(Call(instOfHandler, C, «O»))` — the generic open-`any`
 *      bridge `__apply_closure(handler, C, argvec)` with a one-element
 *      `__objvec` holding `O`, then `__is_truthy`. That gives the handler the
 *      spec's `this` (`C`) and argument list (`«O»`, length 1) without a host
 *      import (`symbol-hasinstance-invocation.js`), and coerces whatever it
 *      returns (`symbol-hasinstance-to-boolean.js`).
 *
 * Everything else — a null/undefined handler (§13.10.2 step 4's "is not
 * undefined" is false, `GetMethod` having already mapped both to `undefined`),
 * and steps 5-6 — falls through to `__instanceof_dynamic` unchanged.
 *
 * ## Absent-not-wrong, twice
 *
 *  - A handler that is present but which `__typeof_function` cannot classify as
 *    callable falls through instead of throwing. The spec would throw (Call on
 *    a non-callable), but this backend's classifier is conservative about
 *    carrier shapes, so a wrong THROW would be catchable and observable while a
 *    fall-through is only a missed conversion. The statically provable
 *    non-callable spelling (`F[Symbol.hasInstance] = null`) never reaches here:
 *    `tryEmitNonCallableRhsThrow` answers it, and still does.
 *  - A `null` target skips the read entirely, so `__extern_get` is never handed
 *    a null receiver.
 *
 * ## Why this is not emitted everywhere
 *
 * The wrapper is built only for a source file that INSTALLS a possibly-callable
 * `@@hasInstance` (`moduleInstallsCallableHasInstance`). That is the same
 * module-scope question `tryEmitNonCallableRhsThrow` already asks, and it keeps
 * `__apply_closure` plus the argument-vector runtime out of every standalone
 * binary that merely uses `instanceof`. Residual, stated plainly: in a
 * MULTI-FILE compilation where the first dynamic `instanceof` site lives in a
 * file that does not install a handler and a later site lives in one that does,
 * the wrapper is minted once, from the first site, and the later site keeps the
 * ordinary helper. That is a missed conversion, never a wrong answer.
