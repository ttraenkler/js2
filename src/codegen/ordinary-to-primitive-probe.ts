/**
 * (#4492 wave-5) The RUNTIME §7.1.1.1 OrdinaryToPrimitive walk, as a reusable
 * instruction builder.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as one builder
 *
 * The standalone backend resolves `valueOf`/`toString` at COMPILE time wherever
 * it can — per-struct dispatchers (`__call_valueOf`/`__call_toString`), the
 * `tryStructToString` closure/method walk, the `funcSourceText` fold. Every one
 * of those is keyed by a struct type or a binding name, so none of them can see
 * a method that arrives on the PROTOTYPE at runtime (`Function.prototype
 * .toString = …`, `F.prototype.toString = …`) or on an object the compiler
 * cannot name. `__extern_get` can: it walks own slots and the whole prototype
 * chain, including the #4176 brand companion that a `<Ctor>.prototype.<m> = …`
 * write lands on.
 *
 * #4491's `emitAddOrdinaryToPrimitiveResidue` (add-to-primitive.ts) proved the
 * shape works, and deliberately scoped it to the `+` operator. That scoping is
 * why the SAME function rendered four different ways in one module (measured
 * 2026-08-23, `.tmp/probes/t6.js`: `"" + f` → `OWN_F_TS` while `String(f)` and
 * `` `${f}` `` → `[object Object]`). Rather than copy the residue a third and
 * fourth time, the walk lives here and the callers differ only in what they do
 * with a primitive result.
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * `buildOrdinaryToPrimitiveProbe` emits, for each method name in `order`:
 *
 *   m = __extern_get(recv, "<name>")
 *   if (m is present && IsCallable(m)) {
 *     r = __call_accessor_get(recv, m)          // the arity-0 call bridge
 *     if (r is a PRIMITIVE) { <onPrimitive>; }  // caller returns from here
 *   }
 *
 * and falls out of the emitted region when nothing produced a primitive, so the
 * caller keeps its existing fall-through byte-for-byte.
 *
 * **`null` is not an accepted primitive.** In standalone `undefined` and `null`
 * are the same null externref (`__typeof_undefined` is a bare `ref.is_null`,
 * object-runtime.ts), so a method returning either is indistinguishable here —
 * and the module already contains BOTH renderings of that one value
 * (`tryStructToString`'s `normaliseToString` says `"undefined"`,
 * `__any_to_string`'s #4621-D raw-null arm says `"null"`). Choosing one would
 * make this walk disagree with the other for a value it cannot tell apart, so
 * it declines and lets the caller's existing path answer (absent-not-wrong).
 *
 * `onPrimitive` is a FACTORY, not an array: the walk emits it once per method
 * name, and aliasing one `Instr[]` into two tree positions double-shifts the
 * `funcIdx` fields inside it when a post-codegen pass walks the tree (the #1448
 * corruption class).
