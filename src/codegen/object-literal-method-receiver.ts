/**
 * Receiver binding for a **call on an object-literal function-valued property**.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * ```js
 * var obj = { x: 42, m: function () { return this.x; } };
 * obj.m();            // undefined   (want 42)
 * obj.m.call(obj);    // 42          — already correct
 * ```
 *
 * This is ordinary, everyday JavaScript, and it was wrong on **both** lanes
 * (standalone AND gc/host) for every arity, for a nested receiver
 * (`outer.inner.m()`), and — worst — for a method that WRITES through `this`
 * (`this.x = 99` landed nowhere observable). The value read is right: extracting
 * the member first (`var g = obj.m; g.call(obj)`) has always worked.
 *
 * ## Root cause (measured on the emitted WAT, not inferred)
 *
 * `compileCallablePropertyCall` (`expressions/calls-closures.ts`) lowers
 * `obj.m()` to a `call_ref` whose **first argument is the CLOSURE ref** — the
 * lifted function's `self`/environment carrier — and threads nothing else. The
 * receiver is compiled only to read the field off it and is then unreachable.
 *
 * The callee half was already correct and needed no change. For
 * `m: function () { return this.x; }`, `bodyReferencesOwnThis` is true, so
 * `compileFunctionBody` sets `readsCurrentThis` and the lifted body opens with
 *
 * ```wat
 * global.get $__current_this ; local.tee ; ref.is_null
 * (if (result externref) (then <undefined>) (else <the receiver>))
 * ```
 *
 * i.e. it reads the global and falls back to `undefined` when nothing was
 * installed. Nothing on this path ever wrote that global. So — exactly as in
 * #4192, whose machinery this module reuses rather than re-derives — **only the
 * writer was missing**; `obj.m.call(obj)` works today precisely because
 * `__apply_closure` installs it.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * The receiver is captured (as externref) at the ONE point it is already
 * compiled, so it is evaluated exactly once — no re-compilation of
 * `propAccess.expression`, and therefore no risk of running a side-effecting or
 * getter-backed receiver twice. The install is emitted **after the arguments**,
 * immediately before the `call_ref`:
 *
 * ```wat
 * <receiver>  local.tee $tmp ; local.get $tmp ; extern.convert_any
 *             local.set  $__objm_recv          ;; captured once, with the field read
 * …           ;; self, arguments, funcref — unchanged
 * global.get  $__current_this ; local.set $__objm_prev
 * local.get   $__objm_recv    ; global.set $__current_this
 * call_ref                    ;; unchanged
 * [local.set  $res] ; local.get $__objm_prev ; global.set $__current_this ; [local.get $res]
 * ```
 *
 * **Argument order is load-bearing.** Installing before the arguments are
 * evaluated would corrupt an argument that reads the CALLER's `this`
 * (`obj.m(this.q)`), since that read also goes through `__current_this`. Every
 * arm therefore installs at the last possible moment.
 *
 * Save/install/restore is inline, matching `closure-receiver-install.ts`,
 * `__call_fn_method_N` (closure-exports.ts) and `fillDirectCallTrampolines`
 * (typed-this.ts) — **including their one documented limitation, that an
 * exceptional unwind skips the restore**. Being the single path that differs is
 * worth less than matching the established sequence.
 *
 * ## Admission — narrow, and each gate is a refusal rather than a guess
 *
 * `planObjectLiteralMethodReceiverBind` fires only when EVERY declaration of the
 * member symbol is an object-literal `PropertyAssignment` whose initializer is a
 * plain `FunctionExpression`, or a named native-generator declaration reference,
 * that references its own `this` (in the body or a parameter initializer):
 *
 *  - **`FunctionExpression`, never an arrow.** An arrow's `this` is lexical;
 *    installing a dynamic receiver would replace a correct answer with a wrong
 *    one. `{ m: () => … }` is deliberately untouched.
 *  - **A referenced generator declaration is admitted only for this exact
 *    property-assignment shape.** Its native frame snapshots the receiver while
 *    this call installs it; a plain declaration or any other receiver remains
 *    on its established path.
 *  - **The body or a parameter initializer must reference its own `this`** —
 *    the same function-like predicate used by the callee prologue, so the
 *    call-time writer and the deferred-body reader can never disagree. A
 *    method that ignores its receiver is byte-identical to before.
 *  - **Not a generator, not `async`, no explicit `this` parameter** — those
 *    carry their own receiver conventions.
 *  - **A shorthand `MethodDeclaration` is admitted when its own body contains
 *    `super`, or when it reads its own `this` in an object literal promoted to
 *    the standalone dynamic-prototype representation.** The latter narrow
 *    gate keeps mixed literals' ordinary methods on the same call-time
 *    receiver path as their `super` sibling; ordinary closed literals remain
 *    on the established static path.
 *  - **Every declaration must qualify.** A symbol declared by two literals, one
 *    of them arrow-valued, is refused rather than half-bound.
 *
 * An unresolvable member (an `any` receiver, a computed name with no symbol) has
 * no declarations and is refused, which keeps the whole `any` surface — where a
 * receiver could be anything — on its existing lowering.
