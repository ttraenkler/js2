/**
 * (#5195 Step 2) A parallel `$Object` carrying a class's STATIC members.
 *
 * The class object itself is a `$ClassName` struct singleton
 * (`expressions/extern.ts::emitLazyClassObjectGet`) and, per #3976, cannot be
 * converted to a real `$Object`: `new-super.ts::emitDynamicNewFallback` and
 * `property-access.ts::tryEmitConstructorViaTag` `ref.test` that value against
 * each class struct type and read its `__tag`, so a representation change
 * silently breaks value-bound `new K(...)`.
 *
 * So the static surface gets its own object instead, and the dynamic member
 * lookup is REDIRECTED to it when the receiver is the class-object singleton
 * (`class-proto-lookup.ts`). The class object keeps its struct identity; the
 * sidecar answers the questions a struct cannot.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all (the runtime-key half)
 *
 * `class C { static [x || 1]() {} }` installs a member under a key known only
 * at ClassDefinitionEvaluation. It has no source-spellable name — #5195 Step 1
 * carries it internally as `__cmdyn$<ordinal>` — so no static dispatch ladder
 * can reach it and `C[x || 1]()` folded to `ref.null.extern`. The prototype
 * side of that problem is solved by the prototype `$Object` (#3976); this is
 * the static twin, and it is why the sidecar is currently built only for
 * classes that HAVE such a member. Widening it to every class with statics is
 * the rest of #5195 cluster B (`gOPD(C,'sm')`, `C.hasOwnProperty('sm')`,
 * `length`/`name`/`prototype` through reflection), which additionally needs the
 * reflective natives redirected, not just `__extern_get`.
 *
 * ## What is installed, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * Every non-private static METHOD and static ACCESSOR, in `decl.members` order,
 * under its spec-visible key: an interned string for a folding key, the member's
 * `__cmkey_` global for a runtime one. §15.7.14 defines members in TEXTUAL
 * order, so the emitted install sequence IS that order and a later same-key
 * member replaces the earlier one — which is the only mechanism available for a
 * runtime key, whose collisions are unknowable at compile time (#5318 r4 review,
 * finding 1). Two exclusions:
 *
 *  - Static FIELDS keep the `staticProps` global lowering. Mirroring a mutable
 *    slot here would create two sources of truth for it. KNOWN RESIDUAL: a
 *    dynamic read of a runtime key that collides with a static field name
 *    therefore sees the sidecar's accessor/method where §15.7.14 (static field
 *    initializers run after every method and accessor is installed) says the
 *    FIELD wins, in either declaration order —
 *    `class Q { static get [x||"k"]() { return 11; } static k = 7; }` answers 11
 *    where node answers 7. Base answers `undefined`; both are wrong, and closing
 *    it means widening the sidecar to fields, i.e. the two-sources-of-truth
 *    exclusion above.
 *  - Static ACCESSORS are installed ONLY when the half's body never reads the
 *    receiver (#5318 Step 1c). Their
 *    compiled halves take the class STRUCT as the `this` parameter — the
 *    collection pass gives every accessor that receiver, static or not — while
 *    an accessor property stored on this object is invoked by
 *    `__call_accessor_get` with the RECEIVER, an `$Object`. For a half that
 *    READS the receiver that mismatch is an illegal cast at runtime, i.e. a
 *    trap, which is worse than the missing property it would fix; for a half
 *    that never reads it, the cached method trampoline already puts a null in
 *    the slot (`methodBodyReadsThis` in `closures/method-trampolines.ts`) and
 *    nothing observes the difference. So the receiver-free halves — which is
 *    every `static get [k]() { return <literal>; }` in the
 *    `cpn-class-*-accessors-*` family — are installed, and a receiver-reading
 *    one keeps the old missing-property answer rather than gaining a trap. The
 *    predicate is TRI-STATE: it reads the COMPILED body when that body exists
 *    (the top-level case), and falls back to a blunt full-subtree syntactic scan
 *    when it does not (every class nested in a function, arrow or method, whose
 *    sidecar is emitted while the enclosing function is still compiling). The
 *    old syntactic `genBodyReferencesThis` was neither: it stops descending at a
 *    nested class and so installed a half that traps (#5318 r4 review,
 *    finding 2). See {@link staticAccessorHalfIsReceiverFree}.
 *    Lifting the restriction needs a per-half trampoline supplying the dummy
 *    struct receiver the typed read path already uses
 *    (`property-access.ts::emitGetterCallWithDummy`).
