 * (#5327) Element-carrier compatibility for an unannotated array literal.
 *
 * `compileArrayLiteral` keys a vec to element zero's carrier and guard-casts
 * every later element into it. That is only sound when the later element
 * genuinely INHABITS element zero's WasmGC struct; this module owns the proof.
 *
 * The two `ValType`/type-table primitives underneath it —
 * `closedDataStructCarrierIdx` (is the guard-cast even in play?) and
 * `structCarrierInhabits` (does the candidate reach element zero's carrier
 * through its declared supertype chain?) — ask wasm-lowering questions,
 * deliberately ABOVE what `ctx.oracle` models, which is why the resolution runs
 * here rather than through the oracle (#1930 / #3273).

/**
 * Does a first-object array literal contain another element that cannot inhabit
 * the first object's exact closed struct? `compileArrayLiteral` historically
 * keyed the vec to element zero, then guarded-cast every later object to it.
 * Equal property names are not sufficient: `{params: {a: 1}}` and
 * `{params: {b: 2}}` have the same outer key but incompatible nested-field
 * carriers. Compare the resolved closed structs as well as the conservative
 * static key proof before retaining element zero's carrier. (#4289)
 *
 * (#5327) The same hazard exists when element zero is NOT written as an object
 * literal — a CALL that returns one is the common spelling
 * (`[group(doc), ifBreak(doc)]` in Prettier's `doc-builders` unit). #4289's
 * proof bailed out on its first line for any non-literal element zero, so such
 * a literal kept element zero's exact closed struct and guard-cast every later
 * element into it. Where the later element's struct shares no field layout with
 * element zero's, that coercion can only emit
 * `ref.test` → `ref.null` → `ref.as_non_null`, which TRAPS with "dereferencing
 * a null pointer" while the module is still initialising — measured on
 * prettier@3.8.1, where it took all 46 tests of `tests/unit/doc-builders.js`
 * with it (that file's `valid` array is `[group(doc), ifBreak(doc), …]`).
 *
 * So the non-literal arm compares resolved carriers directly. It stays narrow
 * on purpose: only elements that themselves resolve to a closed data struct are
 * consulted (a string / number / vec element is another widening's business),
 * and a struct that INHABITS element zero's carrier through the declared
 * supertype chain is fine — `[new Shape(), new Circle()]` must keep the closed
 * `$Shape` vec that #2021 relies on.
 *
 * NOT fixed here, and measured to survive this change: when the later element's
 * field NAMES are a superset of element zero's (`{type, contents}` then
 * `{type, n, contents}`) nothing traps — the coercion re-projects the shared
 * fields and silently drops `n`. Widening the literal stops that at
 * CONSTRUCTION, but the binding's own slot type is independently keyed to
 * TypeScript's best-common-supertype inference (`{type, contents}[]`) and the
 * store into it re-narrows every element the same lossy way. That is a
 * binding-slot defect, not a literal one; see the issue file.

/**
 * (#6613) Does the literal hold an element that CANNOT inhabit a closed

 *
 * This is the case {@link hasIncompatibleElementCarrier}'s doc comment names
 * and deliberately declines ("a string / number / vec element is another
 * widening's business"). It had no other widening. Element zero fixes the vec
 * to its closed `$__anon_N` struct and `compileArrayLiteral` guard-casts every
 * later element into it; for an element whose carrier is not a struct at all
 * the only lowering available is `ref.test` → `ref.null` → `ref.as_non_null`,
 * which TRAPS while the literal is still being CONSTRUCTED. Measured on this
 * tree, standalone, four lines and no provider:
 *
 *     const obj = { year: 1, month: 2, day: 3 };
 *     [obj, "str"].length            // RuntimeError: dereferencing a null pointer
 *
 * `[{ year: 1 }, "str"]` — the same array written with element zero INLINE —
 * already widens, because the first-object arm above rejects any non-object
 * sibling outright. Only the far more common binding spelling
 * (`const obj = {…}; [obj, "str"]`) reached this hole, since
 * `unwrapObjectLiteralElement` does not resolve an identifier to its
 * initializer.
 *
 * Narrowness, in the same spirit as the proof above:
 *
 *  - an element whose carrier IS a closed data struct is #4289/#5327's
 *    business (the declared-supertype chain decides), so it is skipped here;
 *  - an `externref`/`anyref` element is the dynamic widenings' business
 *    (`hasDynamicOrCallableElement` and friends) and is skipped too — which is
 *    also why the JS-host lane, where a string element is plain `externref`,
 *    is untouched by this predicate;
 *  - a spread, a hole and an `undefined`-like element are skipped exactly as
 *    the proof above skips them.
