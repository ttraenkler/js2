 * (#5383 S23 / #6610) `__extern_method_call`'s missing NUMBER-PRIMITIVE receiver
 * arm — `x.toPrecision(p)` where `x`'s static type is `any`.
 *
 * ## What was broken
 *
 * `__extern_method_call` dispatches `ref.test $Object` → resolve-and-apply, ELSE
 * the vec / closure-prop arms, ELSE `buildProtoNamedMethodMissArm`'s terminal
 * miss. A bare number primitive (`$box_number` / i31) is none of those three, so
 * it reached the terminal, whose consult is the #4160/#4176 proto-index store —
 * the table of members a MODULE installed on a builtin prototype. The BUILTIN
 * members of `Number.prototype` are not in it, the consult answered null, and
 * the #4221 absent-callee guard turned that into
 * `TypeError: called value is not a function`.
 *
 * Measured on this branch's base, one standalone module, no polyfill, no link
 * (`.tmp/s23/c1.mjs`):
 *
 * | probe                                      | base                                 |
 * | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
 * | `(1234.5678).toPrecision(3)` static recv   | `"1.23e+3"`                          |
 * | `f(x){return x.toPrecision(3)}` `any` recv | **`called value is not a function`** |
 * | same for `toFixed` / `toExponential`       | **`called value is not a function`** |
 * | `x.toString()` 0-arg through `any`         | `"255"` (a different arm serves it)  |
 * | `x.valueOf()` / `x.toLocaleString()`       | already correct                      |
 *
 * So the ANSWER machinery was never missing — only the routing for one receiver
 * brand. The two halves that do work prove it end to end on the same base:
 * `Number.prototype["toPrecision"]` read through an `any` binding resolves to a
 * function, and `.call(1234.5678, 3)` on that value answers `"1.23e+3"` with a
 * PRIMITIVE `this`. This arm performs that same resolution at the call.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * `block` + `br_if 0` ladder unshifted onto `__extern_method_call`, exactly the
 * `native-proto-method-call.ts` / `ta-dyn-method-call.ts` shape — the arm must
 * fall THROUGH to the untouched body on every decline, and `br_if 0` is the one
 * exit that leaves the stack empty on the way out.
 *
 *   1. `__typeof_number(recv)` — the receiver must be a number PRIMITIVE.
 *      Deliberately not a `typeof`-style widening: the predicate is
 *      `ref.test $box_number ∨ ref.test i31`, so a Number WRAPPER (`$Object`)
 *      never enters this arm and keeps the `$Object` route it already takes.
 *      (The wrapper spelling `new Number(x).toPrecision(3)` nevertheless goes
 *      from `called value is not a function` to `"1.23e+3"` — not from this
 *      arm, but from the #4619 mint below reaching `__extern_get`'s ladder,
 *      which that route already consults. Measured in `.tmp/s23/c5.mjs`.)
 *   2. `__extern_get(%Number.prototype%, name)` — the identity-stable
 *      `$NativeProto` singleton (`buildLazyNativeProtoGetInstrs`), whose members
 *      the #2175 companion seeder installs. Resolution is by NAME, so the arm
 *      has no per-member table and cannot drift from the prototype's own member
 *      set.
 *   3. Non-null ⇒ `__apply_closure(m, recv, args)` with the ORIGINAL primitive
 *      as `this`, which is what §21.1.3.x's `thisNumberValue` reads.
 *
 * ## Absent-not-wrong
 *
 * The arm claims the call ONLY when the member RESOLVES. `(5).nosuch()` still
 * reaches the terminal §13.3.6.2 step-5 TypeError, and every receiver brand but
 * a number primitive branches out at step 1, so nothing that answers correctly
 * today can be displaced.
 *
 * ## Why the demand gate, and why the scan is early while the arm is late
 *
 * Materializing `%Number.prototype%` pulls in its glue, its companion seeder and
 * the native member bodies. A module that never calls a Number format method
 * through a dynamic receiver must not pay for that, so the arm is gated on a
 * cheap, cached AST scan for a member CALL by one of the format names
 * ({@link NUMBER_PRIMITIVE_CALL_MEMBERS}) — the shapes that are broken today.
 * A module with no such call compiles byte-identically.
 *
 * The scan runs early (pure AST, one flag); the singleton is materialized in
 * {@link prepareNumberPrimitiveMethodCallArm} at finalize, BEFORE
 * `unshiftExternGetProtoMethodArm`; the arm itself is unshifted after it. That
 * ordering is load-bearing in both directions, and each half was measured:
 *
 * - Built during the source scan, `buildLazyNativeProtoGetInstrs` finds no
 *   `__protoidx_companion` in `funcMap` yet and skips the companion mint, so the
 *   singleton's dynamic member reads all miss.
 * - Built AFTER `unshiftExternGetProtoMethodArm`, the brand is not in that
 *   pass's minted/seeded set, so `__extern_get` has no ladder entry for it. The
 *   first cut of this slice did exactly that: the arm was emitted, the receiver
 *   test passed (verified with a probe throw), and the resolution answered null
 *   on every call — a fix that measures as a complete no-op.

/**
 * Member names whose DYNAMIC-receiver call this arm exists to repair.
 *
 * **`toPrecision` only, and the narrowness is measured, not cautious.** All
 * three §21.1.3 numeric-format methods report `called value is not a function`
 * through an `any` receiver on the base, but only `toPrecision` has a
 * REFLECTIVE native body (`number-proto-format.ts`, #5269 J-1). Widening the
 * list to `toFixed` / `toExponential` was tried and measured: they resolve to
 * `ensureStandaloneNativeMethodClosure`'s `refusalBodyFallback` stand-in and the
 * call answers `"Number.prototype.toFixed is not yet implemented in
 * --target standalone"`. That is a different TypeError, not a working call, and
 * no row in this slice's sample needs it — so the two are left exactly as they
 * are on the base and recorded as a named residual (their reflective bodies are
 * the next slice, not this one).
 *
 * `toString` was absent for the opposite reason: the 0-argument spelling already
 * answers correctly through another arm on the base. Its RADIX spelling
 * (`x.toString(16)` through an `any` receiver) was the residual named here, and
 * #6642 S62 closes it — the same reflective body
 * (`emitNumberProtoToStringBody`, §21.1.3.6 with the full radix ladder,
 * including the `undefined` ⇒ 10 carve-out) serves both arities, so routing the
 * member here is a pure routing change.
 *
 * {@link numberPrimitiveMemberDemandArity} is why adding it does not move bytes
 * on every module: `x.toString()` with NO argument appears in nearly every
 * standalone module and already answers, so the DEMAND scan only counts a
 * `toString` call that passes an argument. Once a module has demanded the arm
 * for any reason the arm claims BOTH arities for a number-primitive receiver —
 * one body, one answer — which is what keeps the two spellings from diverging.
