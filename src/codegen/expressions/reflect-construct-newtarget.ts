/**
 * #3371 r4 — runtime `GetPrototypeFromConstructor(NewTarget, …)` for
 * `Reflect.construct(target, args, NewTarget)` in `--target standalone`.
 *
 * ## What changed
 * The namespace-static `Reflect.construct` arm used to select the instance
 * prototype by SCANNING THE SOURCE for a prior `NewTarget.prototype = …`
 * assignment (`assignedNewTargetPrototype`). When that scan found nothing it
 * emitted a hard compile error — the "#3371 refusal" that made 23 ES2015 rows
 * `compile_error`. A source scan can never model the real operation, which is
 * `? Get(NewTarget, "prototype")` (ES §10.1.14 step 2): an ordinary property
 * read that can run a getter, throw, or mutate the world.
 *
 * This module supplies that real read. It is used ONLY on the branch that used
 * to `reportError`, so no program that compiled before reaches any of it — the
 * static-assignment path and the non-distinct path are untouched.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 * NewTarget is evaluated exactly once, BEFORE the argument list, into an
 * externref local; `Get(NT, "prototype")` runs AFTER the ordinary construction
 * completes. That order is what the ES2015 rows in this cluster pin:
 *
 *   - `DataView/byteOffset-validated-against-initial-buffer-length.js` — the
 *     RangeError from offset validation must win over the prototype getter, so
 *     the getter must NOT run before construction.
 *   - `TypedArrayConstructors/…/throw-type-error-before-custom-proto-access.js`
 *     — same shape: `ToIndex(Symbol())` must throw first.
 *   - the six `custom-proto-access-throws.js` rows — the getter throws, and the
 *     throw propagates out of `Reflect.construct` whichever side of the
 *     allocation it runs on.
 *
 * The rows that require the read to happen strictly BEFORE allocation
 * (`ArrayBuffer/data-allocation-after-object-creation.js`) are NOT served by
 * this shape and stay refused; see the issue file's residual list.
 *
 * ## Applying the result
 * `applyRuntimeNewTargetPrototype` writes the fetched prototype onto whichever
 * carrier the construction produced: the DataView window struct, the dynamic
 * typed-array view struct, or — for anything else — the ordinary
 * `__object_setPrototypeOf` path. Before this the "no carrier arm matched" case
 * was itself a compile error.
 *
 * ## What this path REFUSES, and why (2026-09-05 review round 1)
 * The read and the write are only sound for some target/NewTarget shapes, and
 * every shape outside that set is handed back to the pre-existing #3371
 * refusal rather than answered wrongly. `classifyRuntimeNewTargetSite` is the
 * one gate; each clause below is a MEASURED wrong answer on the r4 tree
 * (`--target standalone`, node 22 as the oracle):
 *
 *   - **NewTarget denotes a class.** A class value's prototype object is not
 *     reified in standalone at all: `C.prototype` compiles to `null` even with
 *     a literal key (measured on BASE too, so it is not this arm's doing), and
 *     `__reflect_is_constructor` has no class arm, so a class reaching the
 *     runtime classifier throws "newTarget is not a constructor". Refused.
 *   - **The target reads `new.target`.** `new.target` is an i32 class-id module
 *     global keyed by class NAME (#2023); the constructed frame cannot carry a
 *     NewTarget VALUE, so the body reads `undefined` and a standard
 *     `if (new.target === undefined) throw` guard fires where node constructs.
 *     Refused. A read inside a NESTED function counts too whenever that
 *     function can itself be constructed — `readsNewTarget` explains why.
 *   - **A dynamic (reassigned) in-file function target that can hold anything
 *     but an ordinary function.** Review round 1 found this admitted on the
 *     kind of the binding's INITIALIZER alone, so `T = A` (async),
 *     `T = () => {}`, `T = function*(){}`, `T = C`, `T = G.bind(null)`,
 *     `T = undefined` and an alias chain all compiled and answered wrongly.
 *     `dynamicTargetIsAllOrdinaryFunctions` enumerates the value set instead,
 *     and also refuses a binding carrying an explicit type annotation.
 *   - **A NewTarget expression that is not a bare identifier.** The fallback
 *     route hands target+arguments to `compileNewExpression`, which evaluates
 *     AND constructs in one step, and §26.1.2 requires the IsConstructor check
 *     on NewTarget to precede construction — so there is no seam to evaluate
 *     the NewTarget expression between the argument list and the allocation.
 *     Restricting NewTarget to an identifier makes its evaluation
 *     side-effect-free, which is what makes reading it before the arguments
 *     unobservable. Anything else is refused rather than reordered.
 *   - **A target whose instance has no settable prototype.** The nominal
 *     carriers have no `$proto` field, so `__object_setPrototypeOf` is a silent
 *     no-op on them: `Reflect.construct(Array, [3], NT)` answered
 *     `Array.prototype` where node answers `NT.prototype`. A user class, an
 *     in-file function the driver route declined, and the named builtin list
 *     below all refuse for this reason. Deliberately NOT refused are the
 *     carriers whose `Object.getPrototypeOf` is independently broken on base
 *     (Promise, class instances, typed-array views — see the list's comment):
 *     those programs read a wrong prototype with or without this arm, and
 *     refusing them would drop passing rows for no correctness gain.
 *   - **The driver route with a NewTarget whose `prototype` is not a plain
 *     `$Object`.** `__native_construct_N` stores the supplied prototype only
 *     when it passes `ref.test $Object`; a prototype that is an object-literal
 *     carrier (e.g. installed by `Object.defineProperty(NT, "prototype", …)`)
 *     is silently dropped and the instance gets `%Object.prototype%`. The
 *     route is therefore limited to a NewTarget binding whose `prototype` is
 *     provably untouched.

 *     `/** @type {number} *\/ let n = 0, T = F` — the `number` describes `n`;

 * With the trap absent the driver forwards to `[[ProxyTarget]]` and derives
 * newTarget afresh from the INNER proxy, so a nested proxy loses it twice.
 *
 * This arm calls `__proxy_construct_chain`, which walks the [[ProxyTarget]]
 * chain with the caller's newTarget held INVARIANT, and falls back to the
 * ordinary [[Construct]] driver on `__proxy_ultimate_target` only when no proxy
 * in the chain trapped — the same shape `tryEmitOrdinaryConstructWithNewTarget`

/**
 * Is `name`'s `prototype` property provably the one its declaration installed?
 *
 * The ordinary-construct driver stores the supplied prototype only when it
 * passes `ref.test $Object`; an object-literal carrier installed by
 * `Object.defineProperty(NT, "prototype", …)` fails that test and is dropped
 * without a word, leaving the instance on `%Object.prototype%`. A pristine
 * binding cannot be in that state, so the driver route is limited to one.
 *
 * That rationale is MEASURED, not assumed (r2 step 4): with every clause that
 * would refuse it disabled, `.tmp/p/d1_defineprop_slot.js` — an ordinary
 * function target and `Object.defineProperty(NT, "prototype", { value: P })`
 * — compiles and answers 1 where node answers 7, i.e. the instance lands on
 * `%Object.prototype%` and neither `Object.getPrototypeOf(o) === P` nor
 * `o.tag === 9` holds. The shape is refused twice over, since TypeScript also
 * synthesises an expando declaration for that `defineProperty`, which the
 * declaration-count check below rejects on its own.
 *
 * ## Mutation is not replacement (r2 step 4, measured)
 * `NT.prototype.tag = 9`, `Object.assign(NT.prototype, …)` and
 * `Object.defineProperty(NT.prototype, …)` MUTATE the object the slot already
 * holds; the slot still holds the plain `$Object` the declaration installed,
 * so the `ref.test` above still passes and all three answer node (7, 7, 7 —
 * `.tmp/p/b2_driver_protomut.js`, `b7_object_assign_proto.js`,
 * `c3_defineprop_on_proto.js`, each a `(#3371)` compile error on base). Only a
 * write whose target is the SLOT — `NT.prototype = …`, `NT["prototype"] = …`,
 * a computed `NT[k] = …`, or an `Object.*` call whose RECEIVER is the bare
 * `NT` — replaces it.
 *
 * ## Why the WRITE clauses stay keyed on the NAME (r2 step 3, measured)
 * The plan asked for the whole predicate to resolve through `ctx.oracle`.
 * Only the BINDING-COUNT clause can: the compiler's own model of a function's
 * `prototype` slot is itself name-keyed, and a prototype write to a
 * same-spelled binding in another scope corrupts the read of THIS one. With no
 * `Reflect.construct` in the program at all, `.tmp/p/m5e_read_only_base.js`
 * — an outer `function NT(){}` plus an inner `const NT = function(){}` whose
 * prototype slot is redefined — reads the OUTER `NT.prototype` as null on
 * BASE (base 5, node 6). Resolving the write clauses by symbol therefore
 * admitted `.tmp/p/m5_nt_block_shadow_mutates.js` at 1 where node answers 3.
 * So: the binding count is gone (that was the measured over-refusal — an
 * unrelated parameter of the same name), and a prototype-slot write to ANY
 * same-spelled binding still refuses, matching what the reader can actually
 * distinguish.
