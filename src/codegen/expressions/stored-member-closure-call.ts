/**
 * (#4096) `o.f(…)` where `f` is a **stored function-valued member** of a
 * receiver whose static type is CLOSED (an object-literal struct, an array, a
 * regexp) — the shape an expando assignment produces:
 *
 * ```js
 * var o = { a: 1 };
 * o.f = function () { return 7; };
 * o.f();          // standalone before this arm: null. Expected: 7.
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why this arm exists
 *
 * The receiver's Wasm carrier is a CONCRETE struct ref, not `externref`, so the
 * any-receiver closed-method dispatcher (#2151, gated on
 * `isAnyOrExternref` in `call-receiver-method.ts`) never sees the call — and
 * that dispatcher is where #3117 already added the field-stored-closure arms
 * for the `any` twin (`const o: any = {}; o.f = function(){}; o.f()`). With no
 * static arm claiming the call either (there is no `<Struct>_f` method — `f` is
 * a FIELD holding a closure, not a declared method), the call fell all the way
 * through to `compileTailDispatch`'s graceful fallback, which evaluates the
 * callee and the arguments for side effects, DROPS them, and pushes
 * `ref.null.extern`.
 *
 * That fallback is the "detector that cannot say I don't know": an unrecognised
 * call shape answers `undefined` instead of refusing, so an ordinary
 * JavaScript program gets a silent wrong answer. Worse, the arguments are
 * evaluated but the *callee* never runs, so a spec-required `toString` /
 * getter side effect (and any `try/catch` around it) never fires at all.
 *
 * ## The lowering, and why it is not new
 *
 * Reading the member and invoking it already works on this lane:
 * `var g = o.f; g.call(o)` returns the right value. This arm emits exactly that
 * composition, with the receiver threaded as `this`:
 *
 *     T = <receiver as externref>
 *     F = <o.f as externref>          ;; the same member read that already works
 *     __apply_closure(F, T, [args…])  ;; the #1888/#3117 this-threaded bridge
 *
 * `__apply_closure` is the *same* bridge the closed-method dispatcher's
 * field-stored-closure arms use, so no new dispatch vocabulary is introduced.
 *
 * ## Blast radius
 *
 * The arm sits immediately before the graceful fallback, so every shape it can
 * claim is one that produces `ref.null.extern` today — it cannot displace a
 * working path. It is further narrowed to:
 *
 *  - host-free lanes only (`standalone`/`wasi`); the JS-host lane is already
 *    correct on all 14 cells of the #4096 trigger table and is left untouched;
 *  - a plain **identifier** receiver, so re-reading it for `this` is
 *    side-effect-free and evaluation order is preserved;
 *  - a member some `<expr>.<name> = …` assignment in the source could have
 *    stored, which is the only way this shape arises;
 *  - no spread arguments and at most `__apply_closure`'s dispatch cap.
 *
 * `__apply_closure` answers the undefined sentinel (`ref.null.extern`) for a
 * non-callable or an unsupported arity (S1 scope, see `fillApplyClosure`), so
 * even a mis-admitted shape lands on exactly the value the fallback produced —
 * this arm cannot make a currently-`undefined` answer worse.
 *
 * ## Known gap (deliberate, not an oversight)
 *
 * A member that is `null`/absent at RUNTIME should raise a `TypeError`
 * (§7.3.14 step 2). `__apply_closure` returns `undefined` instead — the same
 * S1 no-throw carve-out documented on `fillApplyClosure`, for the same
 * late-registration index-shift reason. This arm inherits that gap; it does not
 * widen it.

/**
 * (#4640 D1) `var x = undefined; x()` / `var x = null; x()` — §13.3.6.1
 * EvaluateCall step 4: after the callee reference and the argument list are
 * evaluated, `IsCallable(func)` is checked and a **TypeError** is thrown.
 *
 * ## What was actually wrong (it is not what the issue's map said)
 *
 * The map read this family as "the thrown thing is `[object Object]`, not a
 * TypeError instance". Measured on the base branch, the call threw **nothing at
 * all**: `try { var x = undefined; x(); } catch (e) {}` fell through with no
 * exception. The `[object Object]` in the failure text is the test's OWN
 * `Test262Error` — thrown on the line after the call that should have thrown,
 * then rendered by the catch block. So this is not an error-identity fix; the
 * `emitThrowTypeError` lowering already mints a real `$Error_struct` TypeError.
 * It is a missing throw.
 *
 * ## Why it lands HERE and not in `tryNonCallableValueCall`
 *
 * That static guard (#4221) is the natural home, and it declines on purpose:
 * `var x = undefined` is an unannotated mutable binding with a nullish
 * initializer, which `isEvolvingAnyBinding` treats as committing NOTHING (the
 * #4616 carve-out — `let x = null; … x = function(){…}; x()` is a real idiom and
 * a static throw there would be a hard miscompile). Relaxing that guard to catch
 * this row would reintroduce exactly the miscompile it was added to prevent. The
 * runtime check has no such tension: a value that IS nullish when the call
 * executes cannot be callable, whatever the checker believed.
 *
 * ## Why it is a narrowing, not a new risk
 *
 * It sits immediately before the graceful fallback, so every shape it can claim
 * already answers the VALUE `undefined` with the callee never invoked. It only
 * replaces that silent wrong answer when the callee is nullish AT RUNTIME —
 * every non-nullish value keeps the fallback's behaviour byte-for-byte
 * (`ref.null.extern`), because "our dispatch did not recognise this shape" and
 * "this value is not callable" are different claims and only the second is
 * provable here.
 *
 * Restricted to a plain **identifier** callee. A member callee (`o.f()`) reads
 * `null` on this lane for reasons that are frequently OUR gap rather than the
 * program's — a member our object model failed to resolve is indistinguishable
 * from an absent one, so throwing there would convert compiler gaps into hard
 * runtime throws. An identifier read is a local/global slot read: if it answers
 * nullish, the binding really holds `null`/`undefined`.
 *
 * Host-lane untouched (`standalone`/`wasi` only) — the JS-host lane routes
 * these calls through `__extern_call`, which already throws.
 *
 * Order is §13.3.6.1's: callee, then arguments, THEN the throw.

/**
 * (#4207) `<non-identifier receiver>.<m>(…)` for a module that installed a
 * NAMED property on a builtin prototype — the shape
 * {@link tryEmitStoredMemberClosureCall} declines because it would have to read
 * the receiver twice. Here the receiver is evaluated ONCE into the
 * `__extern_method_call` receiver slot, so there is no re-read to worry about
 * and no ordering hazard.
 *
 * Same blast radius argument as the arm above: it sits immediately before the
 * graceful fallback, so every shape it can claim answers `ref.null.extern`
 * today, and `__extern_method_call` answers the same undefined sentinel on a
 * miss. Gated on `ctx.protoNamedDirty` (a pre-scan flag), so a module that
 * never writes a named property onto a builtin prototype emits byte-identically.
