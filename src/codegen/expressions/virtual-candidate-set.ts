/**
 * (#5249) Candidate set for an OPEN-receiver `this.m(…)` call.
 *
 * "Open receiver" = the method is not declared on the receiver's own class or
 * any ancestor, so the only implementations live BELOW it — the shape
 * `class Base { run(x) { return this.n(x); } }` with `n` declared on
 * `class A extends Base` and friends. `emitVirtualMethodDispatchByTag`
 * (`virtual-dispatch.ts`) turns >1 implementation into a `__tag` cascade whose
 * terminal `else` is `unreachable`, so the candidate set IS the set of
 * receivers that do not trap.
 *
 * The set used to be "DIRECT children of the receiver class that DECLARE the
 * method", which under-approximates it twice:
 *
 *   1. a **grandchild that declares** an override (`D extends B extends Base`)
 *      is not a direct child, so it got no arm;
 *   2. a **descendant that inherits** an implementation (`C extends A`, `C`
 *      declares nothing) has no `C_n` of its own, so it got no arm either —
 *      even though `C.n` resolves perfectly well to `A_n`.
 *
 * Both trap at run time on a module `compile()` reports clean. Measured on
 * `@js-temporal/polyfill@0.5.1`: `HelperBase.adjustCalendarDate` calls
 * `this.monthsInYear(…)`, `HelperBase` does not declare it, and exactly the
 * SEVEN direct children that do declare it got arms — while the 19 further
 * descendants (`GregoryHelper`, `RocHelper`, `JapaneseHelper`, the five
 * `Islamic*` helpers, …) all reach `unreachable`. That is the whole of the
 * 123-row `unreachable in HelperBase_adjustCalendarDate()` test262 family.
 *
 * This module answers the same question over the FULL descendant set, with
 * each descendant resolved to its nearest declaring ancestor — i.e. exactly
 * JS prototype lookup, restricted to the closed set of classes in the module.
 *
 * Order is load-bearing: the declared-direct-children come first, in the same
 * `classParentMap` iteration order as before, so `candidates[0]` — which the
 * caller uses for the static fallback name and which the emitter uses as its
 * result-type schema — is unchanged wherever the old code produced one.
 *
 * Statics are deliberately excluded from the widening: a `__tag` cascade reads
 * an INSTANCE field, and static methods are not reached through an instance
 * tag, so the static path keeps its historical direct-children-only set.
