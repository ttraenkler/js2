/**
 * (#4187) The single member-delete walk, answering both questions the module

 * identifiers** are deleted from.
 *
 * Fused, and `collectReceivers` is a COST switch, not a convenience. #2179's
 * boolean short-circuits on the first hit; collecting names cannot, because a
 * later statement may delete from a different receiver. Giving up that
 * short-circuit unconditionally cost **+3,847** on the #3437 harness
 * compile-work budget (111,568 → 115,415), which meters shared-helper
 * `forEachChild` invocations over a fixture whose prelude is prepended to all
 * ~43k test262 files. Since `memberDeleteReceiverNames` is read only by the
 * STANDALONE arm of the `hasOwnProperty` routing gate, host-mode callers pass
 * `false` and keep main's exact traversal — the budget fixture compiles in host
 * mode and returns to 111,568.
 *
 * @returns `any` — a `delete o.a` / `delete o[k]` occurs somewhere (a no-op
 *   `delete x` of a bare identifier does NOT count: it leaves no tombstone for
 *   the inline `struct.get` read fast-path to miss).
 * @returns `receiverNames` — see {@link scanModuleMemberDeletes}; empty
 *   when `collectReceivers` is false. A strict subset of what sets `any`:
 *   `delete a.b.c` and `delete f().x` have no identifier receiver, so they set
 *   `any` and contribute no name.

 *
 * ---
 *
 * (#2179) `any` is true when the source contains a `delete` operating on a
 * property or element access (`delete o.a` / `delete o[k]`). `delete x` of a
 * bare identifier and `delete <other expr>` (no-op deletes) do NOT count — only
 * member deletes can leave a runtime tombstone that the inline `struct.get`
 * read fast-path would bypass. Gates the tombstone-aware read routing so
 * delete-free modules emit byte-identical wasm.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * (#4187) `receiverNames` holds identifier names used as the RECEIVER of a
 * member delete anywhere in the program — `delete r.k` / `delete r[e]` yields
 * `r`.
 *
 * Consumed by `compilePropertyIntrospection` to decide whether a STANDALONE
 * `r.hasOwnProperty(k)` / `r.propertyIsEnumerable(k)` on a receiver that also
 * saw an `Object.defineProperty` may keep its compile-time constant fold. The
 * fold answers from the (defineProperty-widened) struct SHAPE, which no runtime
 * `delete` can retract, so it and the runtime state diverge for exactly the
 * receivers that appear here — and only for those. Receivers never deleted from
 * keep folding, so the overwhelming majority of modules stay byte-identical.
 *
 * Why a whole-program PRE-SCAN and not record-as-you-compile: in the canonical
 * repro the first read (`obj.hasOwnProperty("property")`, expected `true`)
 * precedes the `delete` TEXTUALLY. An order-sensitive record would route the
 * later read and fold the earlier one, so the two reads would answer from two
 * different mechanisms. The pre-scan routes BOTH to the runtime helper, which is
 * correct for both — it reports `true` before the delete and `false` after.
 *
 * Deliberately RECEIVER-scoped rather than receiver+key: `delete r[k]` with a
 * computed key can remove any property of `r`, so a key-level gate would have to
 * treat a computed delete as covering every key anyway. Bare `delete r` (a
 * no-op delete of a binding) does NOT count — it removes no property.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT alias-aware: `var a = r; delete a.k` records `a`, not `r`.
 * That is the safe direction — a missed name simply keeps today's fold, which is
 * exactly main's behaviour, whereas a spurious name would cost a runtime call on
 * a receiver that never needed one.

 * HasBinding on the global environment record they are just as resolvable by a
 * bare identifier as the `p1 = 1` form {@link collectSloppyImplicitGlobalNames}
 * already covers. Without them, a bare `p1` read after `this.p1 = 1` resolved to
 * nothing and fell through to codegen's auto-allocated-local fallback, silently
 * reading `0`/`undefined` instead of the value that was written.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, because a false positive here turns a currently-silent
 * wrong answer into a thrown `ReferenceError`:
 *   - TOP-LEVEL CODE only — a `this.x = …` inside a function is a write to that
 *     function's receiver, not to the global object. "Top-level code" is the
 *     §9.4.2 sense used by {@link thisBelongsToTopLevelCode} and the #3365
 *     `ThisKeyword` lowering: the walk descends through `if` / loops / `try` /
 *     blocks and stops at a function or class boundary. (#4205 — the original
 *     #3956 cut looked only at DIRECT SourceFile ExpressionStatements, so
 *     `if (c) { this.r = 2; }` performed the write but never registered the
 *     name, and the bare `r` read fell back to the silent `0`.)
 *   - Root must be `this`, a non-shadowed `globalThis`, or a top-level ALIAS of
 *     one of those (`var g = this; g.q = 7` — the ES5 `fnGlobalObject()` idiom;
 *     any top-level reassignment of the alias name disqualifies it), reached
 *     only through parens / casts, with exactly one member step (`this.p1`,
 *     `this["p1"]`); a deeper chain like `this.o.k` writes into `o`, not the
 *     global object.
 *
 *     A reassignment INSIDE a function body does not disqualify — deliberately,
 *     because ruling it out costs a whole-file traversal (#3437) and buys
 *     nothing observable: if such a reassignment ran, the write landed on some
 *     other object, the global object has no such property, and the bare read
 *     throws the `ReferenceError` the spec asks for anyway.
 *   - Static property names only (identifier or string literal); a computed key
 *     is not knowable here.
 *   - No strict-mode gate: unlike an unresolvable bare assignment, a write
 *     through the global object is legal and creates the property in strict
 *     code too.
 *
 * The read path consults this set only AFTER locals, captures, module globals
 * and functions have all missed, so a name that also has a real binding can
 * never be diverted here.

 * (#1719 S1) Whole-program pre-scan for the `ITER_OVERRIDDEN` brand of the
 * array object-value representation track. Returns true iff the source may
 * monkeypatch `Array.prototype`'s iterator surface, i.e. it contains:
 *   (i)  an assignment `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = …` or
 *        `Array.prototype.values = …` (any element/property access whose
 *        object is `Array.prototype`), OR
 *   (ii) `Object.defineProperty(Array.prototype, …)` /
 *        `Object.defineProperties(Array.prototype, …)`.
 *
 * When this returns false (the overwhelming common case), the array
 * destructuring / spread / for-of fast paths are provably unaffected by any
 * prototype override and stay byte-identical (see `arrayDstrNeedsIdentity`).
 * When true, the S2 slice routes a branded array RHS through the host-Array
 * reflection + host `GetIterator` so the override's `@@iterator` is observed
 * (§7.4.2 GetIterator, §8.5.2 IteratorBindingInitialization).
 *
 * Reused verbatim from the dev-a `issue-1719-impl` scaffolding (the front-end
 * half the architecture spec endorses keeping). Conservative by design: it
 * over-approximates (a false positive only costs the S2 slow path, never
 * correctness) and never under-approximates a literal `Array.prototype` LHS.
