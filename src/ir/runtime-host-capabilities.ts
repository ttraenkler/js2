/**
 * The single closed authority for every R6 host-capability ABI record.
 *
 * Before #3526 F1-S1 the only capability records were async ones, so the
 * catalogue lived inside `async-runtime-providers.ts`. The number-boundary
 * family (`env.__box_number` / `env.__unbox_number`) is the first non-async
 * consumer, and R6 admits exactly ONE record table: a second table would let
 * two families disagree about the same import's ABI, which is the failure the
 * typed contract exists to prevent.
 *
 * `async-runtime-providers.ts` now derives its async-only projection from this
 * table and deliberately keeps its own NARROWED value-type union
 * (`externref | i32`). The async adapter materializer treats every non-`i32`
 * row as externref, so widening the async-facing union to include `f64` would
 * silently mislower a number record. The narrowing is load-bearing.
 *
 * (#3526 F1-S2) The boolean row is why that narrowing is not, on its own,
 * sufficient: `boolean.box` is `(i32) -> externref`, so every one of its value
 * types IS admissible under `AsyncHostAdapterValueType`. What keeps it out of
 * the async projection is the ID filter — `ASYNC_HOST_CAPABILITY_ID_SET`, the
 * closed `async.*` names — not the value union. Never replace that filter with
 * a value-type test.
 *
 * (#3526 F2-S2) The schema is now KIND-DISCRIMINATED. Family 2's remaining
 * host crossings do not all live in `env`, and two of them are not functions
 * at all:
 *
 *  * `wasm:js-string.{concat,equals,length,charCodeAt}` are func imports in a
 *    NON-`env` module namespace, which the pre-F2-S2 record type could not
 *    spell (`module` was the literal `"env"`).
 *  * string literals reach the host lane as GLOBAL imports whose import FIELD
 *    is the literal itself (`string_constants."f"`), or the hex of its UTF-16
 *    code units when it contains a lone surrogate
 *    (`string_constants16."d800"`). A closed catalogue cannot enumerate
 *    per-literal field names, so a global row carries a field SCHEME rather
 *    than a field name.
 *
 * This slice moves NO boundary: it only makes those crossings expressible.
 * No provider references the six new rows, so `freeze()` never selects them
 * and every frozen manifest, import and emitted body is byte-identical.

/**

 * STATIC catalogue is the authority over the maker's `env`.`__make_callback`
 * ABI at build time, and the FROZEN manifest is the authority over whether that
 * crossing is admitted at all, post-freeze
 * (`preparedHostCallbackWrapProvider`). Both name the same record — this one —
 * so neither authority can drift from the other.
 *
 * Scope, precisely: this covers the IR seam. Renaming the record's `field`
 * lands in one place FOR THAT SEAM, but two legacy sites still spell the maker
 * by hand — `src/codegen/declarations/import-collector.ts:2010`/`:2053` mint
 * `env.__make_callback` and `src/codegen/async-frame.ts:165` looks it up
 * through `ctx.funcMap` — so a rename must move those too. Measured
 * fail-safe rather than silent: perturbing the field to `__make_callback_probe`
 * demotes the whole module to a 504-byte legacy build rather than miscompiling.
 * Bringing those two under the record is F3-S2's `callback.wrap.*` sibling row.
