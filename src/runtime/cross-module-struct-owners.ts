// cross-module-struct-owners.ts — (#5225) the INBOUND twin of #5222.
//
// #5222 fixed the EXIT boundary of the #2527 linked-provider seam: a value the
// PROVIDER minted keeps the host mirror bound to the provider's exports, so the
// consumer can still decode it. This file answers the other direction.
//
// A raw WasmGC struct carries no decoder. Everything that reads one —
// `__struct_field_names`, `__sget_<field>`, `__call_fn_*` — is an EXPORT of one
// specific module, and every runtime read path resolves those exports from the
// module it is currently running inside (`callbackState.getExports()`). That is
// correct for a single module and wrong the moment two linked modules exchange
// values: an object literal built in the CONSUMER and handed to a provider
// function reaches the provider's `__extern_get` with the provider's exports,
// which cannot name a single one of its fields. It reads as an opaque object
// with zero members (`Temporal.PlainDate.from({year, month, day})` →
// "year is required").
//
// The registry below records every module of one linked project and answers
// "who can decode this value?". It is deliberately a MISS-PATH mechanism: the
// callers consult it only after the local exports have already failed to name
// the struct or to serve the field, so the single-module lane and the linked
// hot path (`__extern_get` runs ~10k times per `run()` on mixed/csv-parse,
// #3903) are byte-identical to before. With fewer than two modules registered
// the whole thing short-circuits on one boolean.
