/**
 * #6655 — a dynamic call to a function with MORE THAN EIGHT declared formals
 * must run the function under `--target standalone`, not trap.
 *
 * `fillApplyClosure` builds `__apply_closure`'s dispatcher ladder over
 * `n = max(argc, __closure_arity(fn))` with one arm per arity `0..8`, and
 * guards the top with a deliberate `unreachable` ("a compiled closure above
 * the cap must fail loudly rather than falling through to the undefined
 * sentinel"). `__call_fn_method_<N>` was minted only for `N <= 8`, so a
 * NINE-formal callee reached through the dynamic bridge widened `n` past the
 * last arm and trapped instead of being called.
 *
 * That is not an exotic shape: test262's own
 * `TemporalHelpers.assertPlainDateTime` has 14 formals and
 * `createDurationPropertyBagObserver` has 11, which is how three standalone
 * Temporal rows failed with `RuntimeError: unreachable in __apply_closure()`.
 *
 * `spread14` below is the defect, and it is the ONLY row that moves: on a
 * file-copy revert of the three touched files to the branch base
 * `bccd46c552` this file fails with exactly one differing key,
 * `spread14: "TRAP unreachable"` (measured, `.tmp/s73/witness-base.log`).
 *
 * Every other row — including `spread9`, one formal past the historical cap —
 * already answers correctly on that base, so the controls cannot carry this
 * file green. They are here to pin that widening a module's dispatcher set
 * changes NOTHING for what already worked, and `spread9` additionally records
 * that the trap is not simply "declared arity > 8": some above-cap shapes
 * never reach the dynamic bridge at all.
