// #2580 M3 B-protoextend — inherited indexed data/accessor on the
// `Object.prototype` chain, read by the generic `Array.prototype.X.call(arrayLike, …)`
// cluster (host/gc mode).
//
// Root cause (verified per-process + runtime trace, host mode):
//   A generic Array method invoked on an array-like *plain object* receiver
//   (`Array.prototype.indexOf.call({length:3}, v)`) reads `obj[i]` via §7.3.2
//   `Get`, which walks the receiver's `[[Prototype]]` chain to `%Object.prototype%`.
//   A test that does `Object.prototype[0] = true` makes `({length:3})[0]` resolve
//   to `true`. In this compiler an array-like plain-object receiver is an OPAQUE
//   WasmGC struct whose runtime `[[Prototype]]` is `null`, so the own-only
//   `obj[i]` / sidecar lookups in `__extern_get_idx` / `__extern_has_idx` missed
//   the inherited index — the generic-method loop skipped it. The trace showed
//   `(idx in obj) === false` while `idx in Object.prototype === true`:
//   `Object.prototype[i] = v` lands on the REAL host `Object.prototype`, but the
//   struct receiver never consulted it.
//
// Fix: as the FINAL fallback in `__extern_get_idx` / `__extern_has_idx` (after own
// struct fields, the sidecar and own accessor descriptors miss), consult
// `%Object.prototype%[idx]` — the single `[[Prototype]]` chain every object value
// shares (matching the architect decision to route inherited reads through the ONE
// shared `Object.prototype` walk, not a per-receiver prototype field). A real
// array / `$Vec` / any receiver carrying its own element is resolved earlier and
// never enters this arm, so the hot path is unchanged.
//
// SCOPE: inherited DATA properties on `Object.prototype` for an array-like
// plain-object receiver — the `built-ins/Array/prototype/<m>/<m>-9-b-i-N`
// "inherited data property on an Array-like object" subset. `Array.prototype[i]=v`
// inherited on REAL arrays already resolves through the native array path; the
// fnctor `.prototype=` lap (B-fnctor) and getter-bodies that close over outer
// scope are separate, later sub-mechanisms. Host/gc mode.
