// #1032 — axios Tier 1 stress test: minimal `axios.get()` smoke test.
//
// Goal: drive the axios module graph through `compileProject` and
// document — at the granularity of "compiles OK / validates OK /
// instantiates OK / runs OK" — what works on `main` today. Each `it`
// covers one rung of the ladder; the last passing rung tells us where
// the next fix lands.
//
// Methodology mirrors `tests/stress/eslint-tier1.test.ts` and
// `tests/stress/react-tier1.test.ts`: an inline entry source written to
// a tmp file, run through `compileProject`, optionally validated /
// instantiated / exercised. Every failing rung is `it.skip` with a
// pointer to the specific blocking issue so the test progressively
// unskips as those issues close.
//
// Survey reference: `plan/issues/backlog/axios-tier1-survey.md` —
// captures the three NEW blockers observed across 10 entry points
// (bare-package shim, CJS bundle, ESM aggregator, lib/utils, lib/core,
// lib/adapters). Tracking parent: `plan/issues/backlog/1032-compile-axios-to-wasm-node.md`.
//
// Blockers discovered while writing this test (pending sprint issue
// filing — placeholders #TBD-1..#TBD-3 until PO triages):
//
//   - #TBD-1 — `compileProject` hangs on every entry that pulls in the
//     full `lib/core/Axios.js` graph (4 of 10 entries: `index.js`,
//     `lib/axios.js`, `lib/core/Axios.js`, `lib/adapters/http.js`).
//     Non-termination, not a slow compile — kill-9 is the only escape.
//     This is the most severe blocker; gates four Tier 1 rungs.
//   - #TBD-2 — `AxiosHeaders_set` validation error:
//       `any.convert_extern[0] expected externref, found global.get of type (ref null N)`
//     Extern boxing missing for the WasmGC-struct → externref direction.
//     Seen on `dist/node/axios.cjs` and `lib/core/AxiosError.js`.
//   - #TBD-3 — `isBuffer` validation error:
//       `fallthru[0] expected i32, got f64`
//     `&&` chain mixes i32 short-circuit branches with an f64-typed
//     terminal extern call. Same family as ESLint #1558 (`f64.eq[0]`)
//     and the React-tier1 `mapIntoArray` finding — strong candidate
//     for an umbrella issue covering all three libraries.
//
// ── Status refresh (2026-07-17, #1032 dev-1044) ────────────────────────
//   - #TBD-3 RESOLVED: `lib/utils.js` now compiles AND validates on main
//     (~84 KB module). The i32/f64 `&&`/`fallthru` unification family has
//     since been fixed. Tier 1g unskipped below as a regression guard.
//   - #TBD-2 (AxiosHeaders_set extern boxing) is now only observable when a
//     JS npm file is compiled as the *entry* (Tier 1d/1h) — as a graph
//     dependency its diagnostics are filtered (compiler.ts `isEntryDiag`).
//     Compiling `lib/core/AxiosError.js` as an entry now stops EARLIER, at
//     a TS **entry-diagnostic** wall: TS1093 "Type annotation cannot appear
//     on a constructor declaration" (the file's JSDoc `@returns {Error}` on
//     its constructor) + a TS2339/TS2353 cascade. These are `checkJs`-style
//     diagnostics on untyped JS; they are fatal only for an *entry* JS file,
//     not for the same file reached as a dependency in the real graph.
//   - CJS bundle (`dist/node/axios.cjs`) now stops at an unresolved
//     third-party bare import: `Cannot find module 'form-data'`. Per #1032's
//     design these third-party deps (`form-data`/`follow-redirects`/
//     `proxy-from-env`) should route as host imports, not module-not-found.
//   - #TBD-1 (compileProject hang/OOM on the `lib/core/Axios.js` graph) is
//     tracked as #3339 and remains the dominant real-graph blocker.
//
// Existing related issues:
//
//   - #1032 — parent goal (Compile axios to Wasm — Node builtins host imports)
//   - #1042 — async/await state-machine lowering (gates real I/O smoke test)
//   - #1043 — process.env.NODE_ENV DCE (helps the CJS dispatch shim case)
//   - #1044 — Node-builtin host-import routing (gates Tier 4 adapter)
//   - #1287 / #1289 — sibling validation-error patterns in ESLint tier1
//   - #1558 — Linter_verifyAndFix `f64.eq[0]` — shared family with #TBD-3
