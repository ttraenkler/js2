/**
 * (#3780 round 4) Two allocation-volume lowerings for the standalone lane.
 *
 * The standalone acorn self-parse allocates ~58 MB per 226 KB source, of which
 * only ~10 MB is the AST it returns. Two representation changes take ~24.8% off
 * that, and both are pure size/identity questions with no semantic content:
 *
 *  1. **Packed presence flags.** #2847's hidden `$has_<name>` own-presence slot
 *     is correct but was one whole `i32` per conditionally-assigned property.
 *     Acorn's `Node` has 63 of them — 252 bytes of a 536-byte AST node. They
 *     are now bits in `$presence_<w>` words (130 fields → 69).
 *  2. **Interned boolean carriers.** A JS boolean has no observable identity
 *     and its carrier field is immutable, so two module-level carriers suffice.
 *     `__box_boolean` is inlined into every boolean-producing site, so this is
 *     the difference between a GC object and a `global.get` on a path that runs
 *     millions of times per parse.
 *
 * Each ships with a paired control (`JS2WASM_PACKED_PRESENCE_BITS=0`,
 * `JS2WASM_INTERNED_BOOL_BOXES=0`) so the measurement is attributable. The
 * tests below assert the two things that could actually break: that the packed
 * layout still answers own-presence correctly ACROSS A WORD BOUNDARY (the case
 * a single-word implementation would silently pass), and that interning is
 * invisible to boolean semantics.
