/**
 * Issue #267: Yield expression outside of generator function
 *
 * Verifies that diagnostic codes 1163 ("A 'yield' expression is only allowed
 * in a generator body") and 1220 ("Generators are not allowed in an ambient
 * context") are downgraded so they do not block compilation.
 *
 * The TS compiler emits 1163 as a syntactic diagnostic when yield appears
 * inside a generator that it does not recognise (e.g. allowJs mode, class
 * method generators). Adding it to TOLERATED_SYNTAX_CODES prevents the
 * early bail-out for syntax errors.
