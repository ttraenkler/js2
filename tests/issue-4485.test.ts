// (#4485) Builtin-surface smalls in `--target standalone`, four families:
//
//   A — `Error.prototype.toString` composition (§20.5.3.4 / ES5 §15.11.4.4):
//       an OWN `name` written on the instance, and the empty-name / empty-msg
//       arms. The own-`name` half is a WRITE bug, not a formatting one: the
//       standalone `.name` read is a hard `struct.get` of `$Error_struct`
//       field 2, and the write landed elsewhere, so `e.name = "N"; e.name`
//       answered `"Error"`.
//   B — `encodeURI` as a VALUE. Its three siblings (`decodeURI`,
//       `decodeURIComponent`, `encodeURIComponent`) were all reified; it alone
//       was missing from `STANDALONE_ES5_GLOBAL_FUNCTION_NAMES`, so the bare
//       identifier read `null` while a direct CALL worked.
//   C — Annex B `Date.prototype` (§B.2.4): `setYear` / `toGMTString` as own
//       properties, `setYear`'s ToIntegerOrInfinity window, and the §B.2.4.3
//       requirement that `toGMTString` IS `toUTCString` — one function object,
//       not two equivalent ones.
//   D — the Array surface tail (`new Array(2^32)` → a catchable RangeError
//       INSTANCE, `[object Array]`). Pinned as a REGRESSION guard: both
//       already held on this issue's base, measured, not fixed here.
//
// ## Why most pins drive `runTest262File` rather than a bare `compile()`
//
// Measured while writing this file: a `compile(source, {target:"standalone"})`
// probe and the test262 lane DISAGREE on several of these behaviours, in both
// directions. `typeof Date === "function"` is TRUE in a bare probe and FALSE on
// the test262 lane; `e.name = "N"` write-through is the reverse. The lane
// injects a harness (a tag-bearing `class Test262Error`, `deferTopLevelInit`,
// the `$262` prelude) that changes which lowering fires — the same trap
// recorded in `es5-standalone-ctor-identity.test.ts` (#4223/#4232).
//
// So the ROW pins below are the load-bearing ones: each names the exact
// test262 file whose before/after flip was measured for this issue. The few
// direct-`compile` pins that follow are kept only where they agree with the
// lane, as a cheap early signal.
//
// ## Why the row list is a SUBSET of the 18 rows that flipped
//
// A test262 row costs a full compile — 1-12 s here — and a file spending
// ~150 s inside them starved vitest's worker RPC under parallel-agent load:
// the run reported every test passing and then failed the FILE on an
// `onTaskUpdate` timeout. Measured while narrowing it: batching the rows into
// four LONG `it`s made it worse, not better, and the neighbouring
// `es5-standalone-ctor-identity.test.ts` (13 short tasks, ~43 s) is clean —
// so the trigger is the GAP between task boundaries, not the task count.
// Hence: one short `it` per row, and each family pins only the rows that
// DISCRIMINATE — the descriptor row, the arithmetic edge, the identity
// comparison, one already-passing control. The complete 18-row flip list and
// its before/after numbers live in
// `plan/issues/4485-builtin-surface-smalls.md`; the full sweep is the
// directory run, not this file.

 * ONE `it` per row, never a batched loop. A test262 row costs a full compile
 * (1-6 s here), and vitest's worker RPC times out `onTaskUpdate` if too long
 * passes between task boundaries under parallel-agent load: batching 13 rows
 * into 4 long `it`s made the file report every test passing and then FAIL on
 * that timeout. The neighbouring `es5-standalone-ctor-identity.test.ts` is the
 * working shape — many short tasks — so this file copies it.
