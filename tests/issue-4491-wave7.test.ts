 * #4491 wave-7 — the §20.1.3.6 class tag on a DYNAMIC receiver (standalone).
 *
 * One root, measured: `Object.prototype.toString` has two lowerings and only
 * one of them can see a runtime value. The syntactic `…toString.call(v)` form
 * is owned by the #2501 compile-time fold, whose standalone ladder ends in a
 * `[object Object]` that is a FALLBACK, not a classification — and under
 * `allowJs` every `any` receiver lands there. So the tag was answered by a
 * constant that had never looked at the value:
 *
 * ```js
 * var t = function (v) { return Object.prototype.toString.call(v); };
 * t([1,2]); t(function(){}); t(null); t(new String("a")); t(1);
 * //  → "[object Object]" for all five, on the campaign base
 * ```
 *
 * while the same question with a syntactically-visible operand answered
 * correctly. The #4119 RUNTIME classifier could already prove most of them; it
 * was simply not reachable from this spelling.
 *
 * This slice makes it reachable — runtime answer when the classifier can PROVE
 * one, the fold's constant otherwise, never the other way round — and adds the
 * two arms the classifier was missing: the ORDINARY builtin prototypes
 * (`Error.prototype` / `Object.prototype` → `[object Object]`, which used to
 * THROW) and the `arguments` exotic (`[object Arguments]`, which used to read
 * `[object Array]` because both share `$Vec`).
 *
 * Every pin EXECUTES the classification through a receiver the fold cannot
 * read, and the receiver is produced by a helper call or a loop so no
 * compile-time fold can substitute for the path under test. The controls at the
 * end are the ones that must NOT move: a real array still tags `Array` (the
 * Arguments arm runs first, so this is what proves it did not steal the case),
 * a plain object still tags `Object` (the fallback survives), and a statically
 * named Date still folds to `Date` (the fold keeps precedence where it KNOWS,
 * because the classifier cannot prove a Date carrier and would fall back).
 *
 * `it.fails` pins the measured residuals with their owners.
