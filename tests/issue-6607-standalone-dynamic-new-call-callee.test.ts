// #6607 — `new (<call expression>)(…)` under `--target standalone`.
//
// WHY THIS REDUCTION EXISTS. Found by walking down into the compiled
// `@js-temporal/polyfill` provider (#5383 S20). S19 ended at the polyfill's
// intrinsic registry: provider-internal, one module, no link,
// `new (ce("%Temporal.Duration%"))(1).toJSON()` threw *invalid receiver: method
// called with the wrong type of this-object* while `new Duration(1).toJSON()`
// answered `P1Y`. The natural reading — an instance failing its own class's
// brand check — is wrong. **No instance was created at all.**
//
// `compileNewExpression` reached the dynamic-`new` dispatch for a bare
// IDENTIFIER callee, and (JS-host lane only, #4616) for a MEMBER-ACCESS callee.
// A CALL-expression callee matched neither, so it fell through to the
// `__new___unknown` host import — which does not exist in any lane and cannot
// exist in standalone — and the emitted body was a bare `ref.null.extern`.
//
// Two consequences, and the second is the one that makes this look like a
// brand-check bug: the `new` evaluates to null, AND, because the legacy arm
// returns before the argument loop, the argument expressions are never
// evaluated. Downstream the polyfill calls a prototype method on that null and
// its internal-slot lookup reports the wrong-receiver message, several layers
// away from the defect.
//
// Every `resolves.toBe` below is annotated with the value the BASE tree
// produced, measured on this tree by file-copy revert of
// `src/codegen/expressions/new-super.ts` (`.tmp/s20/c6-base.out`,
// `c7-base.out`, `c8-base.out` vs their `-new` twins). This whole FILE was run
// against base that way (`.tmp/s20/test-base.out`): 4 failed, 4 passed — the
// four that fail are the four the change moves, and the four that pass are the
// controls and the two pinned residuals, which must not move.
//
// NOT covered here, on purpose — two residuals this change deliberately did
// NOT touch. Both were PINNED by the last two `it`s so that fixing them would
// fail this file loudly instead of leaving a stale expectation. That is exactly
// what happened to the first of them:
//
//   - a method call by NAME on a statically-unknown receiver resolved through a
//     per-name ladder with no runtime class test, and picked the LAST-declared
//     class that declares the name. It was why the real provider still threw on
//     `Duration.from("P1Y").toJSON()` even though the instance was correct.
//     FIXED by #6608 (S21); the `it` below asserts the fixed answer instead.
//   - `Object.getPrototypeOf(x) === C.prototype` is false for a dynamic-`new`
//     instance (true for a static one), on base and on this branch alike.
