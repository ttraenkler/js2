/**
 * (#4654) A RegExp produced INSIDE runtime `eval` must reach compiled code as a
 * RegExp.
 *
 * ## What was actually wrong (the issue's own reading was off)
 *
 * The issue filed this as "a NUL (`\u0000`) in a regexp source truncates the
 * pattern", from seven rows all reporting
 * `Code unit: 0 — SameValue(«undefined», «"\u0000"»)`. That is not what those
 * rows measure. Every one of them is a `for (cu = 0; cu <= 0xffff; ++cu)` loop
 * whose body does `eval("/" + String.fromCharCode(cu) + "/").source`, so the
 * FIRST iteration is the NUL one and the first iteration is the only one that
 * ever reported. Measured on campaign HEAD c42bdbe3e with a fresh
 * bundle+adapter, `eval("/" + xx + "/").source` answered `undefined` for
 * `String.fromCharCode(97)` too — every code unit, not the NUL.
 *
 * The root is the outward half of the QuickJS eval membrane
 * (`qjsPublish`, scripts/quickjs-eval-provider.mjs). A non-callable QuickJS
 * object crosses out as the #4245-slice-2 MIRRORED BOX: a compiled `$Object`
 * carrying the QuickJS object's own STRING keys. A RegExp instance has exactly
 * one own string key — `lastIndex`. `source`, `flags`, `global`, `ignoreCase`,
 * `multiline`, `sticky`, `exec` and `test` are all %RegExp.prototype% accessors
 * and methods, so the box arrived carrying none of them: measured
 * `instanceof RegExp === false`, `.source === undefined`,
 * `.test(…)` → "called value is not a function", `.lastIndex === 0`.
 *
 * ## The fix, and why these pins are shaped the way they are
 *
 * `qjsPublish` now RECONSTRUCTS a realm RegExp as a real compiled
 * `new RegExp(source, flags)` before the box arm, falling back to the box when
 * construction refuses.
 *
 * That fix rests on one property of the compiled lane which is NOT obvious and
 * which nothing else pins: **`new RegExp(<dynamic>)` does not refuse an
 * unsupported pattern at CONSTRUCTION.** The standalone runtime pattern grammar
 * (regexp-dynamic-pattern.ts) refuses at MATCH time, so `source`/`flags` are
 * right for every pattern and only `test`/`exec` outside that grammar throw. If
 * that ever moved to construction time, the adapter's arm would start throwing
 * mid-publish (or silently fall back to the useless box) and the seven rows
 * would regress with no other test noticing. `describe("construction-time
 * contract")` below is that pin, and it is UNGATED — it runs everywhere,
 * including on a machine with no QuickJS provider, so this file can never be
 * "green" purely by skipping.
 *
 * The behavioural half needs the QuickJS provider linked and self-gates the
 * same way tests/quickjs-eval-membrane.test.ts does. Its eval sources are
 * composed through a runtime loop so `tryStaticEvalInline` cannot fold them:
 * an all-literal `eval("/a/")` is evaluated at COMPILE time and never reaches
 * the membrane at all (measured — the literal form already answered
 * `source === "a"` on the broken build, which is exactly how this defect stayed
 * invisible).
