// gen-test262-mg-matrix.mjs — computes the merge_group-CONSOLIDATED test262
// shard matrix (#3431).
//
// Why merge_group has its own matrix: the queue previously allowed five
// speculative groups to build concurrently. At 114 jobs per group that meant
// up to 570 shard jobs competing for the 120-runner pool; enqueue/dequeue churn
// also invalidated descendant groups and restarted work that could never land.
// The active main ruleset was therefore changed to `max_entries_to_build: 1`.
// With only one stable group in flight, throughput now comes from parallelism
// *inside* that group rather than from keeping the per-group matrix small.
//
// The pool has 120 four-core runners and every shard intentionally uses all
// four cores (`COMPILER_POOL_SIZE=4`). Reserve runners for the overlapping
// CI quality/equivalence jobs, the differential workflow, the Test262 gate,
// and short-lived orchestration jobs. The rest are assigned to Test262, so a
// serial queue entry can use the fleet without starving its other required
// checks.
//
// RESERVE SIZING (#3914, measured 2026-07-31). The reserve was 14, which put
// the matrix at 106 shards. That is over the real ceiling: merge_group run
// 30631849709 started 101 of its 106 shard jobs at t+44-52 s but **5 of them
// at t+90-184 s**, and the last-finishing job in the whole run was one of the
// starved ones (standalone 2/34: started t+134 s, ran 575 s, ended t+709 s).
// Concurrent demand at t+45 s is 106 shards + 13 ci.yml merge_group jobs
// (`changes`, `quality`, `cancel-test262-on-quality-failure`, `linear-tests`,
// `equivalence-shard` x8, `equivalence-gate`) + this workflow's `cheap gate`
// and `changes` = ~121, i.e. just over the 120 ceiling. A 14-runner reserve
// therefore bought 4 extra shards and paid for them with ~89 s of start skew
// on the critical path. 18 is the honest number.
//
// js-host and standalone get DIFFERENT counts because their measured work is
// not equal. RATIO (re-derived from merge_group run 30631849709, 2026-07-31,
// the 72/34 matrix). `Run shard` step timings:
//   js-host:    29,353 runner-seconds total, mean 408 s, max 468 s (72 jobs)
//   standalone: 16,000 runner-seconds total, mean 471 s, max 542 s (34 jobs)
// That is a **1.835** work ratio, NOT the 2.13 the 72/34 split was scaled
// from (measured on run 29807524490 at 34/19, before the lanes' relative cost
// shifted). At 72/34 the lanes are therefore inverted again: standalone is the
// long pole by ~74 s of `Run shard` time. 66/36 = 1.833 matches the measured
// ratio, and at 102 shards both lanes land on ~444 s of mean shard work —
// ~510 s at the observed per-lane max/mean skew (1.147 host, 1.151
// standalone), i.e. within ~2 s of each other, with a ~39 s fixed per-job
// overhead (setup + checkout + install + bundle + upload, median measured)
// on top. Ample margin under the 25-minute job timeout.
//
// Net expected effect vs. 72/34 + reserve 14: the critical shard job goes from
// "starts t+134 s, ends t+709 s" to "starts t+45 s, ends t+~596 s" — about
// 113 s off every src-touching merge_group run. Under a serial queue that is
// a direct throughput gain.
//
// The host lane is costlier primarily because both lanes still compile the
// honest full in-Wasm harness, while the host target emits JS/Wasm interop glue.
// In run 29807524490 host compilation totaled 77.7M ms vs. 42.3M ms for
// standalone; execution was only 2.4M vs. 0.7M ms. Host also reaches more
// passing tests and therefore performs more strict-mode recompilations.
//
// RE-DERIVING THIS: pull the `Run shard` step durations for a completed
// merge_group run, sum them per lane, and split the shard budget by the two
// sums. If one lane's max job is consistently more than ~1 min past the
// other's, the ratio has drifted again — that is the signal to redo it, and
// it has now drifted twice (2.13 -> 1.835), so treat it as a recurring check
// rather than a constant.
//
// The underlying partition (assignBalancedChunk, test262-shared.ts) is a
// pure function of (chunkIndex, totalChunks): it re-derives the FULL test262
// corpus and greedily bin-packs it into `totalChunks` bins by historical
// duration, so it produces a strict, non-overlapping, full-coverage
// partition for ANY totalChunks >= 1 — changing the shard count here cannot
// drop or duplicate tests. See tests/issue-3431-mg-matrix.test.ts for a
// dry-run check of this script's output shape, and
// tests/test262-chunk-dynamic.test.ts for the runtime entry point each
// matrix cell invokes (index/total supplied via env vars instead of being
// baked into a per-shard filename).
