/**
 * #4162 — THE single place a test262 execution lane turns a compiled binary
 * plus a base import object into a live `WebAssembly.Instance`.
 *
 * There are three lanes that execute a compiled test262 module:
 *
 *   1. `scripts/test262-worker.mjs`      — the sharded CI fork worker
 *   2. `tests/test262-shared.ts`         — the in-process fixture-graph lane
 *   3. `tests/test262-runner.ts`         — `runTest262File`, used in-process by
 *      `scripts/validate-test262-baseline.ts`, `scripts/detect-vacuity.ts`,
 *      `scripts/harness-flip-probe.ts` and ad-hoc A/B measurement
 *
 * They must agree about WHICH import namespaces a given binary gets, because a
 * namespace supplied to one lane and not another does not merely lose tests —
 * **it overwrites their real error signature with an instantiation artifact.**
 * A descriptor test that would report `Test262Error: Expected obj[0] to be
 * writable` instead reports
 *
 *     TypeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Import #0 module="js2wasm:runtime-eval":
 *                module is not an object or function
 *
 * so every bucket histogram, cluster analysis and A/B built on the divergent
 * lane is measuring the instrument's own gap and attributing it to the
 * compiler. Measured 2026-08-06 across three independent ES5-standalone levers:
 * 82/162, 44/152, and a third hit that was not counted — roughly half of two
 * levers was instrument artifact, which is how a real mechanism gets sized at
 * +0 and abandoned. On the 162-file lever, 18 of the 82 masked files were
 * actually PASSING.
 *
 * It also corrupted `scripts/validate-test262-baseline.ts` (#2095), which the
 * #1897 standalone floor rests on: on clean main a 50-row standalone sample
 * carried two baseline-`pass` rows scored `fail` purely on this link error.
 *
 * This is the THIRD instance of one drift class. #3441 unified the sandbox
 * globals (`scripts/test262-sandbox-globals.mjs`) after the drift stranded
 * ~2,069 TypedArray-ctor tests; #3613 unified the thrown-payload renderer
 * (`scripts/lib/wasm-exn-render.mjs`) after the local lane reported an opaque
 * label where CI reported the real assertion text. Both were first diagnosed
 * as one-offs. The pattern is that `test262-worker.mjs` accretes fidelity fixes
 * and the in-process lanes do not.
 *
 * THE RULE, so there is not a fourth: a test262 lane does not call
 * `WebAssembly.instantiate` on a test binary itself. It calls
 * `instantiateTest262Module`. Any import namespace whose supply is CONDITIONAL
 * on the compiled module's own import list belongs in `attachConditionalImportNamespaces`
 * below and nowhere else. `tests/issue-4162.test.ts` fails the build if a lane
 * grows its own instantiate again.
