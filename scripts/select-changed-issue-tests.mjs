// (#4448) Print the `tests/issue-*.test.ts` and `tests/ir/*.test.ts` files a PR
// should run.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: none of the six required checks executes that suite —
// `equivalence-gate` runs `tests/equivalence/` only, `quality` runs
// lint/ratchets/named files, the test262 jobs run conformance, `linear-tests`
// runs the linear subset. So an issue test file can be BORN red (#4430's was)
// or go red later (`6203320a` did, silently, for two days) with every gate
// green. Running the whole suite on every PR is too slow to be worth it, so the
// cheap 90 % is: run the files the PR itself touches, plus a tiny pinned set.
//
// (#3521 R2-T1) `tests/ir/*.test.ts` had the same gap and it cost the same way:
// `cb733cde37` reddened `tests/ir/fnctor-producer.test.ts` and `0f42c1fde4`
// reddened `tests/ir/counted-string-append-provenance.test.ts`, both unseen.
// Note what each half of this change does and does not catch: BOTH of those
// commits are src-only, so the directory regex below — which matches changed
// TEST paths — would not have selected either. What catches a src-driven red
// is the PIN; the regex catches the case where a PR touches a tests/ir file
// itself. Only the six R2-named files are pinned (fatal), 44.8 s of wall clock
// against 140.8 s for all 19 green ones, so the 13 unpinned green files stay
// invisible to a src-only PR — that residue is deliberate, not closed.
//
// Deliberately NOT a required check — see docs/ci-policy.md §7. A changed issue
// test may be red for reasons the PR is not responsible for (the suite is not
// clean on main today), so this reports rather than blocks.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/select-changed-issue-tests.mjs --pinned  [--max <n>]
//   node scripts/select-changed-issue-tests.mjs --changed [--base <sha>] [--max <n>]
//
// The two modes exist because they carry different authority. `--pinned` lists
// files verified green on main, so a failure there is a genuine regression and
// its CI step is FATAL. `--changed` lists whatever the PR touched, whose health
// on main is unknown, so its step is ADVISORY — a red non-required check drives
// `mergeStateStatus` to UNSTABLE, which `auto-enqueue` skips outright
// (#3878/#3904), and stranding a PR behind a test that was already red is a
// worse failure than the one this job exists to catch.
//
// Prints one path per line on stdout (empty output = nothing to run).
// Diagnostics go to stderr so stdout stays pipe-safe.

  // the repo behind a green CI. Pin them so each is fatal from now on.
