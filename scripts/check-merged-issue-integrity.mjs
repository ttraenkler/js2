// PR-time issue-integrity gate against a SIMULATED MERGE with main (#2530).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// `scripts/check-committed-issue-integrity.mjs` runs the duplicate-ID /
// filename-mismatch / dangling-depends_on gate against a single committed tree
// (default HEAD). On a `pull_request` event the `quality` job runs it on the
// PR's own branch tip — but that branch was cut from an OLDER `main`. If a
// sibling PR has since merged a `plan/issues/<id>-<slug>.md` with the SAME id,
// the collision is invisible on the stale branch and the check passes. The
// collision only surfaces later in the `merge_group` run (which validates
// `main + PR`), where it fails the `quality` job repeatedly and WEDGES the
// merge queue with "N duplicate IDs" (see
// .claude/memory/project_merge_queue_dup_issue_id_churn.md).
//
// This wrapper closes that gap: it computes the tree that WOULD result from
// merging current `origin/main` into the PR head (via `git merge-tree
// --write-tree`, which touches neither the index nor the working tree), then
// runs the committed-integrity check against that merged tree. A stale-base
// id collision therefore fails the PR's OWN `quality` check, before it can
// reach — and wedge — the merge queue.
//
// USAGE
//   node scripts/check-merged-issue-integrity.mjs [<base-ref>] [<head-ref>]
//     base-ref  default: origin/main  (the branch the PR will merge INTO)
//     head-ref  default: HEAD         (the PR head)
//
// BEHAVIOUR
//   - If the base ref cannot be resolved (e.g. `origin/main` not fetched in a
//     shallow checkout, or a non-PR context), the check SKIPS cleanly (exit 0)
//     with a diagnostic — it never blocks a build it cannot reason about.
//   - If `git merge-tree` reports merge conflicts, the merged tree OID is still
//     printed on its first line; we proceed to run the integrity check against
//     it (a content conflict inside an issue file does not change its id, so the
//     dup-id signal is still valid). We surface the conflict as a note.
